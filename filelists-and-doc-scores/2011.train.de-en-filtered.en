People 's Party won seats in the Congress to 4 and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November could the PP Lérida in the cities , Tarragona play a decisive role and Barcelona
After the major stimmen- and abgeordnetenzuwachs in the recent regional elections is the PP their view already on the parliamentary - or not preferred . Their expectations are more than positive , because the votes , the this party in these elections , is normally twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia .
So , the Catalan people 's party 610.473 vote in the parliamentary elections of 2008 , during this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222 fraud .
Last Sunday the PPC reached 384.091 votes .
If this rising trend - outcome of the diversion cut rich-country voting shares at the PSC and the pegging of the electorate of the PP - should continue , predict the analysts of the PP that in the parliamentary elections the PPC from 8 to 12 Members could rise , while also ciu four ( it has now 10 ) before and the PSC at least 9 members ( of 25 ) would lose .
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE .
According to the analysis of the People 's Party would lose the ERC a Member - currently it has three - while icv their Members or a gain much could keep .
However , the wahlkalender should be maintained , and the next deadline with the local elections in the May 2011 . Also then can the People 's Party ( PP ) the voice of the balance of the Socialist domination , in order to put an end , in four provinzhauptstädten and with its majority in the City Council emblematic , one of the municipalities with the largest budget : 661 million euro for 2011 .
Both the nationalists and the People 's Party agree , the PSC the towns of Barcelona , Tarragona , Lérida and Gerona , in which the Socialists neither a majority still on its traditional allies ( ERC and icv ) can make use , will lose .
After the Republican debacle is it not absurd that this party their representation in the town council emblematic in which they should reach 5 % of the vote , will lose .
On the other hand , the PP recorded an increase in their stimmenanteils in the four provinzhauptstädten and could to the decisive force in Barcelona , Lérida and Tarragona .
The nationalists are convinced that the major role to play in tarragonas turnaround . There they had before the current mayor , Josep Félix ballesteros , together with the PP governed .
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC . The mayor , àngel Ros , maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the recent election campaign you met several times .
Also in other important areas , such as , for example , in badalona castelldefels or reus , the People 's Party was a significant growth .
Currently , the PP represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia , and they are seeking the education of lists in so many places as possible .

In the race for WikiLeaks head
Obama will appoint a high those responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf on the prevention of new revelations .
Interpol is a red warning to the persecution and capable of Assange .
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founders , jullian Assange , is a complicated labyrinth , in which the only difficult to investigate the facts .
Interpol yesterday was a 'red warning `` to '' search and persecution ' of Assange .
However , this is not a traditional orders to arrest .
In addition , it is not new , it comes from the 20 November .
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States , but with the accusations of sexual abuse , which the Australians in Sweden .
It also assured the advocate of the founder of WikiLeaks , mark Stephens , `` the police would know where and how they contact with Mr Assange . ''
On 20 was already the international police authority with headquarters in Lyon ( France ) at the request of Sweden ordering from , but it was up to yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities .
That is the way things are interpol-länder . The 188 , Assange need to identify and , presumably , `` to provisionally arrest and hand it . ''
Although Interpol the arrest of a of a red warning affected individual not can impose , many consider Member States according to the organisation of the Red warning as a licence for a arrestierung - the of the national police forces must be carried out , in particular , if you have a bilateral extradition agreements , as is the case of Sweden and England , where Assange probably .
The approach is outraged assanges lawyers , the gestures , published a letter in which you about it , that the 39-year-old founders of WikiLeaks is prepared by video conference , the questions of the Swedish authorities to answer .
They also recall that Assange the departure from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor , the with the sagenumwobenen lavrentiy pavlovich Beria , security chief of Stalin , compared to the corresponding authorisation .
`` This is like a hunting , not as a legal persecution ' , will , in the letter .
While the world is seeking him - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son claimed - that Assange in an unknown location to , but not in silence .
On Monday he was the head of the magazine time by Skype from a vague place from an interview . In the conversation , he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States , Hillary Clinton .
`` if it can be proven that it was responsible for the classification of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and international agreements signed by the United States has broken , they should resign , '' he said .
His opinion was yesterday by the pressesekretär of the White House , Robert Gibbs , condemned , of the request for resignation as `` ridiculous and absurd . ''
'I am not sure why we value to the opinion of a type with a website should lay , `` he told the CNN .
Obama himself has a high those responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf , rusell Travers , with the prevention of new dokumentenenthüllungen .
The attempt by the spokesperson of the präsidenden Barack Obama , Assange less attention , is contrary to the opinions , the conservative politicians and commentators in these days .
Congressman Peter King , the from January the Presidency of the House of Representatives in the national sicherheitskommitee will lead the staatsabteilung , has the possibility to investigate WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organisations , 'in order to put their money to seize and all the support it or to make a contribution to follow. ``
Tom flanagan , consultants , of the Canadian President Stephen Harper , was gone even further , and he had to his statement , Assange `` are murdered '' revoked .
`` Obama would have to turn it into a target and a not manned flight or so what use . ''
Who is not apologising , was Mike Huckabee , baptistischer Minister , a former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate .
'who it was who in the government information leaked , he is guilty of treason and everything is no execution is eiine to mild punishment , `` he told the sender Fox .

Obama stop new drilling for oil
Off the coast of Florida us-bundesstaats in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years , there will be no new drilling for oil .
A ban has the government in Washington - and , therefore , their previous plans definitively revoked .
Even before the Atlantic coast new drilling for the time being , remain prohibited .
This shared Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday with .
The trigger for the strict ban on , at least for the next five years is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon `` bohrplattform '' in April .
Before the accident , which cost the lives of eleven workers and on the biggest environmental disaster in the United States , President Barack Obama had led to pressure from the opposition and the industry his readiness , new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico .
The supporters want so that the dependence of the United States of oil supplies from abroad .
Who was responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf , is still not finally resolved .
In the centre of the criticism is the British energy company BP , faced with milliardenforderungen .
A fact-finding mission on behalf of Obama 's is , in the course of December 2008 to present its results .
In October was Interior Minister Ken Salazar the after the explosion bohrstopp imposed lifted .
In the end have had several oil companies immediately requests for new bohrvorhaben .
With more stringent controls and stricter safety rules want Obama and Salazar a fresh disaster .
At the moment the competent supervisory authority , the following many corruption charges was in disrepute , radically reformed .

`` I reserve my reasons for my European trading partners ( ... ) ' .
Jean-Claude Trichet , President of the ECB , the previous day in Brussels , during his hearing from the Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament not very redegewandt regarding its projects , but rather , to point out that the programme of the purchases of staatspapieren in secondary markets ' `` would be allowed to continue and that we in the House on Thursday 'will see how the decisions will be ' .
Only certainty : the ECB is its main interest rate remains unchanged at 1 % , the lowest level since May 2009 .
In practice , the obligationskäufe the schatzkammer last week by the ECB to around EUR 1,35 billion doubled .
And according to the leaks of some traders should it yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese staatspapieren have made .
Overall , the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 purchases in the sum of EUR 67 billion .
Under the dealers will the anticipation of a weiterverfolgens not questioned the kaufkurses ( see side 29 ) .
The economists already not remarkable change of course expect more .
If the anleihengeschäfte of more than three months already from the arsenal of the ECB will have disappeared , will the latter still to the full geldmittelreserven freigiebige kind to make to create , and over a period of a week of up to three months .
The economists are already taken today , that this measure will extend some months .
`` I can not imagine that the ECB amend its programme to essential way ' .
`` If not , would you take the risk of new tensions in the short term , '' to provoke suspected Michael schubert Commerzbank , the economist .
'a for the course of the first quarter of 2011 nominated , progressive withdrawal seems to me more likely , '' anticipating them , for its part , Norbert bräms , economist in sal .
Oppenheim .
In the area of their interventions in the market of the national debt `` the ECB should such a kaufvolumen aufrechthalten in bonds , that the sluggish market stimulates ' , adds Norbert bräms .
In view of the relevance of the vulnerable position of European banks on the markets of the national debt in the euro area , the Central Bank has no other choice but to maintain their presence on the market .
`` You must at any price to the steller the lack of investors on the market and so act to the premature nature of enthusiasm about the to the weakest States paid to prevent returns , '' an important obligationeninhaber bezeugte yesterday .
Because if interest rates on the boom , would even more from the States , to reduce their debt , or even just to stabilise .
This is the price for the protection of the euro .

Affaire Clotilde Reiss : the elysée-palast exaggerates its mittlerfunktion for Syria
In the space of more than six months , of July 2009 to May 2010 , considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss , a young French researcher , the in Iran for `` spying '' has been laid down in the French public life , left the diplomacy in alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran .
All of this under the thoughtful look the diplomats of the United States .
The by WikiLeaks and received by the newspaper 'Le Monde ' durchgesehenen American documents some background to this crisis price .
You describe how the Elysée the Americans had declared its strategy , which , as far as this advice to deal with their own crisis of `` hostage-taking '' in Iran ( a small group of wanderern ) .
They show , as the French leaders have tried to convince , Washington that the liberation of young French person , not the release of Majid kakavand , one in France and held prisoner by the American justice because of trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes fugitive iraners to gegeleistung have .
After all , the way in which the French Presidency for the media to manipulate the purposes , has tried to make this the idea credible , the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad have a central role to play in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss , played in a harsh light .
In truth , he had done nothing in this respect .
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm bears the title 'Iran : French comments about the way of dealing with hostage taking. ``
François richier , elysée-berater -- is maintained in the company of Patrice paoli , Director of the Quai d 'orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone .
They declared her French method .
The advised the Americans to do everything to ensure that their own nationals , the violently rückzuführen held in Iran .
`` power noise ' , they said , ' articulated loud and clear , without letting up ' , the words ' grundmenschenrechte ' , ' innocence ' , ' immediate release 'in the media .
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime to embarrass , the very sensitive to its image .
`` policy , all the more so given that you ask the Iranians that not to do so ' .
Because 'silence solves nothing ' , over the diskussionsversuche on on unauffälligem ways , the Iranians are `` masters in ausweichmanövern . ''
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners a `` normal , Iranian tactics '' was : 'hostage taking for political blackmail ' .
It announces the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss ( which should be reached on 16 August , on the day that they are in the French embassy vanishes ) 'demand the payment of a large payout to the Iranians ' ( 230,000 Euro bail ) .
And he does state that the Elysée antizipiere further hostage taking , a phenomenon that , `` will exacerbate . ''
Could the Iranians ' in the near future , a other of the approximately 1,800 French citizens arrest , living in Iran , `` he said .
28 August 2009 .
Clotilde Reiss is twelve days been released from jail , will , however , continue to in Iran .
An information has been in circulation , the Iranians Majid kakavand , whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial to Iran , is after decision of a judge in Paris has been released from detention .
The American Embassy is , as many other observers , questions about this disturbing coincidence .
For Washington , that the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material envisaged for the nuclear programme , is the release of Majid khakavand a bad news .
France has a horse trading in ?
The liberation of the iraners against the French person ?
On the occasion of a further meeting with Kathleen allegrone on 4 September François richier assured that this was not the case .
The Elysée , he says , was not just 'completely surprised by the decision of the judge , `` but have also tried , against the authorities .
`` It has a rain exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice ' ( currently given Michèle Alliot-Marie ) , but '' the French government can do not change the judicial decision , `` he says .
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand to remain under 'strict ' supervision of the French secret service .
The elysée-berater opts for a telephone number , sets back on , then informed the American diplomat , the Iranians ' is currently in the chair of the Iranian Embassy buildings in Paris. ``
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée not spare its efforts , through statements and of the media organized `` fluchtversuche '' believe , the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad Games a `` important '' and `` influential role as mediator . ''
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and conclude that the manipulation bears fruit , since several articles in the press the official French version .
A on 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram rebellion evokes `` the medienblitz of the French authorities ' .
What is based so much `` dankesbezeugung 'to Mr Assad , the Paris message .
`` despite their statements give full lobpreis tacitly to the French authorities that they have only a vague idea about what the syrier actually have done ' .
The document also deals with the reasons that have led the Elysée this fiction to lapse .
The intensive communication efforts ' aims , Sarkozy 's policy of opening up towards Syria to confirm , `` he analysed .
Policy , launched a 2008 , the then `` of numerous kritikerstimmen , in France and in the outside world as premature and unverdient was perceived ' .
`` The Syrian role aufbauschend 'attempts Paris '' Syria , we can achieve what belobigung by a constructive role in the region ' .
The aim is , moreover , `` discord between Syria and Iran to sow . ''
The American Embassy know this from good source .
On 11 August François richier had to her , `` of course we do not know whether the syrier whatever have ' .
`` But we have , in spite of everything , we thank you . '
`` this should at least cause confusion on the part of the Iranians ' .
Clotilde Reiss , on 16 May 2010 back to France .
Nicolas Sarkozy it receives in the Elysée .
In a communiqué thanks it the President of Brazil , of Senegal and Syria for its active role in favour of the release of our fellow countryman. ``

The FIFA World Cup 2018-2022 appoints the in :
In a state of great excitement because of corruption will appoint the Executive Committee of the FIFA World Cup on Thursday the ausrichterländer 2018 and 2022 , a highly political choice , in which the rangeln for influence and the lobbying the technical criteria to press in the background .
One thing is certain : the issuing 2018 the accepted the FIFA will in Europe , of their traditional stronghold , take place ( the 4 candidates : England , Russia , spanien-portugal , niederlande-belgien ) .
The issuing 2022 will then be something for exotic ; the International Football Federation hopes , after the first on the African continent in the years 2010 new territories ( Qatar , Australia ) for themselves to win , or its establishment in the United States or in the Far East ( Japan , South Korea ) to continue to pursue .
The list of personalities , loyalty to the delegation ( David Cameron , Prince William , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , José Socrates , Bill Clinton , the Emir of Qatar , the Belgian and Dutch head of government , Zidane , Beckham , Cruyff ) is the level of economic and political use of a World Cup .
The machinations behind the scenes , therefore , face up to the last minute .
Difficult otherwise , a hierarchy of candidates .
After the an evaluation report of FIFA , the English , offer spanisch-portugiesische ( 2018 ) and American ( 2022 ) acts bessseren arguments than those of their competitors .
But these considerations will be for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees the moment of choice is not as great .
The Sunday Times , the with the achievement of the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees ( reynald temarii and Amos Adamu ) at the beginning of the revelations , might as well the opportunities for their own country , cradle of football , can ruin , the only once the World Cup was allowed to thrash out , namely in 1966 .
The BBC was once again the on Monday breeding ground by you own had a broadcast , of the three influential members of the kommitees , namely Ricardo Teixeira , Nicolas leoz and Issas hayatou under attack .
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and the English responsible to embarrass , in the first place , with David Cameron in these last few weeks an intensive lobbying .
The head of government hopes for a relaunch of the from his predecessor , Tony Blair successful schachzuges , the London in 2005 for the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012 had reached .
This intensive use would be sufficient to the image of England before the kommitee revalue again ?
Nothing is less safe , because the duo spanien-portugal does not lack assets , with its already finished stadiums , its expertise ( World Cup 82 in Spain , Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona , Euro 2004 in Portugal ) and its fußballkultur .
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen their ambitions .
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal to the opportunities of Russia , which , despite its shortcomings in the dossier ( stadiums , hotels , transport ) to the weighty outsiders , increase .
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has , however , decided , the unumwundenen suggestion on the bezichtigungen the English press `` an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote 'on the part of the kommiteemitglieder condemned .
`` You bewirft you with dirt , trying to compromise , '' Putin raged .
The United States for 2022 seem , strengthened by the experience of 1994 , the logical favourites .
First , the headquarters of the fifa-hauptsponsoren economic world power , the country seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea which separately have set a very good project .
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries , the competitions co-organised had in 2002 .
Another threat : the FIFA World Cup allocation of the long-awaited 2026 for China and the Asian opportunities on 2022 lapses .
With Australia and Qatar , that with the aufwartung futuristischer stages of all , is following the FIFA had their extension in the direction of new areas , however , these two countries a greater risk , because certainty .
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea under the of the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights ( due to the zeitverschiebung ) , the sensitive nerve FIFA .

Climate such as France his finanzversprechen amount :
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty , it is time to compliance with the quickly resolved financing pledge ( also 'almost start ' or premature financing mentioned ) to investigate the of the developing countries have been realised .
And are already the gross French vulnerable to blandishments exposed .
With the Copenhagen Treaty , the developing countries committed to $ 30 billion between 2010 and 2012 .
The EU has EUR 7.2 billion over three years , France 1.26 billion promised ( that is to say EUR 420 million per year ) .
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 has the EU all its partners of the fact of their commitments regarding the fast-start-finanzierungen : detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht to convince the Member States to press conference , great nebenevents , broschürenverteilung .
The operation transparency is remarkable and extent of their actual value estimated : the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same for the same präzisionsniveau .
The EU , announced in the years 2010 to have released EUR 2.2 billion , what they are on the right road to respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012 .
But if we look into the details , things are a little more complicated .
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty `` new '' and , in addition , in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled , without , at the expense of public aid for development .
Unfortunately , there is no consensus about what 'new and additional ' means .
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation , have certain Member States , including France , the procedure is being blocked .
Today everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers as best .
The European Commission has , for example , as a benchmark for those of 2009 : the international financing , for their attacks are maintained , and is within the framework of funding 'fast-start `` 150 million over three years .
Other countries have similar indicative values , either as regards year or concerning conditions at the level of public development aid .
On the other hand , France was of the opinion that the financing 'of all new projects ' of the year 2010 `` are new , and in addition ' .
In other words , there is no indicative values in the expenditure of the previous year or at a global level of public development aid .
Specifically , the total amount of the French support of the developing countries remain stable ( or decline ) - France is , his commitment to the `` new and additional 'funding .
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans .
There is still no rule , and everyone chooses its rechenmodus .
Some , such as , for example , France , are 1 borrowed €as being equivalent to 1 donated € .
This is apparently only difficult acceptable that the effort is not comparable .
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment ( and often to the emissionseindämmung tied projects to be based actually technology ) can not be justified , it is illusory to present the euro , known as the equivalent of a donated euro captured ... should also only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland as a commitment to be counted ( that is the equivalent of the interest rate ) .
But France has nothing else in the sense as the following consideration : it 'respect ' his commitment of EUR 420 million by 91,5 % loans ( 389,8 million euro ) and 8.5 % donates ) 36,1 million euro ) - see the EU documents , in order to convince themselves .
France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent .
Germany is calling for 46 % , while Denmark , the Netherlands , or Slovakia ( among other things ) their commitments to 100 % with donations .
In other words , if the vast majority of European Union 1 €to fulfil their obligations , France spends just 10 cents and understands including a comparable efforts .
Fine hocus-pocus !
All in all , France in its fast-start-finanzierung operates with a double fraud : a part with a weiterentwicklkung of action over time , and , on the other part with the reality of the financial commitment .
France manage it , believe that it 420 million `` new and additional '' million in accordance with its promise has spent , and it saves it 36,1 million euro .
The manipulation of the Finance Ministry ( as it appears that it was Bercy , of the arbitrage has carried out a double ) could lead to negative effect ; even internally ( why the other Member States with the donations , but if there is enough to lend ? ) , and then in the negotiations , as the developing countries is not completely misled ...
The chapter of the premature finance only a small issue in a relatively short time in comparison with the entirety of discussions on the climate .
But it could the drop of too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC .
We hope that this will not be the case .
As it always was , it is essential to its lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn .
First and foremost , France could a change in its verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012 , and to do so in a spirit of respect for its commitments and of the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union .
Above all , however , France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of the long-term financing forward ( another , decisive and now discussed subject ) : you can escape the question of the 'verrechenbarkeit ' or the verbuchungsart its loans not .
France could change its position as progressive as regards the issues to be , as it is for other things .
The hope is based , therefore , on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet , the next week in Cancun will arrive .
A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and its vision of the `` verrechenbarkeit ' , and of the use of loans would the international nature , to raise the necessary basis for further discussions .

A long finger than ringfinger means lower risk to developing cancer
Men , the finger is long , as the ringfinger , are obviously a lower risk , to prostate cancer to become ill .
This is a surprising result of a study that on the Wednesday of the British journal of cancer has been published .
This is the mirror of male hormone testosterone .
`` Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for prostate cancer can serve the risk and this particular at men to sixty ' , said the mitautorin the study on krebsforschungsinstitut Ros eeles , a professor at the university in WARWICK .
The finger could help to determine which men is necessarily a prostatakrebs-test should undergo , especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are available , such as , for example , family health problems , added Mrs eeles .
In the period from 1994-2009 pursued it with their colleagues in Britain more than 1 500 patients with prostate cancer , but at the same time , the 3 000 healthy men .
In more than half of all the participants of the study was the finger of the right hand shorter than the ringfinger .
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer , as for 19 % of those men , whose 'ring ' and finger equal long .
In men , their finger longer than the ringfinger was , however , this risk fell by 33 % , in men to sixty even 87 % .
The relationship of the length of the two mentioned finger , which is already in the prenatal age are obviously reflects the different mirror of geschlechtshormonen , which the child in the womb was exposed .
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer fingers .
Former research found that it is precisely the testosterone growth accelerated prostate cancer .
Václav pačes , leading Czech geneticists and a former chairman of the Academy of Sciences čtk , said that he was aware of this study fleetingly , he think , nevertheless , that the relationship between the fingerlänge and the risk of cancer have not so far proved to be totally 'for ' .

The architects saw a - the office is also a nursery
The office buildings avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company arch.design .
But who would expect a minikindergarten here , with all what this includes : farbenfrohen walls , creative furniture , a lot of toys and even a minispielplatz on the außenterrasse .

The bauingenieurinnen and -architektinnen have it so easier , its ambitious work and the care of children .
The minikindergarten is an original idea of staff ( within ) by arch.design and with the support of the management managed financial assistance from the European Union and of the Ministry of work and Social Affairs for their project to win .
The occupational minikindergarten by means of the operationsprogramm human resources and employment policy from the resources of the European Social Fund and from the state reacts to the Czech Republic .

After the utilisation of the funds ( 2 years ) is the society arch.design committed to the minikindergarten 3 years to at their own expense .
The preparation of this project , a whole year , and the society economy rating in the antragsabwicklung active assistance .
The children are ganztätig qualified personnel - a nurse and a kindergartenlehrerin , the kindergarten school children can visit without altersmäßige restrictions , although most of you on three years old .
And , because there is a mini-kindergarten only 5 children , must be present at the same time , however , the day change over a number of children from each other .
The kindergartenbetrieb is flexible in the needs of parents voted , the children of all staff have in relation to the use of the kindergartens the same rights - without regard to the firmenhierarchie and their respective positions .
Although it is individual education and care , the programminhalt in mini-kindergarten nevertheless , comparable with the framework programme of pre-school education brings .
The children play not only here , above all , will you excellent teaching needed - of basic knowledge to vorschulunterricht , incidentally , they still learn English .
Not only is the classroom and creative play with toys , but also with a computer , of the children is available .
What is more , the presence of small children in the company is contributing to a kind and positive firmenmilieu .
Parents can at any time , a look at the children , and so is the stress during late , take the children from a far-off nursery school .
That is why the parents use of their working time more productive .
No wonder that this also natural and loyal relations are developing .
Arch.design included so under the Czech firms , the in the recruitment of new staff to provide significant benefits , '' the family-friendly by such programmes are and their personnel marketing .

The new unity will take place no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new , the unity of the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean charest many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry committee on this subject .
Robert dutil , Minister of public safety , claims that this idea come not yesterday : Quebec would have already last January the New York department of investigation consulted on this issue .
The metropolis since 1870 on a standing unity against corruption .
Nevertheless , the announcement by Wednesday has more than just a surprise .
We have to say that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the quebecer police force on 29 October of last year , despite the presence of Robert dutils not in the least been discussed .
There was also not that Stéphane bergeron , critics and Member of the Parti québécois , this announcement in terms of public security as `` out of the hat gezaubertes rabbit 'and ' on a will rightly gebastelte solution 'qualified .
Minister dutil had written in turn to those who fear that the political power too much influence on the future unity can have .

`` It is aware of this matter . ''
In accordance with réjean parent , the President of the csq , nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey .

In order to escape from this impasse , it proposes the Quebec , the finanzprüfungskontrolle a specific mandate , so that these on corruption and hidden agreements appropriate investigations .
`` You should be able to extend the mandate of the prüfungskontrolle , '' he decided .
It is also of the opinion that the Quebec of prüfungskontrolle could give the same powers as Commissioners , whatever you would allow the people to commit to the statement .

Weak applause for China
Taiwan 's voters are slowly closer connection to the mainland .
What does Taiwan of its big brother across the straits ?
On 27 November , more than 7.5 million voters , 70 % of the electorate , in order in the five city mayors and councillors . This is as broad evaluation of the President Ma Ying-jeou .
The creation of a partial einschl . cutting-edge business contacts , Ma itself free trade agreement , is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland . Its policy has the relationship with the Chinese Motherland , for the first time since 1949 lasting changes .
Ma has the tests , but only just .
Although his Kuomintang Party was split ( KMT ) three of the five mayor , it received no majority .
Instead , the democratic fortschrittspartei ( DPP ) , the greater independence for Taiwan , almost 50 % of the vote , the KMT was 45 % .
In a presidential election , this would have for Ma problems means .
Since his election two years ago is the part of his party by around 8 % .
For the first time , the DPP even together with the KMT in town councils .
During the election , there was the usual cases like convoys of lorries in Taiwan , with krawallmachern flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and sparse dancers , broke ranks .
There were even the compulsory , mysterious mordversuch .
Sean LIEN , the son of Lien Chan and ehrenvorsitzender the KMT , on the eve of the election a speech to a kmt-kandidaten ,
As a man from the amount in the face of fold . LIEN was a umstehender viewers killed and wounded .
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter LIEN kill or a dispute with the candidates wanted to resolve .
Regardless of the attack has tsai ing-wen according to the leader of the DPP , the election affected and the DPP in a bad light , what the KMT has provided more votes .
China was perhaps the biggest winners of the campaign .
Remarkably , the relations with the mainland was not raised .
Instead , the candidates debated on plans to social housing and the creation of jobs .
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China 's militärbedrohung .
This is why the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the forefront .
But this time , also avoided the DPP , the anti-Chinese feelings too much .
You responded to the new awareness that Taiwan 's economy without China can not survive .
Ma , for its part , would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese his China policy .
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy , Taiwan , with economic incentives to attract the Community .
China sent a negotiators immediately after Taipei , at a summit on security of investment and medical cooperation .
Certainly , it also wants a political integration , but the most important first .
It is so dear to the 2012 presidential election .
The DPP is now reinvented .
Two years ago , it was severely weakened : the former party leader , Chen Shui-bian was sitting in prison for corruption .
During its Presidency , between 2000 and 2008 , he was strongly for the absolute independence .
But under tais reign spans developed into a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the young .
As a presidential candidate , Mrs tsai was the DPP huge agreement , like Su tseng-chang under Chen .
Your party is doing everything now , in order to show that it is in a position to establish close relations with Beijing .
Tsai is planning a ideenschmiede as a contact point between the DPP and China . This , however , presupposes open-minded discussion .
Tsai stated publicly that your party a `` trustworthy alternative 'offer to MAS vorschneller approach to China .
Chen seems very annoyed about this change .
From his he declared that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan 's independence .
He called for the pragmatists Su even , to run for president .
Even without Chen 's interference does the DPP difficult , their possible candidates to choose .
The KMT will need to undergo a own selbstanalyse .
MAS values are poor , in spite of the rapid economic growth ; the kmt-kandidaten wanted to lead their campaign without him .
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor .
According to a statement of a kmt-sprechers it will be cabinet and the local institutions .
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement , only restricted .
At the same time , most of the Taiwanese people see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable .
According to Antonio Chiang , a prominent columnists , `` there is already a point of no return ' .

At least in the discussions .
We call on this , in particular , the 23 billion for the underground grand Paris in memory , the of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built .
The baubeginn the SGP , the state has a kapitaldotation of EUR 4 billion has been declared .
In the theoretical scheme of this is the sum of the SGP then , on the markets would allow a part of the finanzsumme to their dual .
Today it is , after all , to first projections .
The amending budget by 2010 , this morning by the finanzkommission looked through the national assembly , contains the measures provided for in the first part of this money .
It is two measures : the creation of a special tax on erschließund and higher taxation of the offices at the ile-de France .
The former , Article 15 of the draft law funding , is `` to the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris . ''
This is quantified : `` the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year ' .
Zweitere is a reorganisation of the already existing taxation : `` in order to modernise the from their educational product and to increase this increase in the Société du Grand Paris to entrust . ''
How much would tabling ?
A puzzle .
This amount is not in the text .
Of the 4 billion is a long way away .
'It is stated that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of the kapitaldotation be added , which will be found by the state and the Société du Grand Paris to and after for the project to be done ' , as is clear from the explanatory statement .
In the SGP will take place this system is not offensive .
`` since the moment in which the income has been recorded ( the two taxes , that R. ) , the studies on three years and then cover only from the 4 billion , 'it will draw .
`` This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn . ''
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started , the 4 billion for the budget 2014 to note .
This measure , whose 4 promised billion we will be able to seek , is in danger of a right , parliamentary discussion .

Twitter carefully cheshire-berufung power
Half a dozen of you tippten in the riots in the courtroom way .
In the minutentakt verschickten you on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies .
In the end , so the defence , there have been more than 140 , 000 twitter-meldungen on the process to rape and beds gekettete children in a House that go up in flames .
On Thursday will be closely followed the process of Steven J. Hayes , was accused of , three members of a family in Cheshire , Connecticut , killed , to have a formal end to find , if the verdict has been reached on the death sentence that the selection panel , has made .
But Mr Hayes lawyers have already tabled amendments in court , the reasons for appeal to explain and the courts in years to come .
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it by the intensive reporting on the process , even by the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a `` zirkusatmosphäre 'and a as widespread , instant penetration aufrührerischer details have been , so that the jury illegally , influenced by the public indignation .
This protest could persuade the appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies , new rules in the courtroom necessary .
'as I have seen it during this process , I believe that it really is a danger , if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom every individual `` s right to a fair trial influenced , `` said Thomas J. Ullman , Mr. Hayes hauptverteidiger .
The presiding judge , Jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht , last week the applications by Decision back briefly and when he said that the new media `` carefully controlled ' , and that there would be no evidence that the jury of passions driven .
But that certainly was not the last word on this matter .
For decades gerichtseinsprüche stated that the reporting of famous cases doubts as to the fairness of a process gives rise .
In its historic decision of 1996 , the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr Sam sheppard , a osteopaths from Cleveland , of his wife is to have killed , lifted and said in its decision that , given the new media a `` karnevalsatmosphäre in Court ' .
Some people believe that the television programme and the spielfilm `` on the flight 'in this crime is based .
Some lawyers say , gerichtseinsprüche what Mr. Hayes condemnation half a century later , could follow the argument that new rules are necessary , the channels of communication from the courtroom , the time of the if Dr sheppard were inconceivable to rules .
`` There is a good reason , about the impact of the new media in processes of a broad public , are to be concerned , '' said John J. donohue III , professor at Stanford law school , of the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated . His report , will they arbitrarily imposed .
Professor donohue said , some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of instant communications from the courtroom could out the processes of fair .
The twitter-angelegenheit is only one of many , the lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain in years to discuss , and therefore a condemnation to delay .
The defenders claim , for example , that Mr Hayes these could already have been as judge blue you had not allowed the reactions of potential judges to test , by offering them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed .
Some of the judges have said , photos of the victims , Jennifer hawke-petit , 48 years , and their tüchter , hayley , 17 years , and Michaela , 11 years , they would have met with horror .
The defenders say you were also the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution in question , and argue that the judge mistakenly have exchanged a jury , of a critic of the public prosecutor 's office , and that he would have been unacceptable pressure on the verdict , as he would have exercised the unusual decision was made , the selection panel on the weekend freely .
The judges were not isolated .
But their arguments on the influence of the detailed reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest .
In a urteilsanfechtung , which you have tabled last month , it notes that the case of the news in Connecticut had dominated and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate has been discussed by the candidate countries .
They argued that the new media continually the flames of the emotions have reopened on the case .
'such a daily crush of medienpiepser , cameras and reporters outside the courtroom , `` wrote the lawyers , '' it has previously in new haven and perhaps even nationally , not yet. ``
Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial .
In interviews said some journalists that the claim that these direct news are rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist , the more slowly than reports will be reimbursed , a technikfeindlicher view is that the report on future processes verarme .
But some lawyers said , would appelationsgerichte often faced with the argument , social and technical changes requires the adaptation through the courts .
Mr. hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion .
In your objection they were based on the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966 , in which the condemnation of Dr sheppard because of the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new media require new rules .
'this case , `` wrote you , ' represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century . ''

Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced
In a weak pointed betonierten klassenraum with dirty and abblätternden walls , the director of the anlong veng high school to the man who , it has built to the later , the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok alone .
'everyone here loves Ta Mok. ``
`` It was a good leader and he has focussed its people , '' said sreng KOR Ma , 42 years .
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as `` the schlachter ' , remains the commander in this remote former Khmer rouge-hochburg in the north-west Cambodia 's popular , where he hospitals and bridges built , the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live .
But this year , 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge to the government , are longstanding supporters in anlong challenged veng .
In April , a local truth and versöhnungsforum the victims the public confrontation with the people once the regime .
In June , the government has circulated a passed official examinations , that for the first time children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge are told .
And in July , a gemeinschaftstribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia , for the first time , a former Member of the Khmer Rouge , than the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centres , Kaing khek iev , better known as Duch , condemned to 35 years in prison .
With each of these developments , the fear amongst the Khmer Rouge veterans alnlong vengs , aggravated their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia .
'There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge , but they have no power to do anything , `` said chhang youk , the head of the documentation centre of Cambodia 's , an independent organisation that the regime .
'for them , life under the Khmer Rouge impressive , but the regime is a symbol of evil. ``
`` It divides even families . ''
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia , between 1975 and 1979 , an estimated 1.7 million people have been executed or they died of diseases , revision or from hunger .
When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979 the pole pot-ied Government underwent fled the leftovers of the regime and its armed forces on the border of Cambodia to Thailand .
This widespread you until December 1998 , when the last movement kapitulierte , mixed reactions .
As Pol Pot , Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerrilla warfare of its basis in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia , withdrew Ta Mok led the next generation in anlong veng .
But in the mid-1990 's , as a by the UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 to the first democratic elections , led the country 's large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters , to the government , which urged to the kapitulationen of Ieng Sary 1996 and nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998 .
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998 , and be Ta Mok alone , the , was not given in 1999 of government in the dangrek mountain arrested .
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh , where he was waiting for to his process .
As their benefactors they are no longer protected , the majority of former Khmer Rouge fighters in the exhausting poverty of the rural of Cambodia and many retained the movement in nostalgia memory .
Even if a few elite official of the Khmer Rouge their local regierungsposten retained their weapons , because they were niederlegten , the poor , uneducated farmers .
`` these people have only very little of the capitulation , '' said Sok leang benefited from the centre for justice and reconciliation , the in Cambodia , also in anlong veng , public forums does
'You are laid down in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime ' .
`` they grew without any berufswissen . ''
Sor Lim , 55 years , in 1974 , a teenager , the rhmer Rouge had joined , fought in the jungle to anlang veng before he niederließ in 1998 , to live as poor reisbauer .
`` life under the Khmer Rouge was good , '' he said .
`` Ta Mok has any something to eat . ''
`` but now is the life difficult , because we are looking after our own . ''
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raises concerns .
At the beginning of next year , the Court will try Nuon Chea , Khieu Samphan , Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng thirith , another former Khmer Rouge Minister , brought to justice .
It is the task of the Court , the old leaders and those who are responsible for the atrocities , to condemn , but it is not said , whether it be through these four cases will pursue further action .
This has done little to the fears in anlong veng .
Current media speculation have agreed on in the chaem , 64 years , is concentrated , the during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970 's , in the province of distriktchefin manteay meanchey .
In 2007 , they envoy of the documentation centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of the trapeang thma dam , a project in which thousands of zwangsarbeitern probably died .
On a hot night in chaem came from the work in the fields on her holzhaus in a dirty street outside of anlong veng back .
As the sun long shadow on the desiccated grass in chaem accused rejected it , about their past in the Khmer Rouge to discuss .
The Court should they vorladen , it would refuse to go , she said .
'Cambodia lives in peace and stability , `` said it .
`` There would be no persecution more , would be war . ''
Prime Minister Hun Sen , the 1878 of the Khmer Rouge has fled , has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe , would the Court more suspicious charges , even though experts and historians to discuss this .
'Cambodia must dig a hole and disregard the past , `` he said .
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do in order to be able to go forward , said the dokumentationszentrum chhang youk .
`` reconciliation with the khmer-zeiten means build-up of the broken pieces , '' he said .
`` It is our duty , these broken parts together , so that everything can understand . ''
The Centre has created the first of the government approved passed official examinations on the Khmer Rouge , the 75seitige `` history of the democratic Cambodia ' .
It has circulated the book in June in anlong veng as an annex to the history books for the high school of the Ministry of Education , the less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge .
As so often in Cambodia know the young people in anlong veng little about the Khmer Rouge , despite the links of the city to the regime .
Touch valeak , 19 years , a student of the anlong veng high school , said that the new passed official examinations students helps , an important part of its history to understand .
But his parents , as he responded sceptical about the book with home , to it to read .
`` My family rejected many parts of the book and the Court from , '' he said .
'You are suspicious , because they are not sure how many people from the Court be condemned. ``
Such a resistance makes the process of reconciliation is complex and complicated , said Sok leang .
But the public forums , the passed official examinations and the Court and gain influence , `` he said .
Still has the Khmer Rouge here a powerful attraction .
The top in the dangrek mountains leads a of sträuchern überwucherter and with plastikmüll verdreckter way to a rechteck of black soot , with a rostigen blechdach covered .
Pol Pot 's body was here after his death on a reifenhaufen 1998 have been burnt .
Nuom sothea , 31 years , a handyverkäuferin on the roadside , said that it does not know much about the man who was here to have been burnt .
'But he has a strong spirit and many people here to him to go to pray ' she said .
It was nuom sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to go to Pol Pot 's final resting place , where they will give a Bush mature bananas - in the hope that he their luck .

Amazon freezes servers - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble .
The internet-dienstleister Amazon has the enthüllungsplattform of his servers exiled .
There is perhaps political pressure for the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomaten-depeschen .
WikiLeaks founder Assange is supposedly in England .
The enthüllungsplattform WikiLeaks equipment in the United States increasingly under attack .
The internet-aktivisten lost access to its previous American server and are now seeking a internet-heimat in Europe .
The prominent American Senator Joe , Avigdor Lieberman , called , however , other countries and companies to boycott of WikiLeaks .
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on the fahndungslisten by Interpol , should stop after a press report in the United Kingdom .
`` WikiLeaks of amazon-server . ''
'free speech in the land of the free , `` shared the enthüllungs-aktivisten by kurznachrichtendienst Twitter on Wednesday ( local time ) with .
Shortly before the dot.com companies had the Amazon wikileaks-dokumente of his servers exiled .
The internet-aktivisten had in the publication of the secret diplomatic depeschen on the Amazon web service ( AWS ) , the high zugriffszahlen on the documents .
By Twitter WikiLeaks declared to the step further : 'fine - our dollar will now be spent on people in Europe. ``
If Amazon such problem with the speech , `` should stop to sell books ' .
The use of its server Amazon have stopped by WikiLeaks after staff of Senator Joe , Avigdor Lieberman , investigations , the television station CNN reported in reference to the office liebermans .
The chairman of the Amazon senatsausschusses of homeland security was threatened with a boycott , told the British 'Guardian ' .
`` I would have liked Amazon sooner is taking this measure in view of the previous publications klassifizierter information by WikiLeaks ' , said the senator .
Meanwhile , Avigdor Lieberman , called for the platform in other countries to deny the use for servers .
`` WikiLeaks ' illegal , hideous and ruthless approach , our national security at risk and threat around the globe life ' , it means in a communication of the other independents senator .
`` not a responsible companies - whether American or foreign -- matter WikiLeaks in his efforts - should help to spread stolen material . ''
WikiLeaks founder Assange , because vergewaltigungsverdachts sought by the authorities in Sweden , is on the fahndungsliste of Interpol .
According to a report of the London newspaper 'the independent `` is the 39-year-old Australians in Great Britain , the exact location is Scotland Yard known .
The internet-aktivist the investigations in Sweden has always described as a set-up of its opponents .
Wikileaks-sprecher kristinn hrafnsson said in London , there have been threats .
`` There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange . ''
That is why Assange rightly fear its security , said hrafnsson .
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide .
Obviously hrafnsson responded on statements from North America .
In America , the previous Republican governor of Arkansas , Mike Huckabee , demanded that the person responsible for the wikileaks-enthüllungen indicted for treason and should be executed .
In Canada said a consultant of head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - on television , Assange 'should be killed `` and '' Obama could use a drone. ``
Between the White House and Assange today in the meantime , a battle .
The speaker of the US president , Barack Obama , Robert Gibbs , called it `` ridiculous and absurd '' that Assange the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , if you had asked for recently estimated spionage-aufforderungen to diplomats is responsible .
'I am not quite sure why we are about the opinion of a types with a website , `` Gibbs care .
`` our foreign policy and the interests of that country are far more important than its a website . ''
The American Government is now the protection of their databases fully to the test .
As the special envoy is the vize-direktor of the Centre for measures to combat terrorism , Russell Travers , has been appointed , informed the White House with .
Travers is responsible for this , `` the necessary structural reforms ' develop , the following the publication of the botschaftsberichte by WikiLeaks necessary .
The White House will also want to check the way , as the entire government information and protection .
Moreover , the American Government announced , for the safety of dissidents and most active , to by the wikileaks-veröffentlichung , they should be in jeopardy .
`` We have done everything to contact with them , '' said außenamtssprecher Philip Crowley .
'We stand ready to protect them , if that should be necessary ' .

Grammy-nominierungen : the jazz-sängerin esperanza Spalding , surprisingly , was in the category newcomers of the year excellent
If you at the request of a President auftritts , people will say it .
President Obama himself asked esperanza Spalding , at the ceremony on the occasion of the Nobel 2009 . Now it has been the 26-jährige jazz-bassistin and singer überrachsenderweise for this year 's grammy in category newcomers of the year nominated .
In view of the fact that , since their Spalding album `` esperanza '2008 in the jazz-szene already a gefeierter star , the nomination is a little unusual . But it is consistent with the grammy-regeln , under which a artists before publication of the albums with which he has been in the public at large , at most three albums by issued .
The ambitious album from the year 2010 , `` Chamber music society , '' is certainly a step forward . And with their beschwingten voice and a good sense of POPs , Funk and Latin music , we can calmly Spalding compare Norah Jones 2003 , whose great success in the year 2003 as the jazz-interpretin in this category of nomination spaldings .
In addition , this album `` historicity 'of the Vijay iyer trio in category instrumentalalben nominated . This the darling of the critics , this has been an enormous success .
To the competitors iyers include , `` Moody 5b '' of experienced saxophonisten James Moody and `` positootly 'of the keyboarders John Beasley .
Trombone shorty , a raubeiniger favourite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOS `` treme ' , has been in the category of contemporary jazz excellent , in the otherwise somewhat albums by of Stanley Clarke , John mcloughlin Jeff lorber and are to be found .
The secret societ of wild steampunk-musikers darcy James argue received in the category großgruppe well deserved attention . He is , therefore , against the Billy Childs emsemble with his kammer-jazz and the abenteuerlustigen Dave Holland and his oktett , whose life-ablum `` Merseyside pathways ' a good example of a bassisten than democratic bandleader is .

Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies
The affaire Wikileaks has a twofold importance .
On one side , it has than obvious scandal arrangement , a scandal , the only a scandal in the sinner hypocrisy is the beziehunge between the States , the citizens and the press governed .
On the other hand , it announces profound changes at international level , and gives us a taste of the future dominated by recession .
Let us get things in the right .
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of a secret service drafted acts ( a mere nation ) exclusively from zeitungsausschnitten .
The `` extraordinary , '' American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi 's are nothing more than what you in any case for months in any old Journal was to read ( except for those whose owners Berlusconi is ) , and the frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafi `` s kabarettkünstlern already provided for a long time for their sketche substance .
The rule that the secret dossiers only from already known news consist , is essential for the dynamism of the secret services , and not only this century .
If you go into a library , esotherischen publications , you will recognise that each work ( on the grail , the mystery of rennes-le-chateau , the templer or the rosenkreuzler ) exactly the repeated what was written already in previous works .
This does not only , therefore , that the author occult texts to publish any research ( yet , therefore , that he does not know where news about the nicht-existierende to ) , but because those who devote the okkultismus , to nothing other than the to believe what you already know and confirmed what you have already learned .
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus of Dan Brown .
Just as the secret files .
The informer is lazy , and lazy ( or limited spirit ) is also the head of the secret service ( otherwise what it could be , for example , editor in Libération ) , the only true considers what he recognises .
The top-secret information on Berlusconi , the American embassy in Rome , the staatsdezernat had sent , were the same as those who already Newsweek had published the week before .
So why was such a fuss about the revelation of this dossier ?
On one side is this what any educated person already know , that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the Heads of Government can call each other or a plane , to the dinner to meeting - have lost their diplomatic role , and , with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben , have turned in spionagezentren .
Any old viewers of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well , and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore this .
Nevertheless , the fact , to repeat it publicly violates the task of the hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light .
In second place : the idea that a x-beliebiger hackers the geheimsten secrets of the most powerful country in the world can tap , brings with it the significant blow against the prestige of the staatsdezernats .
In addition , the scandal less the victims , rather than the 'Executioner ' is in trouble .
But we have the profound nature of what has happened .
Formerly , to Orwell 's time , it was all power as a big brother , the every gesture of his subjects controlled .
Orwell 's prediction would have since then as absolutely right can highlight , where every movement thanks to the telephone calls can monitor any made transaction , the hotel , visited the elected motorway and so on ; the citizens to the total victims would the eye of power .
But if we , bearing in mind what is happening today , that even the secret krypten the power not more of the control of a hackers can escape the kontrollgang , it is said to be directed at , unilaterally and will zirkelförmig .
The power controlled every citizen , but every citizen , or at least the hackers - acquired as vindicator of the citizen - can the secrets of power in experience .
How can but a power that are no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets ?
It is true , Mr simmel has already said that a real secret an empty secret is ( and an empty secret can never be revealed ) ; it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi 's or Merkel 's , in fact , a secret free of geheimis is , since it surrenders the public sphere ; but , in the manner of WikiLeaks be disclosed that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets , means to deprive them of any power .
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy still Merkel wrong , against it but Clinton and Obama .
What are the consequences of this violation , such a huge power has been done ?
It is obvious that the States in future no reserved more online information - that would be a in the street corner angeklebten aushang .
But it is equally obvious that it with the current technologies in vain hope is , confidential reports on telephone able to keep secret .
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State in a plane moved and one of his colleagues has contacted .
How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relations are ?
I know very well that my forecast in the moment following science fiction and romanhaft sounds , but I am forced , me to present the regierungsagenten on secret way digging away to uncontrollable marschrouten moving , their communications than anywhere else in the mere memories tragend with it , and , moreover , the few written information , they have achieved , in the schuhabsatz verbergend .
The information would be in one single copy in closed can not be stored : in fact , had the spionageversuch of Watergate less success , as WikiLeaks .
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today as a cancer is moving ahead , namely backwards .
A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionized the communications , the Internet a telegrafen reconstructed with ( telephone ) wire .
The ( analogue ) videokassetten had the filmforschern possible , a film bond for bond auszukundschaften by from behind forward spulen and all the secrets of installation was able to reveal , while the ( numerical ) CDS nowadays , nothing other than from chapter to chapter to jump in makroportionen so .
With the high-speed trains , one in three hours from Rome to Milan , while this by air , including of switching three and a half hours requires .
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communications technology on car and horse .
A final observation .
In earlier times tried to understand what the press for secrets forged between the embassies .
At present , it is the messages that confidential information from the press .

Europeans thinking on the strengthening of the antikrisenmaßnahmen after
Christine Lagarde , it had even yesterday in a press conference in Paris explicitly stated : `` I believe that it is still on Sunday afternoon , and also in the evening , clearly demonstrated : the Europeans keep together , are ready and committed , their currency and to defend its currency area ' .
Although completely relatively - the yesterday , withdrawal in the zinsfüßen the European staatsobligationen was grist to the mill of the governments and of the ECB .
From a normalisierungsbeginn can , however , not yet .
The rating agency Standard & Poor 's had announced that it could the schuldenvermerk Portugal , perhaps the most effective target of the speculators , lower today .
`` as in May , there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility , particularly on the banking systems rests , '' the opinion of the economists of the exane BNP Paribas .
Above all , especially as ' the political time passes much more slowly than the of the markets ' .
The European countries , both this gap and the risk that it is hidden , intensify , are well aware of the discussions on the strengthening of the already existing antikrisenmaßnahmen .
The informal discussions between the closest affected Finance Ministers and in the broader context , with their opposite numbers of the G20 is progressing well .
And this also in regard to the meetings of eurogroupe and ECOFIN at the beginning of next week .
The ECB is today .
In the plan is the lot of non-conventional measures to save the countries of the euro area in the bulls eye of the markets ( see below ) .
What the eu-stabilitätsfonds is concerned , it has its executive director Klaus Regling already on Tuesday in singapour his asien-tour started the investors in the Far East on the developments with regard to the crisis in Europe .
If the aim of his visit not express fundraising , he is certainly this to the ground .
The first werpapierausgaben from the eu-stabilitätsfonds are scheduled for next month .
Yesterday , an official American representative of the agency Reuters entrusted to the United States supported a possible increase in the by the additional , direct commitment of the IMF mobilized fund .
Portugal and Spain , the countries in the first series , send , for their part , structural reforms , particularly in the area of arbeitsmarktorganisation .
Reforms that are added to the austerity measures , however , show effects in the near future .
Lisbon and Madrid , a different approach , as this Greece and Ireland have done .
Both , and the other is at any price , to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they set their own budgetkorrektive and on essential structural reforms , which you have decided , in the long term , the confidence again .
The European investors , in their turn , have been on the options available to the normalisation process to speed up the markets of government bonds .
President Axel Weber , on 24 November in Paris in transit , was produced as a first had the idea that if the 750 by Europe and the International Monetary Fund mobilized billion euros were not enough , the Union would not hesitate , once again into their own pockets .
The economists of Barclays Capital , in terms of the market of the European public debt in the forefront of related player , judgments , an extension of the EUR 100 billion would be enough , `` preferably '' in the form of a direct massive injection of liquidity .
This means exist : the European mechanism dotierter finanzstabilisierung currently is EUR 60 billion .
An advisory committee , all the opportunities , closely in the European capitals examining .
Above all , if the market conditions worse .

The Berlusconi government is in Italy in cover
After a for Italy worrying of the week , the situation has yesterday with the decline in the eckzinsen a little to 10 years .
A return to the deceptive silence .
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs had the regionsvorsitzenden Giulio Tremonti the situation as ' and 'unentzifferbar qualify him with a ' unvorhersagbaren `` weekend will have to hear what the person concerned was denied by immediately , however .
On Tuesday , in any case , would have the gap with the German interest rates achieved its record of 210 basis points , and the prices of the Treaties to cover the konkursrisikos points are to 263 , what a certain kopflosigkeit generated in Rome .
Silvio Berlusconi had in its Council of Ministers pointed out , that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates in 400 basis points .
His right hand , MEP , Mr Letta , was , however , difficult as ' concerned 'of the ' market turbulence 'and a possible risk of infection from Ireland .
'The good news is that Italy , the third economy of the euro area , not as Greece or Ireland. ``
`` The bad news is that Italy , as Portugal is , '' declared stelzer Irwin , economist on the Hudson institutes .
In plain language , the heisst his problem is the absenz of economic growth and the attendant , schwindsüchtigen steuereingänge , which the state in danger , its financing needs no longer able to meet .
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government .
In the future , an Italian growth of 1.1 % in 2011 and of 1.4 % in 2012 ... although expected from the Senate is examining the budget with 1.3 % and 2 % is calculated .
Under these conditions , the European Commission will be calculated , next year 's budget deficit still 4.3 % of GDP ( contrary to the predicted by the governments 3.9 % ) and 3.5 % in 2012 ( rather than 2.7 % ) .
That is why the turmoil at a new haushaltskollektiv , that after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used .
`` if necessary , new austerity measures must be taken , '' says Auditors Olli Rehn .
Italy to hour receives the support of international institutions .
'undermines the very foundations of Italy 's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated , repeat that we already have for a long time , `` assured arrigo sadun , Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund , the IMF is entrusted with Italy .
`` at the moment there is no problems , not on short-term , still on long-term view , because of Italy , despite its high debt ( 119,2 % of GDP in the year 2011 , other things that R. ) will be asked for lower stabilisationsfortschritte than of other countries ' , observed Pier Carlo padoan , chef-volkswirt of the OECD .
There remains the question of the political unstetigkeit .
On 14 December will be Silvio Berlusconi , a motion of censure of the Chamber of Deputies , face as a result of which the preferred elections at the end of March could be organised .
It is therefore a little favourable period , for a decision on a serious crisis .

Can combine courtesy that divides us ?
After a campaign to schimpfwörtern and negativity is this week little courtesy in Washington has erupted .
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion , before we quickly to the fight of the parties in the capital return ?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and levels of the Congress produced no breakthrough in the major issues , be dealt with during the so-called `` lame duck '' session , the meeting at the end of a government 's policy , in which no more decisions are taken .
After all the accounts , it was neither a polite debate between two different sides still a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern , but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns .
The public meetings of the deficit Commission of the President on Wednesday was also civilized , despite the political differences between the members continue to exist .
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months can give a mutual respect , of the ideological divide that continue to the Members divides , hushed up .
It is not enough to say that it was a new era of cooperation here .
Both sides are now in a test phase - in the one from the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise , while claiming even tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed parteienkriegsführung arbitration .
This was why the meeting on Tuesday itself , and its assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited .
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to be a rapid change the atmosphere in the last two years , which prevailed might expect .
Regardless of whether it with taxes , donations , health or benefits is that the two sides are miles away from each other .
Lastly , the novemberwahl Washington , at least for a short time bribed .
'No question , the tone has changed , `` said pete wehner , an official representatives of the Bush administration , the now for the ' ethics and public policy center '' works .
`` that is after elections inevitable .
Elections give partisan passions that die again .
And that is a good thing. ``
In some issues , particularly in those that are on the agenda of the `` lame duck '' session are Republicans and Democrats , have no other choice than to find a solution. ``
Bush 's tax cuts to an end at the end of the year , and no one is in favour of that .
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all , whether it is temporarily or permanently .
Similarly , a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to expect , if only because the Republicans can not afford that people think that the recommendation that tax cuts for the rich , while they refuse to unemployed workers a support .
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the optimism has risen , that it is in these issues during the `` lame duck session 'some and also , at the same time , the New START Treaty , can not ratify .
But William glaston of the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck session 'does not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead , if the new 112 . Congress in January will convene .
Instead , he says , is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens more likely , perhaps even inevitable .
`` after the things that have to be done is done , will turn this short-term psychology in confrontation , '' he said .
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many , the courtesy to real cooperation .
`` I see much of what is happening today in by 2012 , as vorkampf , or further shadow boxing , for the hauptereignis from 2012 , '' he said .
The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House , and to do it with the teeparty-wählern who were instrumental in their education .
How worried about the Republican leaders also may be that they too high poker , you know that you have to try their promise to reduce the expenditure of the government and health-care reform , to be adhered to .
These parteilinien are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clear how a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes , as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of government spending .
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have adopted , in accordance with their own assessment , so very pressed the defizitfrage on the public agenda that these could no longer be ignored .
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to its plan to official recommendation and to make you fight very even in the vicinity of this number .
The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body , as in financial matters , today at least , little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises .
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress .
The first fight will next year in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place , if the Republicans Obama in terms of the budget , the taxes and of the health system , then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation .
What will lead to this change ?
Public opinion .
It has been proved that , despite the partiality of the current election , the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together .
If confrontation leads to a dead end , as has happened in 1995 , then both sides must carefully on the public reaction .
Whoever is condemned to lose , will change the course and the compromise must seek .
This may in fact be an optimistic view .
Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the middle of the 1990 's , and they seem a more ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans .
At the same time , the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far wider choice of consistency 2012 .
So it may be the courtesy , the this week for the display of many Americans , will be welcomed .
But it will on both sides very much more effort , require a common denominator in the questions , the two still separated .

The airline qantas now wishes to sue the motorenhersteller .
The passengers of the notgelandeten qantas-airbus had at the beginning of November appears to be much more luck than has so far been known : the Australian aviation safety authority in their investigation has a major security problem in the engines of some a380-maschinen noted - and now warns against a possible baufehler .
The potential defect would have serious consequences : in one ölschlauchverbindung he could produce ermüdungsrisse and leaks , it was said in a statement published on this Thursday , the authority atsb .

'with your voice that we are waiting for , the time has come to listen to you , `` he said .
The news has been disseminated , after the 42 Republican Senators androhten , all vote for every law to block , except the extension of the reductions from the times of Bush and the funding of the government would be extended .
Such a blockade on a of the 42 Republican Senators signed letter was announced , could amount to the vote of the dream act - law and other projects , such as the ratification of the new start-abkommens with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
On the blockade of the Republicans of the law dream act and other projects , said the consulted präsidentschaftssprecher Robert Gibbs , he trust that , once the steuerthema resolved , a timetable for the other projects could be drawn up .
`` I believe that we still have a lot of time ... ''
`` all , we agree with the steuerangelegenheit must be carried out before the end of the year ... ''
'I believe that we can make an agreement at any time , and then we can plan the expiry of the remainder , `` he said .
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate , Harry Reid , kündete on Tuesday , `` he would the vote at the end of the debate 'request , so that the dream act - law with which the legalisation initiative undokumentierter students from next Thursday in the Senate , could be put to the vote , even though the next week would be more likely .
The version of the dream act - law or the law of the American dream would roughly 800 000 young people who , in the United States , as you do not yet immigrated sixteen years old , were during the last five years in this country and have lived in a higher educational institution or in the army , legalise books are .
But the supporters of the law need to the approval of the initiative , which is why they sixty vote on the votes of a handful of Republicans . At the time , the organisations of the advocates of this project a strong influence on the adoption of the law .
The Democrats , of which the majority support the dream act , have 58 seats .
One of them , however , said , the Senator Ben Nelson from nebraska , he would vote against and only a Republican , Richard Lugar from Indiana , has announced its support of the law .

David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new justizkapitel in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies .
The founders of the largest holdings for business services seems not to be prepared , in his legal dispute to the control of the institutions of El enebro to give way .
From the board of which he was five of its seven children herausgetrieben . This appointed to the shareholders meeting of 18 January of this year , which has already been contested in the handelsregister is listed , to verwaltungsratsmitgliedern .

Arsen-resistente microbe could new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere , allow
The discovery of a foreign bakterienart which , amongst other things of arsenic can live , opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth , and elsewhere .
Although researchers this unusual bacillus here on earth , is it your view , a sign that a life without the hitherto regarded as vital elements is possible .
'This body has two options. ``
`` he needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic . ''
`` the power it to something very special , although it almost a form of 'foreign ' way of life is ' , said Paul c.w . Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report that on Thursday in the online-ausgabe the magazine Science .
So far , six main elements have been regarded as a vital - carbon , hydrogen and oxygen , phosphorus and nitrogen and sulphur .
But , as the scientists herausfanden , increases the Bacillus in the Californian mono Lake still further , if it phosphorus by arsenic replaced .
`` one wonders what else is still possible , '' said the co-autor of the report Ariel that Anbar of Arizona State University .
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life , as scientists life and its forms must recognise , so Anbar .
The study deals with microbes that on earth were found .
The announcement of a press conference , in which no details to the discovery of were announced , was a cause for widespread speculation on the Internet , that the report of the discovery of außerirdischen life might be .
This is not the case .
The discovery `` shows that in other planetensystemen organisms , with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente ' , which in our opinion are absolutely vital , not necessarily see given ' , said Charles cockell , Professor on planetary and space sciences research institute of open university of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom .
Cockel was not part of the research teams .
'This work is a new departure , because it shows that in basic biochemischen processes and structures one element can be replaced by another ' , added cockell .
This discovery was not accidental .
The wolfe-simon Felisa astrobiologischen Institute NASA , the study , chose the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts .
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically same , that microbes that both are exposed , possibly a element by the other can replace .
`` The , were aware of the arsens is based , in particular , that there is a chemically a similar situation as phosphorus . ''
`` by the organisms , find it difficult to distinguish an element from the other . ''
`` But the difference is so great that arsenic different acts as phosphorus . It has reached in our biochemisches system , where it almost everything , '' says verschmiert Anbar .
The researchers , the Bacillus gfaj-1 a rising arsenkonzentration . It suited to and grew .
The microbe is growing phosphorus better , but that it also in arsenic can survive , shows that a arsen-basierte way of life , of course , can happen , either on the earth or another planet or on the moon , arsenic more often occurs .
According to Jamie S. foster , dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida , is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic , not new . But so far there was still no functioning example .
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more common , she says , that is why the science assumed that early forms of life there have been used .
`` There is reason to believe that life can also have developed differently than in the early erdzeitalter , '' Forster , which was not a Member in wolfe-simons forschungsteam .
The research were from NASA and the Department of Energy and the national health authorities .

Belarus is in agreement with this , not further weapons-grade uranium accumulate
In a surprising victory for President Obama 's campaign to global security of nuclear material has the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium , which is a critical part of nuclear weapons .
The deal was in a common statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister , Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels made known .
For years , the US Government had tried to convince , Belarus , not more highly enriched uranium and seemed to collect last spring a hurdle to have achieved .
But official of the US administration told the Washington Post that in the last two months two secret agreement with Belarus have been taken 187 pound weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt .
This concerned the stage for the agreement on Wednesday , the rest of the material to remove - according to an official staff , because of the sensitivity of the issue of anonymous , approximately GBP 500 .
The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama 's `` nuclear summit on security of the 47 nations ' in April , the Belarus had excluded .
And it was obvious good enough , at the invitation of the former Soviet Republic of the next summit of 2012 .
'I was truly thrilled about the fact that it has a seat in the nuclear summit on security ( from 2012 ) want. ``
'This shows me that it works , `` said Ken luongo , President of the partnership global security , a group on the promotion of nuclear safety .
Clinton called the agreement `` a very significant and important step 'of Belarus .
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 , within four years to ensure all precarious nuclear material .
Since the US administration has helped six countries , their highly enriched uranium to get rid of .
Belarus will the seventh .
A dozen countries did it under the Government of George W. Bush .
In the time of Obama 's nuclear summit on security , the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never abandon their uranium .
'How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos , which is fundamentally waffenfähig , and less enriched uranium , `` said Lukashenko does at the time .
`` This is our raw material ... we will make no dirty bombs and we will sell it to anybody ' .
`` We use it solely for research purposes , that is all . ''
Belarus approached , however , a few months ago the United States when it interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte .
The first round of the uranium to remove Belarus in October , was particularly complicated , because the material easy verstrahlt was , say official .
It has been in a spezialzug load , of the more than 1 300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for , say official .
The second attempt was decided on Monday and has been carried out according to the official by plane .
The US government pays for this effort $ 14 million , with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with depleted uranium , which will not be used for nuclear weapons .
'this was extremely cautious , coordinated and to strengthen confidence , `` the to the agreement , which was signed by President Clinton , led , said Andrew bieniawski , a representative of the department , that in the global gefahrenreduzierung works .
The James Martin centre for nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus in this year at least 88 pound waffenfähhigen uranium had , as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium .
Belarus will be according to the common agreement camps by 2012 .
The relations between Belarus and the US for years been tense , primarily because of Lukashenko 's harsh disregard for human rights .
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement .
`` the progress of this global security issues welcome heißend , the United States of America and Belarus aware that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central theme in the improvement of the bilateral relations , and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens ' , it states .

To hell , warriors !
The kunstkino fits splatter ?
The director Nicolas winding refn is testing with his kämpfer-epos `` walhalla rising '' old genre-grenzen new .
To which Members of the public may of the Danish director Nicolas winding refn have thought , `` as he has turned walhalla rising '' ?
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye ( mads mikkelsen ) freed themselves from his peinigern and places with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents in order - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action , precisely because our hero thuggish tötungsmethoden like to serve and its enemies already time the gedärme from the vibrant , limb if he has bad humour .
On the other hand , as it is actually says einauge is mentioned , the whole film about not a word , and also the other characters can at most be time to one or two sentences , or a few painful todesschreien .
Otherwise , remained silent and in the gruselig fine hügellandschaft of Scotland , the the wikingerwelt geschwelgt from around a thousand years ago , the scene .
Ideal rather cineasten for adults with interest for existentialismus and very calm kamerafahrten .
Well , if a film has several target groups , it is a shame that , if they are mutually exclusive .
Director winding refn applies since its wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie `` pusher 'as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino , refuses but stoical , his works with a little more humour the mainstream or a little less brutality the arthouse accessible .
Most kunstkino-freunde are the around spritzenden gehirnmasse and the gedärmen put off .
At the latest the action-fans then die from boredom , if einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons , with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem aufbricht and an eternity in slump and fog , before the team seems trapped in America there is , and remains silent .
No wonder , then , that 'walhalla rising `` in Germany has found no kino-verleih and now only on DVD .
This is particularly because of the magnificent images be a shame , but also because , behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema , which deserves some attention .
In this film is not about dialogues or for a rigorous action , it is all atmosphere , a filmgewordener fiebertraum .
And from which there is no escape for the viewers .
Hardly refn off a moment of détente and undertakes him with his icy images and the dark trance-artigen 's throat soundtrack very slowly , but above all with the unspeakable hatred of him from the hearts of the characters runs .
Only a small blonder young , the einauge faithful to the side , preserves something like innocence , all the others will of anger .
The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero , whose motives , but never be declared for enemies and temporary allies at some point to the warriors from hell will , perhaps to the Ambassador of the devil itself .
It means ruin , but perhaps also only for the already verdorbenen .
`` walhalla rising '' is a more puzzling film you hate and admire , to annoy , upset and marvel at .
An experience .

The army has so many zündschnüre that we could keep the Czech Republic umwickeln but only two years
The Czech army has 445 kilometres zündschnüre bought with explosives , be released .
In the year before , the Defense Ministry already 224 kilometres to the armeelager powder .
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years have ausgesorgt .
The problem is only the shelf-life of zündschnüre - two , but no more than four years .
The army of the company bought the zündschnüre stv group , other things S. for a mere 40 million kroner .
In his explanatory statement for the procurement of this huge amount of powder replied the General Staff mf dnes , the soldiers would in a year , the 60 kilometres powder use .
According to the research of armeepyrotechnikern , the mf dnes point that came from this claim is that the whole army every year a very intensive pyrotechnic training should - of all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos , to the secretaries and Putzfrauen .
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general picek vlastimil not excluded .
Only in this way can the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified .
This length is also actually 25,000 detonationen .
But even so , would these armeebestände for more than ten years .
But if the old rule of experts is that for the training of each new professional two metres powder is quite sufficient , then the army by these neueinkäufe - even from the point of view of the increased needs of the key and special units - a reassuring supply for the above-mentioned 225 years .
It complained soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently in the Defense Minister Vondra , you would have almost no patronen for small arms register more so that , because of the lack of resources are severely restricted .
Not to mention the unterhosenmangel .
'me is also not why they buy such huge amounts of us zündschnüre. ``
But that is , ultimately , its decision , you will already be aware , to what you need ' .
`` for us is the army a good customer , which we , as traders to want to come as far as possible ' , says the vertriebsmanager the stv group Jan děcký .
Jan pejšek , the Department of Defense spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder , the army that would have been so for at least ten years with this `` ammunition '' heckle him .
Jan děcký of the stv group but talks only of a four-year gebrauchsdauer the zündschnüre and police and armeepyrotechniker even only of two years ago .
'With perfect storage are probably also the four mentioned years possible ' , one of them a , but wants to remain turns , not as a soldier accused the criticism of the army .
After the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer any munitions must be thoroughly tested , whether they are reliable and not the lives of the soldiers at risk .
These tests are but not for nothing , but cost money .
A further argument , Department of Defense is the mengenrabatt for the 445 kilometres powder .
`` They cost us 60 % less than the letztjährige supply of 244 kilometres , '' spokesman pejšek shares the view of the US Department of Defense einkäufer with .
Only by way of comparison , the annual consumption of zündschnüren of pyrotechnikern of the police , the ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet bruderarmee withdraw , exceeds some years already barely 1 500 metres .
And the police state , not always only such quantities of these munitions which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume .
The security of the pyrotechniker , furthermore , because they are so the possibility of flexible purchases more modern and thus also reliable zündschnüre open .
In any case , the Defense Ministry has huge problems in the winding-up of the tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty , when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak people `` s army continuously on their campaign on the Rhine prepared .
According to the pyrotechnikern mf dnes has raised , expected the Czech forces in a few years , the same problem in the winding up of hundreds of kilometres of old zündschnüre you today as `` good '' has bought .

Moscow us-dokument durchgesickertes portrayed as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the `` kleptocracy 'and you are a part of the bribes and of the schutzgeldes that you einsammelt , further to the Kremlin . As reported in February the American embassy in Russia in a memo .
Both police and blackmail the staatssicherheitsdienst high protection money so that they can keep expensive standard of living in Moscow , as it says .
They collect money not only of legitimate business , but also of organised criminal gangs .
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a `` vertical the authority '' - takes its part of the money that the head to the top .
The memo , which under the name of Ambassador John beyrle to Washington , was broadcast on Tuesday of WikiLeaks published on its website .
The memo is based on sources , whose names have been redigiert .
It was written , while still Moscow 's mayor Yuri Luzhkov was , and it accuses him of corruption .
He was in October of President Dmitry Medvedev fired , but there is little evidence that , in the meantime , would have been cleared up .
Luzhkov and his wife , Yelena baturina , a well-known construction company has over the years , have always rejected accusations of corruption , and he has won many verleumdungsklagen against such accusations .
In September , he declared a Russian TV stations , when he was asked for a documentation , which suggests that he is corrupt : `` It is crazy , it is bad way , it is dirty . ''
. An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt . The have surveys show .
But it is extraordinary that , as in the report of the ambassador , individuals are mentioned , and it is unheard , that this by a diplomats of a foreign country .
`` The direct link to the government of Moscow with the crime has led to some it as ' disrupted call 'and to the conclusion that the government is more like a kleptokrat as a government , '' the memo .
'criminal elements enjoy a `` kryshna '' ( a term from the world of criminal / the mafia , which literally `` roof '' or protection means ) on the police , the state security ( FSB ) , the dienstaufsichtsbehörde ( MVD ) and the office of the public prosecutor , as well as covered by the whole of the Moscow regierungsbürokratie .
Experts have a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow .
`` Luzhkov is paramount . ''
`` FSB and MVD , the militia are on the second stage . ''
'least consequences the ordinären criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom. ``
`` This is a inkompetentes system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap , because the city of no help . ''
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the largest firms from the police and the small business people arrested .
One source , that is to say , `` declared that Moscow shopkeepers understand that it is best , the protection of the FSB and MVD ( and not by organised crime ) , as they not only more weapons , resources and power than the criminals , but also because they are protected by law ' .
`` This is the reason why the protection by criminal gangs not more so asked as before ' .
The memo noted that , while the collection of the money is comprehensive , the protection itself very be modest no ; even the , the figures are sometimes arrested .
The who do not pay their business , find very quickly - on the basis of one or other vorwands .
Medvedev has spoken about this on several occasions , to fight corruption , but at the same time , has said that he has made very little progress .
The message the memo contains descriptions of men , the with with suitcases full of money , probably , in the Kremlin .
`` in his fight against corruption must Medvedev to leave the bureaucrats , '' said finds satarov , Director of by Moscow , a committee of experts , in a recent interview .
'But he is part of this bureaucracy. ``
`` It is not part of the political class , because a political class in Russia no longer exists . ''
Without politicians , without opposition , without a separation of powers , he says , corruption is inevitable .
Nationally , costs , as is estimated by the corruption Russia more than $ 300 billion per year .
The country is in place 154 a recent investigation into the global perception of the corruption by the non-governmental organisation transparence international ( countries will be of 'least corrupt `` to '' most corrupt ' ) .
The revelation of the memos the US Embassy in Moscow time evening , what happened , will certainly displeasure within the Russian Government , although , as Luzhkov for the mistakes of Moscow can be accused of , it for the Kremlin can also be a possibility to claim that it will resolve the problems .
In an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin claimed that the wikileaks-dokumente could be a counterfeiting and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Medvedev Robin mentioned .
`` The truth is that it is about our interaction , which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country is , '' he said .
`` But , to be quite honest , we would not have expected that this would happen with such arrogance , with a kind of pressure and to so unethical way know it . ''

Also the mitteldeutsche broadcasting ( mdr ) had recently human links between kontrollierender EU authority and industrial lobby , reveals what the umweltbundesamt , as EU parliamentarians sit up and take notice .
The EFSA can , however , see no conflict of interest .
We would reiterate to all serious data , even on those of the industry , as long as they are of high technical quality , it says in an opinion .
Of the experts , who work for EFSA , you do not demand that they have no contact with the industry .
They would need to disclose this , however .

This calls itself neutral forum of experts from science , industry and policy , among other things , the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag .
In the matter of independent experts criticise how then that genetically modified plants currently without any fütterungsversuch in animals be allowed and the reaction of crops to nurture , will not tested .

Current practice is only isolated proteins , but not the whole genpflanze to test how liefere no reliable results .
`` If the risks not addiction , how can we then find it ? 'asks then and point an accusing finger .
It also provides for Angelika hilbeck so .
The scientist parts since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently in the technical university Zurich .
The industry attempts in this area , as in the United States now also in Europe is becoming more and more , critical scientists to influence and to discredit .
There is therefore hardly researchers , not with groups are intertwined .
For businesses critical studies would not usually published .
`` The industry controls the security research , '' claims hilbeck .

Czech children with Fernet highest and rum , beer is out - it is simply too slow
Fernet , rum and vodka , just for once , also time a good whisky , which the father has stolen from the hausbar .
These are the beverages , for whose benefit from drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen most frequently notbehandelt .
No exception are children , the their hangovers ausschlafen must repeatedly in the hospital .
This is from the experience of doctors , with similar cases in the inclusion of the kinderabteilungen of clinics .
'beer or wine are completely out of fashion , because it is simply too long before you get. ``
`` Today 's trend is clearly of hard alcohol , '' said právo luděk Pelikán , the chefarzt the kinderabteilung in the mittelböhmischen clinic hořovice .
`` whisky , if it succeeds , the father of a bottle of hausbar to ours and , if not , then at least Fernet or vodka .
'vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice , then it smacks of not as strong , `` says the chefarzt .
The speaker of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová gives him right .
`` the most , it is about Fernet or rum . ''
`` This is today 's alkoholtrend , especially at primary school . ''
`` occasionally it was also about slibowitz , we feel at home ' , led Mrs jurinová .
According to Pelikán chefarzt dreizehn- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme long fairly common .
Before the clinic in hořovice , on which he is working , since this year , he was ten years in the pädiatrie-abteilung motol the hospital , where the ambulances angetrunkene ablieferten pupils from far and wide .
'A girl had to be four times hospitalisiert. ``
`` You began their careers with 12 years ago , when the first time it with 3.5 mg alcohol in the blood and even in combination with '' extase `` was , '' described the doctor was a particularly serious case .
`` It was in ausstellungsgelände in holešovice on any tanzparty . ''
`` The interesting in that it was not at all strange , taking their mother , that your daughter 48 hours not came home ' , is the chefarzt .
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance at the start with the own sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children .
A real dependence in the true sense of the word , is it not , according to experts , in children .
`` under alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case in these children . ''
With those who enjoy repeatedly alcohol , is often a negative familiär-sozialer background characteristic , `` says chefarzt Pelikán .
The speaker of the hospital motol , according to Mrs jurinová were until the middle of November around forty drunken children in the abandonment of department for child and jugendmedizin trained .
However , only the cases with serious alkoholvergiftung , the one in hospital was needed , go in the statistics .
Drunken children , the following ambulatory care of the parents of the police or , if necessary , be brought home , are not registered .
Apart from the cases in which children only times as a bottle of spirits in the schulbank austrinken are there in the opinion of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche amplituden , to the 100 % is good : walpurgisnacht , New Year 's Eve of and the end of the school year .
`` the latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the poor testimony to or from joy on the holiday . ''
'in the walpurgisnacht I have already seven drunken children at once experienced in the opening , `` stresses Dr Pelikán .
A betrunkenes child that the night under medical supervision spends , paradoxically , is better off , as a child , the next day , only with a nasty hangover .
The headaches on the morning after that , the of the dehydration and the glukosemangel , can be in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glucose produced and nutrients , the absence of the organism .
`` clearly they are better off , because according to the '' beautiful 'experience in the evening , raise it with good humour , without that somewhere something ache. ``
`` You are only a little confused as to where they are ' , Dr Pelikán , recognising the patients sometimes at least the good humour in similar vein , by giving you the cost of that year , you who treatment will cost .
Because of the transport with the ambulances and the night in a akutbett well and like to come to a few tens of thousands of kronor .
`` now and again I have used this as erziehungsmittel , if I directly to the children in the visit have meant , which has cost their Drunkenness and that it can happen that you time the whole holidays on must work to make the money for a single such fete to earn , '' added Dr Pelikán .
In his view , the health insurance funds , however , not after regressverfahren , in order to cure the trunkenen children necessary costs of the parents .

For the takeover of excentris staatsanleihe
The quebecer government by the Société Angus and the companies parallèle was called upon to do it , funding of the adoption of the kinokomplexes excentris to take part , with a cooperation agreement , but only in the form of a competitive borrowing .
The entwicklergesellschaft Angus parallèle , as well as the companies , which are a donation of EUR 7 million dollars by the kultusministerium for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois excentris kinokomplexes belonging to the Boulevard saint-laurent had hoped , this again to entrust its actual cineastischen function , clearly not what they have asked .
The government has accepted , in this case , however , to involve to their own conditions .
Instead of the expected donation provides the quebecer government rather a loan in less than the amount which initially hoped for a viable solution to the advantageous conditions could , at least according to the state scaremongers entnehmbaren sources .
A first action plan , as well as a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring , which was once again bittgesuch since the overall downwards .
A proposal , together with an action plan have already been expressed by the President of the `` Société de Développement des Entreprises culturelles '' ( sodec ) , François macerola , to Minister st-pierre , which the acts excentris .
A few days ago , he had her a last technical report .
The counter-proposal of cabinet was the sodec , however , on Wednesday .
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December , at this time to reply .
In any case , it seems that the premise of the staatsspende really to have been pushed aside .
Let us remember that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft cinemas and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition to support the adoption of excentris had revolted by the argument invoked , the Culture Ministers have no financial aid for immobilienprojekte there to do it not also have other cinema .
Several other market participants of the light , there , on the contrary , the substantial , economic assistance .
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had the eigenfinanzierten construction of the cinema over ten years the autorenkino with great difficulty in the premises of his kinokomplexes , what the unique position on the part of the public treasury .
The lack of cinema , the independent films in Montreal , is more than obvious , and excentris was aware of his clients to keep .
The Société Angus and the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini at the top , taxes , for its part , a privately financed campagne , of which it is a sum 700 000 $ hope for the acquisition , in order to stimulate .
Since the spring of 2009 is only one screen so that continue to show in excentris , films , namely Le parallèle .
The aim of the future acquirer is it , the three kinosäle on 27 February of next year with the demonstration of the very successful film of Xavier beauvois ' of the hommes et des dieux 'new .
Christian yaccarini but has the newspaper 'Le devoir `` not removed , and it ignores what he and his group of the corrected downwards , we believe that the proposals you have made .

Red Bull prevails in the F1 with a geheimwaffe of Siemens
The car will be improved with a software in real time .
Since Red Bull in 2004 in the world of Formula 1 eindrang , is your history in this splendid universe of the speed of surprises and successes .
Initially , no one paid attention to the newcomer and , despite its steeply rising background during the last seasons , all in the final sprint last November to the victory of the Ferrari 's by Fernando Alonso .
Without the capabilities of the German pilots and weltmeisters Sebastian vettel or the leistungsstärke of the motors of Renault going to reduce want is the `` geheimwaffe '' that the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands , and thus a siegerteam created , on the legend .
In reality is a powerful software to simulate of processes which the German company 2007 to purposes , which do not have to do with motor race , on the market brought .
This as plm informatikprogramm was called for the development of montageketten in factories throughout the world , energiewerken and precise instruments used .
The goal is an exact reproduction or simulation of a product or process , before this , indeed , is being built , so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs .
Plm , the development of the cameras of canon , the aircraft of Sukhoi and of the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan easier .
Siegfried russwurm , head of the industrieabteilung of Siemens , declared that the use of these software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull 'in a few hours , almost in real time , `` the changes and improvements to the race and with the tests are discovered , draw up and can carry out .
Russwurm leads from that in 1992 , in the rennställen average ten technicians worked in a season of a maximum of three or four improvements have been able to introduce .
In red bulls team today are 180 highly qualified young people . With powerful do they lead analyses and all possible changes to the rennwagen by .
The siemens-manager stated that the plm-software is in the situation , all elements of the rennwagen of Red Bull to analyse and improve , with the exception of the motors , for the only Renault responsible .
The materials , the fuel , the aerodynamik and the safety elements will be changed .
The changes can thanks to progressive production plants and hightech-autoklaven in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of simulators in reality .
The only border , the this crazy technical perfectionism is set , are the $ 40 million , which is a Formula 1 - team for his race in a season should spend .
Red Bull has its hightech-fabrik for the development and production of its rennwagen in a 50 kilometres from London off the ground .
There are two buildings in which visits , particularly of journalists - are very limited .
All that is happening is top secret .
The workforce is 580 persons , including the two pilots , the world champion vettel and mark webber .
But red bulls true Formula 1 - zweifelslos hero is the latest world champion Sebastian vetell .
Behind the enormous technological resources which the energy-drink-hersteller in the services of its participation in the race tracks , hide other protagonists , whose support invaluable and their profile is zero .
The technologichef of the plant , Steve nevey , stressed that five years ago could even say that the progress made in the area of R & D for rennwagen with 50 % to victory and contributed to the pilots were responsible for the rest .
Today , the anteilswerte changed . The technology makes 85 % of success , while the contribution of the pilots to 15 % .
Nevey recognises that vettel and webber can never be replaced by computer , because they `` are not voraussagbare gladiatoren . ''

This decision to end the most serious rechtsvorwurf against Senator Ensign , the Republicans from Nevada . Until the scandal , the nationwide for headlines , and his career dampened the thing that it was the possible Republican presidential nominee for President for 2012 .
As Senator ensigns bekanntgab office , he was on the judgment after the year-long investigation 'delighted. ``
The ethikkomitee of the Senate , however , could impose a disziplarstrafe .
According to the ensigns by the Spanish Ministry of lawyers , they were informed that the investigations against Senator Ensign were recruited in this matter and that no more charges .
The Justice Ministry did not comment on the case .
The judgment was for many ethik-anwälte outside of the Ministry of Justice , a surprise . Their think there is sufficient evidence that has disregarded the lobbying-verbot Ensign .
Interviews , e-mails and other documents that for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times were made public , gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton , one of his election agent , helped to lucrative contracts , in order to be silent about a affaire with hamptons wife Cynthia to buy .
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign ensigns as National Treasurer .
Ensign , contact some political friends on , at Hampton in work . According to the documents and interrogation took it to you after the attitude hamptons lobbying .
Since Hampton recently in ensigns wahlteam , it was allowed to it for a year no lobbying for his former employer or the whole of the Senate .
According to a statement of ethik-experten contravened the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton , the before the affaire were closely friend , against the so-called ban on the drehtür-lobbykratie .
In accordance with the published circumstantial evidence 'to is apparently a consultation and the violation of the drehtür-statuten , `` Stanley fire , a Washington lawyer , which is based on the defence of clients specialised the targeted by the government .
During the Justice Ministry officially rejected , the reasons for the decision in ensign-fall to announce , said Mr fire and other ethikanwälten , the Ministry notes in the very careful to political charges for a large number of defeats , of the media have been followed with great interest , including the decision last year , the case against the former Senator Ted Stevens due to mismanagement on the part of the public prosecutor .
Prosecutors ' are obviously schreckhaft , `` said Melanie sloan , the chairman of the Association of 'citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington ' ( an organisation whose objective , the fight against corruption in parliamentary and governance of the United States is ) , a group of lawyers , the various charges against Mr Ensign has brought to justice .
`` That means in principle that hochstehende government officials now be able to assume that the laws are not apply to you ' , added it .
Paul coggins , hauptverteidiger of Mr. Ensign , said in an interview that he had a telephone call on Monday of a public prosecutor and received a further the next day , in which he has been told that the Ministry of any complaints against its clients will rise .
Mr. ensigns defenders had cooperated with the public prosecutors , in order to convince them that the senator , as his office in a statement on Wednesday again repeated , 'in accordance with the law. ``
Mr. coggins refused , the legal arguments he put forward to the public prosecutors to explain in more detail .
'I am not , in the gesprächsdetails between the justice ministry and me . Only so much is said , we believe that the right decision to have , `` he said .
Last month , the bundeswahlkommission decided that the investigation because of a separate legal action by the Group on ethics , after a payment of $ 96,000 of Mr. ensigns parents to the hamptons against the bundeswahlgesetz have violated .
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money something other than a gift .
NV energy , a large company in Nevada , the long time the Senator supported , was one of the firms , in which Mr Hampton , thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyisten-arbeit took place .
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that , after the company Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist has promoted , Mr. ensings chief of staff , John Lopez , a meeting with Mr Hampton had , in which he told him that he , in the Ministry of Interior , because of a cause `` anklopfe . ''
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers from Nevada , allegiant air , agreed to lunch and asked the Transport Ministers , a meeting on behalf of the airline to reconcile , after these Mr. Hampton to lobbying had stopped .
As last year , for the first time , information on this affair to apologize to light , Mr. Ensign in his electorate and gave his position in the Senate to where he in the order of precedence of Republicans fourthly , had been .
Many months after he was no longer have noticed , told Mr Ensign two weeks ago told reporters that he would like to see a third term of office in the Senate .
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer be the objective of police investigation , declared his pressesprecherin , Jennifer Cooper , the Senator hope that the ethics committee very quickly the example of the Ministry of Justice and its investigations einstelle .
`` Senator Ensign is pleased to his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada , '' said it to continue .

The eis-universität
In the 'gelato university ' in Bologna eiskonditoren seasons , be better prepared .
The three days grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest gain and visitors from around the world .
What is actually the whole ice ?
The gelatiere and the gelataio .
The gelatiere , a little old-fashioned the eiskonditor in German , is the cream after all the rules of the Italian eismacherkunst .
The gelataio is catching up with a spachtel the ice cream from the kühltheke , it abolishes in the waffel and selling them then .
In order to know , we must not after anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna .
But anyone who would like to know more about ice , which is not in the 'gelato-university ' the Italian firm carpigiani over .
The eis-universität , the manufacturers of eismaschinen set up in the year 2003 , so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals .
The three days grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest gain and visitors from around the world .
But there are also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and internships in the hauseigenen eisdiele .
Some in the midlife-crisis is dreaming of a new career , other venture simply time on the treacherous ice their vague aspirations .
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries , from all continents - of Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia .
, Jacky kunstlehrer from California , loves the slow-food-bewegung and will in future in the country of the industrial ice-cream a European quality product .
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and wants after years in a nervenaufreibenden job a little own eintüten .
Two young ägypterinnen dream in Cairo to open a eisdiele .
A man from Malta and one from Brazil , the quality of the ice cream in their bars improve - and the Canadian housewife Yulia , because their children Italian ice cream love .
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the first participants , the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream .
What is crucial is not only good taste , but also the seidige geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency .
Luciano forgets in its training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen überbaus : `` Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism . ''
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple .
Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk , cream , powdered milk , sugar and stabilisers in a major mixgerät , with an electronic programme everything to 85 degree inflamed passions and then immediately to four degrees are cooling .
Then he is of the machine a tap on , and out is a pasteurisierte White basiscreme , basis for all milcheissorten .
Will the lecturer immediately with questions bestürmt ice cream : we can only with natural substances without stabiliser ?
How can we allow the own experimentierlust free ?
Luciano warns that spirit to be fooled .
Those of ice cream 'only from natural ingredients ' speech , has probably still stabilisers used - usually a natural product , for example from the guarbohne guarkernmehl .
We can not , of course , also without ice stabiliser , only it must then be sold within one day , otherwise it sackt in together , and the customer to bite eiskörnchen louder .
Certain variations in the grundmasse are allowed .
It will be more exciting with the flavourings .
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano between the different ingredients , which you obst-abteilung or in the sweets of the supermarket are buying .
Moreover , there are powder and pasten .
`` The suppliers are all try to foist onto you dozens of aromatised additions . ''
`` But you should simply time to experiment . ''
Either in the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits .
Or just in the ice cream from the White grundmasse , the with eggs to yellow flower will and with kakaopulver on the basis for all possible schokoladen-verführungen .
Now the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen .
Luciano leaves they each four different types of vanille- , schokolade- , mokka- and produce haselnuss-eis - with or without eggs in the grundmasse , with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives .
The same experiment will also be subject to the fruchteissorten .
More flavourings , more frucht-püree - ; it will not necessarily be better .
Not necessarily nussiger haselnuss-eis tastes , if it contains more hazelnuts .
The most popular kiwi-eis , the working group , which used more fruit , less water and a little less stabiliser .
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato clear says Luciano .
Eisherstellung is a rechenaufgabe : will pfirsich-püree with much sugar used in the sugar grundrezept , must be reduced .
For zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar necessary .
Luciano prefers a device , with which he the sugar content of the determined fruchtsorten ( wine growers measure so that the oechsle in grape musts ) .
Fortunately , facilitate the rechnerei tables .
To make ice requires not more so much physical use as before .
Not only the equipment for the automatic manufacture the grundmasse helps .
There is also a device , which at the same time the ready-made eis-mischung cremig beaten and on minustemperaturen kept cool .
Despite all the computerized remain small breakdowns .
The Brazilians Gustavo acquitted itself and its kurskollegen from top to bottom , with fruchtpüree than him the überdimensionale hand blenders spiral out of control .
`` in each course , '' says Maestro Luciano , 'it is only a matter of time before that happens. ``

To the six gruppenmenüs was a weihnachtsmenü for EUR 30 or more than preishit added . One has the impression that the customers are prepared , 10 % more than in the previous year and , in exchange , to spend more details , such as , for example , cava .
Also in some companies , it sees Green sprossen are , once again why the employees will be invited . This gives the impression that the gruppenessen once again in the recovery .

Secret of komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new , American diplomatenleitungen by WikiLeaks were spread to reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians , vis-à-vis the Americans believe ; they , but with the same blow the superiority the latter to Canada open .
Consequently , the American diplomats surprised that the Canadian voters in the ballot , not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in the spirit , and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government , budget from 2009 .
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington , the public have spread , yesterday , still offer more juicy details than the mere substantial content , which has a very bad outcome .
A of 22 September 2008 carved link , that is to say in the period in which the Federal wahlkampage are in full swing , was reported on the point at which the United Nations is not more to the by their political leaders discussed operations .
The great surprise by David Wilkins , of the American Ambassador in Ottawa , used .
Mr Wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation .
'A the Canadians almost innewohnender inferiority complex led to the Canadian , political leaders may be much more likely to on internal matters of everyday life , as the United States in this election pass the buck ( as in 1988 during the campaign on the free trade ) , `` he describes .
The United Nations , so he schlußfolgert are thus `` of the proverbial Goliath this choice : omnipresent , but potentially to threatening , in order to talk about him ' .
The Ambassador understands this ' deafening silence 'the less , when the two countries intensive political and economic relations .
`` logically , '' he assessed , `` should it , the ability of candidates , a party and much more of a party to hold such an essential relationship that the voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the sense . ''
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 of Terry breese , geschäftsträger in Ottawa , sent communication , the President Barack Obama on his first visit to prepare in Ottawa .
`` their journey will help , the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February , in which Canada to ensure its first deficit after more than a decade will be aware , the result of a belebungsprogrammes in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars , '' describes breese .
Nowhere , he had mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary sitting before Christmas must , in order to prevent the Parliament of the coalition and would throw the so conditional continuation of the opposition parties , on the quality of the proposed belebungsprogramms would impact .
A further , from January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins communication drafted agreed by the Washington always negative image that the anti-terror broadcast on CBC , dramatic series of the United States .
The ambassador is concerned about programmes such as border , little mosque on the prairie , intelligence and H2O , in which there was little subtle allusions to Maher Arar , `` or the '' no-fly-list contributions for the purposes of by muskelprotze of the CIA conducted interrogations can see .
Yet another communication reported in detail on how Hillary remarked in their French counterparts , Bernard Kouchner in her first bilateral meetings have asked whether Europe is prepared to include certain prisoners from Guantánamo .
Mr Kouchner is the answer is ' yes ' , but on the basis of an individual 'case to case `` -entscheidung .
At the end of the meeting , àm , `` he has described the Mrs a paper in terms of Omar Khadr handed over , a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin . ''
`` The Secretary of State has promised that the acts once again durchzusehen . ''
Finally , we note that the WikiLeaks inflame passions in terms of the website .
Tom flanagan , an old and Stephen Harper very closely on a kind of advisers , had declared that the CBC for this massive leak killed 'responsible ' .
He was here to Mike Huckabee CITES from the United States .

While the government in Burkina Faso , at least try to defuse the witch hunt , the gambianische President last year the President himself mitgemischt properly .
`` President yahya jammeh stirring up after the death of his aunt a monstrous witch hunt , since these supposedly share of their death and were now to try , including the President himself by black magic kill . ''

More and more parents want to menschen-überwachungsgeräte under control , in order to have the kids
The fear for our own children is growing , and so are considering more and more parents , you by GPS to monitor .
The system that was originally to searching for cars was invented , can not in fact people places as well , which also in such cases would be helpful , as recently in the spurlosen disappearance of the nine-year anička janatková .
The device is currently about the same size as a packet of but soon there will not be greater than a a wristwatch .
Many people , the case of the disappeared anička in fear and terror and so do you , looking at ways and means to protect their children .
Also for the price of a deterioration of their privacy .
`` We are trying to all to say that it is not in any way herumspionieren , but an effective means to lessen the likelihood that it leads to tragedy comes ' , Petr pilin macro by society because , and one of the suppliers of gps-ortungsgeräten on the Czech market .
`` I admit that it can come to the abuse of such equipment , for example if there is someone in the pocket , without that he knows , but so far we have had no such case . ''
`` The most customers buy it really is for security reasons ' , adds pilin .
In his opinion , should the child but always know what purpose the 'box ' is used and how they used in the event of an emergency .
The kinderpsychologin Dana bočková notes , however , that a child , if there is such a thing , it may not wearing his simply pace .
`` also very small children show great creativity when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled . ''
`` The mobile phones initially gave birth to the parents high expectations , but they are just as easy to shut down , as this new überwachungsgeräte ' , Mrs bočková .
Their opinion is also controversial , whether such a body in the event of an attack actually helps .
`` In planned kidnappings controlled the kidnappers virtually always , whether the child has any electronics in itself , with which there could be located . ''
`` Today is the mobile phone . ''
`` If such überwachungsgeräte broader use publicized , would you , as these also seek their sale sure would be accompanied by massive advertising . ''
`` in these cases the criminals are one step ahead of the police , '' says the psychologist .
It acknowledges that similar equipment in a sudden attack by a paedophiles can be extremely helpful .
Roberta čech of the society RC monitoring , according to the ortungsdienstleistungen both for passenger cars , as well as for people , of the existence of such a appliance can also help if it then , immediately after the attack will be destroyed .
`` The machine , so that the respective position in certain intervals . ''
`` even if it immediately to be destroyed , at least , is the final position of the person involved available . ''
`` in more expensive equipment is even a neigungsmesser integrated , that is to say , if you are hinfällt and bewegungslos remains , sends out the equipment immediately a warning , indicating the position , '' claims Mr čech .
In his opinion , could similar services also intelligent mobile phones with navigation , we need only a specific software einzuspielen .
The problem of the current ortungsgeräte is that it is either in order to appliances in streichholzschachtel-größe , similar to the supporters or smaller mobile phones .
There is always the risk that it loses .
Mr pilin from the macro because , according to it , therefore , in the present testing equipment as normal digitaluhren look like .
`` It has the advantage that the possible attackers not at all needs to recognise that it is a monitoring or localisation device which makes it possible .
`` or he can see the only after a certain time , what the police are a zeitvorsprung ' , adds it .
No matter which way the development - towards armbändern or supporters , always will be the same technology , as in the case of fahrzeugortung .
Therefore , the combination of ortungsfunktion with the help of the gps-systems ( just as the navi in the car ) and the function of a mobile phone , which the current position .

The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America will more , as the support of private companies .
Crime is a greater problem than the unemployment .
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than that of the United States .
This outcome was the latinobarómetro-umfrage in 18 countries and carried out exclusively in the economist has been published .
Since 1995 , this survey is being carried out regularly and shows that the meinungswechsel in this region .
Two facts in the year 's survey of September and October particularly in 's eye .
Firstly , the good mood in Latin America
And , secondly , the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions .
In many countries of the South American pazifikküste has greatly increased the democratic movement ( S. table 1 ) .
In Peru , for example , where the economy since 2002 by around 6 % is growing every year , the number of demokratiebefürworter of 40 % in 2005 to 61 % this year .
In Mexico , where the economy since the strong collapse in the last year recovers , is such a trend .
But only half of the people polled in Mexico and Brazil , the most populous countries of the region , are convinced democrats , which reduces the regional average ( S. graph 2 ) .
Around 44 % of the respondents said that you with the democratic practice of their country to be satisfied . That is as much as in the last year , however , 25 % more than in 2001 ( graph 3 ) .
Some 34 % trust the Congress of your country and 45 % of their government . Both values are those of last year , but a sharp increase from 2003 ( 17 % and 24 % ) .
A decade ago , Latin America 's economic crises undermined the efforts to bring more democracy .
The so during the Great Depression , thanks is probably that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession , and a speedy recovery .
In addition , the poor by a stronger sozialnetz instead .
( according to reports of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America from this week , 2009 , the level of poverty in Latin America only slightly and is again this year by 32 % . )
But from country to country , there are strong stimmungsunterschiede ( S. graph 4 ) .
Brazil 's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken .
In Mexico and Central America , where the recession was more tangible and violent crimes have increased , this is less the case .
Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country is a greater problem than in the unemployment ( S. graph 5 ) .
Some 31 % say that either they or a family member in the last year have been victims of a crime , but to 38 % in the last year are the values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995 .
The rising economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of the private and the market economy : around 71 % of the respondents überregional stated that the private sector is essential for development , in 2007 , it was 56 % ( S. graph 6 ) .
Approximately 58 % said that only the market economy their country can bring progress , compared with 47 % in the last year .
Interestingly , 62 % of the respondents in Venezuela this view maintained ( and 80 % are for a private sector ) , even though its left-wing president , Hugo Chávez , many private companies nationalized .
Brazil has according to 19 % of the respondents ( 18 % in the last year ) the greatest emphasis in the region , followed by the United States ( 9 % , unchanged since last year ) and Venezuela ( 9 % , compared to 11 % in the last year ) .
The people polled in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America , on the other hand , see the most influential country in the United States , and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela will be accepted .

Therefore tried the leaders of Esquerra with a nod to the new critics to gain , what its position until the next local elections would secure .
For the beginning kündete yesterday that the over 200 Regional Council members of ERC is about his remain in office could express secret .
With ballot papers , not with superior hand .
If the carodisten the präsidenen a fine miss , could you wanted to do this without fear of reprisals .
Indeed , the head would like to both the impression of division , as well as the of subjection to avoid his person .
In several interviews he confirmed that he would with half of the votes plus a not feel confirmed , and he added without any indication of prozentwerten , a result of 'in the Bulgarian style ' would be a good thing .
The Carod by the President , who are close to call for more than just the party office . An inadequate gesture , since puigcercós the supreme body of the kongresse controlled .
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to enhance resignations have will you with the chairman of a vorgehensplan from now until May .
For this they expect in the drafting of the document on strategic change of direction , the management on 18 to the vote in the Council , will be able to participate .
Its intention is to guarantee , for puigcercós . In return , these promises , the Congress in the autumn of 2011 , what the leader already for a fact .
The leader of the ERC is of the opinion that the `` polyphonie '' a pity the stability and it seeks once and for all , the organisation in the situation , their dirty laundry wash behind closed doors .
In this sense , the article of the President-in-Office conseller Josep huguet signed up to in his blog , symptomatic .
In view of this , the puigcercós is an ideologue , considered the holders of innovació it for a fact that the party leaders ' in exchange against various objectives ' will be based .
He was five to , two of which the priority .
Firstly , the 'restructuring ' of the governing board , so that this at least 90 % of the Party members , that is , the inclusion of new faces from carods environment .
The second could the great news .
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the vollversammlungsprinzip as operation .
So he verfechtet a reform of the Statute , which should make it possible to hold the kongresse with elected delegates .
By the end of the vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in the Spanish party system - is puigcercós ' team that already on the last two conferences , obsessed with fought for it .
Indeed , on the bebenden assembly of 2008 , the party leadership with the review of the vollversammlungsprinzips on a congress on the reform of the Statute should deal .
This deadline is still out , since infogle the internal aufruhe of recent years tackling this matter was not advisable .
Now , without the critical sectors on the lookout , could be the time has come , in order to take up the matter again and for ever .

Sport and regelumgehung
As the tricks of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness , but not the will , a sanction .
The supposedly of two players of the Real Madrid ( xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos ) evidenced by the exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax of the Champions League that caused much ink has been spilled on whether it is a unsportliche act or not and whether was possibly both players should be sanctioned by UEFA .
As is well known , the two players lost a few minutes before spielende ( your team had already clearly won ) time and played several fouls , now so that the referee you the second yellow card .
In this way , and as the Real Madrid his group would , will be the two players in the next ligaspiel the prescribed sanction against the auxerre fulfil and so without cards in the next spielphase embarkation .
Finally , the population of the UEFA disziplinarkommitee the coach of the clubs , José mourinho , with two play and the relevant players with different sums of money .
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice , it is more often in the world of football .
It is so widespread that it forms part of the ethos - the unwritten , but in the sport - is our rules .
Part of the law debate about the case described , is due to the fact that a team of the club Real Madrid ( which in its anthem edelmut and honour and on other occasions its players for similar incidents punished the major role played ) , and on the dramatisierung by mourinho , of an episode more to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians has added .
In any case , is the debate about whether this does not expressly prohibited behaviour of the statutes is contrary to the principles of sport , that is to say whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung . Indeed , believes that this approach to the statutes of the sport , seem but whose sense .
In this matter the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated .
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponent , an aspect that has been put at risk by these actions do not , because it was not a aggressive game .
A further aspect of a clean game is to prevent the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefits from gegenteam . That did not happen either .
The paradox of the activity of players of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand , because the circumvention of the rule was not taken place in secret , in order to avoid a sanction , but it should be so long as possible , so that they will be punished by the referee .
The players waited and took the sanction joyful .
Another question is what kind of benefit the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls .
It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position has brought benefits to the gespielte game were erheischt , because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to play with less players .
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game , because of the club does not then on these players .
The advantage is that the players the next spielphase the Champions League without cards , which your participation in a future game , could threaten begin .
But it is a long-term , up to a certain extent , uncertain advantage , because the team at some point could also retiring . Also receive the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus on , in which you because kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle departure .
That means that it is not clear whether it is really a advantage .
Ultimately , such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit , which also strategic decisions from the rules that will allow a maximum benefit .
In this case , wanted to circumvent the players are not a sanction ( that is , indeed , a clear case of regelumgehung ) , they wanted more choice , when it is dealing with this .
You met a strategic decision , without a penalty or to flee to avoid before her .
Although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blurred is , I believe that this matter is a clear case of imagination .
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors : because it was two selbstausschlüsse and because of the way the provoking regelübertragung .
The harm that the principles of sport has been done by these acts is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature .

Kowtow to the European Central Bank ( ECB )
Yesterday the investors responded strongly to the threat of the ECB President , Mr Trichet , the warned , `` the markets should not underestimate our capacity to react . ''
The risk premia the euro-peripheriländer are increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks is more than 5 % .
We should , however , the possibility that the ECB and the euro fooled can hardly points , which has led to the concern , not to be underestimated .
The events of yesterday are typical of a illiquid market , to the extent that it breaks down are recovered , however , as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions .
The institutional investors will not lose its fear .
A month ago , the European Central Bank has called on us to reverse our liquiditätmsaßnahmen , according to which the ECB tomorrow , for the fourth time in two years , and probably even many times in the future , taking a step backwards .
The Bundesbank , called for must of the plan for the purchase of government debt , as they are ineffective , and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen . It should only a einwöchiger permanent access be maintained .
After the irland-krise , we expect that the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen 'at least until March ' extended and the quarterly invitations to tender with unbegrenztem access on quartalsende to ensure the liquidity at least until June to be maintained .
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continue and a stärkendes signal will be spent .
If the created expectations are not met , the excellent response of the markets of yesterday set back again and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquiditätsmaßnahmen , can only God help us !
Just as with the ezb-sitzung in May , in which the Bank reiterated , the purchase of staatschuldpapieren not to consider the markets and then collapsed , could this history repeat tomorrow .
The ECB must be credible and persistent .
In May it demonstrated the teeth and on Wednesday , she said , much has to have bought , provoked a new collapse of the market .
Yesterday was the auction of one-year staatstiteln in Portugal rather weak .
The state asset management was only 500 million to 5,28 % , compared to 750 million to 4,81 % in the previous auction .
Nevertheless , the interest rates fell by 30 basis points in Portugal in the whole of the curve and reflected a wahrnehmungsveränderung of markets after the words Trichet 's .
In Ireland has been the figures of the schuldenlochs of allied and Bank of Ireland published .
The sum is to about 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000 estimated . There is time to February , in order to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalised .
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after the problem with the stress tests in July had not recognised , the figures in the framework of the rescue plan , acceptable and help to reduce , the uncertainty .
However , the government on Tuesday the parliamentary assent to his new budget . As they still do not have the sufficient support , Ireland is still a source of uncertainty .
Angela Merkel has their discourse on the summit of Heads of State and of Government on 14 December moderate . There is political unity asked to show that together we play the same score .
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony .
The Spanish regierungspräsident yesterday the plan of action , the Friday to be adopted by the Council of Ministers .
Pension reform , transparency in the autonomous regions , such as in the financial institutions , the dismantling of the staatsdefizits , liberalisation , privatisation and job creation schemes . The measures in the ears of the investors as vivaldis four seasons .
The sabbatical year Zapatero and Mr Trichet , explains why the Spanish stock exchange by 4.5 % , twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges .
In comparison with the February was the response of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincing , and we will benefit from the surprise result .
Today there is a crucial auction a three-year bond , which might the benefits from trichet-effekt . That is why we will draw on a strong demand that all the doubts about our umschuldungsfähigkeit will remove .
For Spain would be the application of a hilfsplans a self-sacrifice .
We would liquidity , which we do not need . The Treasury has EUR 40 billion available , three times as much as in the march . The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would without any notice closed .
Nevertheless , our strategy should Caesar `` s wife must comply with the slogan : `` now is not only that , but also appearances . ''
Only courage that we create !

Tech toys considers its geschenkebudget in balance
This year 's favourite under the gifts is the iPad , possibly followed by a Microsoft kinect videokonsole . Both can play a considerable hole in their geschenkebudget .
An iPad costs as much as five bmx-räder for $ 99 , while the price of a kinect-spiel about 10 classic springseilen or around 48 doses play-doh .
But they can protect their geschenkebudget .
Recently I visited in search of three elektronikspielzeugen under $ 80 three national spielzeughändler - a Wal-Mart , a toys ' r 'us and a bj ' s wholesale club .

And although less new toys with its own website , will take place on the best known of this type , webkinz Penguin and club , an improved supply .
There are more and more knopfzellen-betriebene toys to the market , and many of them contain wiederaufladbare akkus .
Here are a few recommendations .
( if not different , are all prices of toys ' r 'US . )
Sing-a-ma-jigs ( Mattel , $ 13 , for children from 3 years ) are plüschfiguren , as large as guinea pig , the A grade , if we sing on its stomach .
Even push is consistent with a note by mehrmaliges we can play down a song .
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony .
Respect for : if you have even begun with the press , they can no longer stop .
For a combination of gesand and dancing is the dance star Mickey ( Fisher-Price $ 60 , for children from 2 ) the best choice .
On the basis of the last year developed elmo live-technologie offers the animatronische doll recantations as ' Simon says ' , and thanks to the novel scharnierfüße with radblockierung they dominated the moon-walk .
Children who use the equipment quiet where monetary Mickey as tanzlehrer . Their parents complained about the lack of lautstärkeregelung .
If you are a child of the 1980s , you surely remember to alphie , one of the first computerisierten lernspielzeuge .
Now he is back ( hasbro / playskool , $ 40 , for children from 3 ) , with a whole bunch of fragekarten , with the a autofahrt to an hour 's training delivered , with a besserwisser with autokorrektur-funktion as teachers .
If you do not like to her child wish to entrust their smartphone , here are three independent alternatives .
Mobigo of vtech ( $ 60 for children of 3 to 8 ) is the cheapest and benutzerfreundlichste solution with a qwerty-tastatur . The point of the Games , however , are not so instructive as the on the leapster Explorer eliminated ( $ 70 , for children of 3 to 12 ) , the following leapfrogs major first revision of the leapster-reihe with a new , helleren screen .
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes .
Ixl of Fisher-Price ( $ 90 for children of 3 to 7 ) used for the Games and ebooks a system similar to iTunes , and thanks to the sd-kartenlaufwerks can also be said to be family photograph .
Finally , there are still scrabble flash ( $ 30 of hasbro , for children from 8 ) . The five bloc are of no more than a matchbox and have their own led-bildschirm .
At stake , it is a question of the units to words together , before the time . It is great for an improvised buchstabierwettbewerb .
More and more toys have a kind of online-verbindung .
If you only after the supply in the toy shops , are the most important Penguin webkinz and club .
At their child a online-tier the club Penguin , they can , for example , to give a Disney club Penguin 2 'mix ' n match figurenpaket ( $ 5 for children from 6 to 12 ) buy a coin , with a geheimcode contains .
If it works , receives the code online her child in the club Penguin store enough credits for another two parts .
This can be rollschuhe or a puffle-stofftier .

The käfer moves quickly to 12 vibrierenden silikonbeinen in any direction .
It makes fun of it with a irrgarten from klötzen .
And he has quite a lot .
Our fell from the dinner table and survived even some time in the mouth of our reasoning .

Second mandate : the offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle had really clipped .
Mitterrand had believe that he stutze .
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac , not the slightest hesitation .
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that .
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next .
The current head of state is so candidate in the year 2012 .
But the offenkundigkeit is the side of the mysteriums that accompanies the can not , not good to face .
We must therefore act as if the doubt henceforth to be implemented .
In a , as well as in the other sense .
In 2006 , the supporters of Jacques Chirac , a third mandate is not excluded , without even to believe that .
On 15 November assured Nicolas Sarkozy in any serious tone , his decision 'at some point in the autumn of the year 2011 ' .
For on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the ump-parlamentariern the prospect of 'two credentials ' full would therefore , had a little fieberhaftigkeit widespread .
This was the official announcement of its candidacy ?
Far from it .
The President has just to remind you that the Constitution in 2008 the number of the five-year terms shall confine myself to just two .
He has made a statement , not an announcement .
It is not the first time that he at such meetings of the presidential election in a humorous tone mentioned .
At worst , `` you have still seven and a half years with me , or at best , '' he told them in July 2009 .
On a new in May 2010 : 'do not think that I do not reflecting on the period after that . '
His words of the day before yesterday not to make it more candidates than the previous day , but also no less .
They should then comment , from a twofold reason .
The acceleration of the wettlaufes at the candidacy with the PS on one side .
But it is not the inclusion of competition with Ségolène Royal , the Nicolas Sarkozy are so desperate to unfold .
On the contrary , it is its obvious candidacy in 2012 , the many Members of the PS earlier than to challenge remind adopted .
The poor surveys on the other side .
For the first time , the voters would the rights a candidacy of François Fillon , of Nicolas Sarkozy ( 46 % against 44 % , according to the survey of the bva-l 'express ) prefer .
`` We have a candidate , and there is no discussion with the UMP reacted immediately and careful , '' the environment of the Prime Minister .
`` if it is a defeat as possible , it would be not candidate ' , shares Mr Raffarin with .
`` It will always believe in it , able to prevail , Alain Juppé 'corrected , which deals with the offenkundigkeit has resigned .

Police action in China will be soft
As a ausbildungsoffizier step Tang shenbin on an urban place , revised its nervous subordinates and gave it with military authority and gedämpfter voice orders .
He wanted , that its female members of the chengguan - China 's robust of urban order , feared and contempt for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - the viewers .
`` are ! '
'Look front ! '
`` shows you ' , he flüsterte to them , ' How nice girls as are ! '
Four girls , hardly the teenager-alter age , with white gloves and identical olivegrünen jacken and trousers were staunchly .
Four few black pumps were in gerader number .
Four proper hats were perfect with blau-weiß gestreiften held its hair .
'for me , you see , on average , from ' , says Mr Tang dismissive remarks .
`` models are pretty . ''
Several governments have already tried , the image of China 's stadtinspektoren polishing .
In a city must all new applicants have a university degree .
The Guangdong province , instead of the graugrünen a leuchtend blue uniforms .
Violence in mittel-china wuhan replaced by niederstarren : 2009 umkreisten according to reports , a 50 officials not properly established and imbisswagen gaze at the operators , by this after half an hour einpackte and left the room .
Xindu , a stadtbezirk in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants , would like to fundamentally change the image .
Since 2003 , strengthen 13 women the urban polizeistreifen . They have been specific because of their appearance , their good figure and their young people chosen .
They should crude police a softer , femininen aspect .
Unfortunately , however , it would also be very difficult scarlett johansson , the bad image that the Chinese of these stadtkommandos have , to improve .
With the right to do so , the critics .
Unlike the police , must these civil servants of the urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties .
But the Chinese media routinely a different picture .
In January 2008 beat officials in the province of authorized a spectator to death , as this it with his mobile phone here , filming them as a protest against a dustbin still .
Last year was a schulungshandbuch the Beijing officials stolen and published on the Internet , it is described as criminals can be beaten up without bloodshed .
In this year suffered a Shanghai wassermelonenhändler after a handgemenge with five officials gehirnverletzungen .
A from violence strotzendes videogame that can be downloaded from the Internet , shows in China trained officials in an attack on straßenhändler .
`` fear '' chengguan power of the government , the national newspaper lamentierte China daily in the last year , after further controversy regarding the tactics .
The newspaper called a `` really thorough cleansing ' .
The current approach for sceptics are clearly inadequate .
As the distrik in October by display eight female recruits , was an editorial in the Beijing evening news , the question whether the women real tasks , or only as optical distraction .
Probably both .
According to the vacancy notice women were at the age of 18 to 22 with good figure and `` harmonious looking like ' .
They should be - on average 1,5m or 5 foot , 2 1 / 2 customs .
The employment ends with reach the 26 birthday .
According to the officials is the activity for women on 25 physically to demanding .
'the most important thing is their image , `` was a unbenannter distriktbeamter in the almost regierungs-webseite rednet.com .
Whether the candidates ' get the job depends , first from their appearance , as size , weight , gesichtszüge , etc . '
Then come temperament and 'internal qualities ' .
`` female chengguan are as put , '' he said , and added , `` but they also have other obligations ' .
Zheng lihua , deputy head of the City Council of the distrikts , would not agree with this description ,
But made to that in China größenvorgaben advertisements for both sexes are not unusual .
The same applies to steady gesichtszüge .
Whether this is synonymous with good look like in China , is controversial .
But people with disabilities or physical corruptions need not to apply .
`` We can do here , unfortunately , not a lame or buckligen use ' , as Mr Zheng .
`` their image would not be good . ''
Liu Yi , at the close of a monastery baoguang-platz patroliert , is 22 , has apfelbäckchen and a well geformten mouths .
They empfindetes not as a sexist that such great store by your appearance .
`` you , I see in this uniform sexy ? '' asks you with ironischem view .
With the grübchen your colleague , the 21-jährige Xu Yang , comments , `` we have the task , the image of the city to represent . ''
You say that you regret the brief attitude is not , as it could have been more ambitious karrierepläne than simply by the alleys traders to scheuchen on business , in order to prevent them .
Every morning deals the some remarks with some 12 straßenhändler trying to foot or on the bicycle as many as possible to sell rolls and tofugerichte fortgejagt before you .
'Mr Wang , disappear , here you please. ``
`` We have them already said so often , '' declared frl . Xu a trader who have fled to foot was his on a fahrradkarre befestigten nudelküche temporarily in the lurch .
According to the civil servants is the activity rather monotonous as demanding .
`` It is almost every day , '' says the same Huang Jing , 20 , the recreational vertriebswesen studied .
'Everything routine. ``
One reason for this is that the women officials the were the traders not , as their male colleagues , must confiscate .
You can only criminals , they threaten their male superiors to report .
This is to protect them from public harassment , which often suffer civil servants in China .
In this year rioted outside hundreds of inhabitants of , Kunming , , the capital of Yunnan province , after the rumour stock-market boom , chengguan-beamte would have a traders killed .
More than a dozen policemen and chenguan-beamte were injured in the night of the incident , 14 regierungsfahrzeuge upset or have been set on fire .
Xindu remained of such violent incidents have so far been spared .
But riots are not carried out .
Only two blocks away from the calm baonguang-platz , on which the female officials this morning , patroulierten gathered on 50 people on a street corner .
Officials had a motorcycle confiscated , contrary to the rules on the pavement rather than in a workshop was repaired .
The owner cried screamed blue murder .
After 15-minütigem hesitate bahnten the officials with cruel face the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner .
Li xuedong , 40 , a coordinator of the male some remarks , remained . It was he refers to in order to be namensschild in order to remain anonymous .
As your colleagues to play the coordinators - men over 40 - purely a supporting role .
But they have not been trained to present a clean image .
`` sometimes go before we verbally . ''
`` but also often physically , '' says Mr Li well-balanced .
Most of the time , 'people are with the dispute. ``

CECA fills a second wave of mergers of savings banks from
The Director-General of the CECA , José Antonio olavarrieta , dismissed the opportunity yesterday to a wave of mergers , that it might be the savings banks and emphasised the speed with which the industry will be restructured .
As the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began , there were several savings banks to participate in the first phase not . They retained the second round .
On the other hand , assured the Director-General of the Spanish sparkassenverbandes ( CECA ) , José Antonio olavarrieta , this second round would not take place .
'I believe that most of the mergers is concluded . The inclusion of cajasol in the group Banca cívica can not be regarded as a second round , it was rather adaptations. ``
`` the greatest part is finished . It may be that we instead of siebzehen 13 or 14 , but all the important processes are already completed . They have been from Banco de España , all transactions has strong support , controlled . ''
In a by the association of the directors and managers aragoniens ( adea ) organised breakfast led olavarrieta from that of the concentration process `` as quickly as possible , has taken place and that we must be satisfied with the timescales set the end , in former times , not now , in the context of the business plans with Banco de España has been laid down , '' he emphasised .
'the transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million vermögensbestand to 17 with ever 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process . The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 % and they are now very much greater , and that is what we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement ' , highlighted it .
Olavarrieta stated that 'there would be a number of unabgebrachter opinions on the slow pace of the process , the unseriösität and absurdity ' revealed , because `` Banco de España reminded us , before the end of the year . '
The Director-General of the CECA , José Antonio olavarrieta , assured yesterday that Spain is one of the rigorosesten financing systems of Europe and 'perhaps `` around the world have and added that those who anzweifeltenn this ' without deeper knowledge 'would do .
The managers has said that we are in the current economy 'no ' on the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks need to do a `` very important 'concentration process have gone through , the '' as quickly as possible ' will be completed .
He reminded us that the Spanish banks the stress tests , which the ECB in July , very good had existed .

With literature the finger on the weak spots
The second round of 'the desire of the language ' was a walk in which the participants for the narrative strong ,
'this with the sex in the language I do understand , but ... the finger on the wound ? what is expected of me ? `` asked the writer Luisa valenzuela , the second round of Los placeres de la lengua ' should open up a cycle , the spanischsprachige literature celebrated and on that occasion the subtitle your question used ( on another event was the Round Table devoted to the sex in the language , it declared ) .
The finger on the wound ... 'brings us in difficulties , `` the Argentine spuckte schriftstellein sweet the audience that mainly from young people at the international zusammensetzte book in Guadalajara ( fil ) met to this by marisol Shultz moderierten round table , to attend to the valenzuela , Sergio Ramírez , Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part .
Luisa valenzuela Las a text which they Gonzalo celorio and of the Shultz then as a great narrative marked . Luisa told and is in the first person were the originator on the search is to know what a 'wound ' is , and by the doctor to doctor is , of which you are no answer , but evidence of the guide to its narrative .
The infektologen leaves you convinced : 'patience is not my strength , maybe that is my wound. ``
At the end , after a very frustrating rapprochement to the trauma theorists , of her in the middle of the way the breath raubte , and of their but stated that wound is not a scientific concept of enthült psychoanalytiker the secret : `` The wound that is truly open , the symbolic is the scar . ''
The like the narrative sighs easier and includes that they `` of the wound only learned that this really open and does not exist ' . But it is convinced that the desire of the language and their fall mingle .
Valenzuela , the writer , played with two .
The Nicaraguans , Sergio Ramírez asked a entzückende narrative , which he called 'praise of the invention ' , and in which the finger on the wound not mentioned , but will be detected .
With reference to the magical realism he tells of a famous zauberin , which struck the clouds far gereiste men or the of a girl was lost virtue wiederherstellte . The narrative made a U-turn and reported of America , the great novel , the it from the very beginning not to his own chronisten was missing , and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo , of the abundance of of the eroberen told stories .
`` Cervantes , the US all ( the writer ) invited the hypothetical quality , spottete witnesses who have been outlined in the true stories were present , but in a different way would be the history of America 's never been told - with imagination , even the shame has disappeared . ''
However , stresses , `` it is the crazy and liar , the best things imagine ' , and there are coming closer to reality and lie to each other , where we no longer know which side the narrative is one where the fictitious literature the Summit achieved .
He calls the , in fact , the 'tradition Cervantes ' .
`` We have inherited from him , what are being told . ''
As to the number was Mayra Montero , annotated and praised the writer of the diversity of the interpretations , to which the invitation of the fil to the round table 'the finger on the wound ' contributed .
The kubanerin and puertorikanerin devoted their contribution of the great wound of social violence , which affects their country - as all of Latin America - as a result of the fighting for the drugs trade .
'I believe that good literature , good poetry , good songs a tacit , not deliberately planned commitment contain ' , said after she had highlighted that literature communication and binding force is , between the author and readers , like a `` chemical reaction '' to build on .
The evening , the Spanish poet , Luis García Montero , whose contribution also 'these fingers of committed writer in the wound of the writer ' hevorhob .
He said that , in a very fast-moving world also the intellectual habits and the control of the awareness on dogmatismen , and forget that 'that behind every confirmation of a small no is behind every denial and a small yes. ``
`` to be in possession of the idea and the reality of the situation , we must set an example , and often puts into perspective , the focus on a burden and to those who , the much feel more comfortable , if it is in the form of cartoons , in black and white , in ready-made ideas without nuances thinking , and also the powerful to harass that prefer , the world in black and white them he observed and invited to rediscover the meaning of the letter .

The battle for the fresh graduierten will be even harder .
In many sectors , the companies their staff not more from a big handful of candidates to choose .
But they must extol and particularly to highly qualified workers balzen .
Above all , graduates from the ingenieurdisziplinen are in an excellent negotiating position .
According to the association of German engineers vdi remained in October on 40 000 ingenieurstellen unfilled .

The right matratze and the right bettenrost ? women have other wishes than men
Not the tollste bettrahmen , but the quality of the liegefläche - so rost matratze and make the good bed .
However , this must be in harmony , and with the wishes of the specific user .
The choice to play a role on many issues - the weight , the size of the state of health and , last but not least , the sex of the schläfers .
It is also just as important , in which interieur matratze and subordinate rost .
Typical example ?
In a wochenendhaus , in which no regular heated latexmatratzen , are not suitable for much longer , as they need to be `` hot . ''
Moreover , they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen .
And - they should be turned on a regular basis .
If you do not have enough entlüftungskanälchen in essence and even on a firm plate , staut , humidity , so it is not excluded that under your schimmel .
In the election is , of course , also a role , in which it is used to .
Anyone who was long time abroad , where very high matratzen with weichschicht , will be difficult to a low matratze with hard surface can get used .
`` All an ice-hockey player , which have come back from the nhl , have complained to me that you are not more right can sleep . ''
`` for their abgeschundenen shoulders , closely and hüften need it simply a weichschicht from visco-schaum ( memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer ) . '
'This , I recommend that , among other things , also zuckerkranken people under a disruption of the nervous system , so that they are suffering from the ' information 'from the ligaments and skin can receive bad , `` says Sylva hadamcziková on polstermöbel .
That is why I have many years ago , but also other customers eishockeyspielern these matratzen with visco-schaum ( memory foam ) concerned .
`` Today , this is no longer a problem , because such matratzen offer the manufacturers tempur , among other things , the Italian firm magniflex or the Czech manufacturers tropico . ''
And we must not necessarily be a famous an ice-hockey player , the benefits of the visco-schaums learn to appreciate .
This `` miracle '' actually works quite simple .
The foam optimalisiert its rigour and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat , in other words , it is downright schmiegt on warm body .
Nowhere is it , in the night shifts not around as after a serious fight .
It is sleeping easy much better .
The foam viskoelastische also offers protection against dekubitus ( gangrene ) .
In the election of the matratzengröße should be to height still the length of the fußsohlen to that , is approximately 21 to 34 cm .
As Mrs Mann , the to the 180 cm are great , need as a 210 to 220 cm bed .
Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available , together , therefore , 180 cm .
In einzelbetten of , for example , singles are 120 to 140 cm appropriate .
The own comfort , and also for any visitors .
Otherwise , the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite : `` If you on the back is , should still enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor , '' advises ing . Helena prokopová , the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter that for years the issue of healthy schlafes and good ergonomics of furniture and to put this question to colleges .
In a doppelbett everyone needs its own rost and his own matratze , but be careful when buying products , so that the matratzen also are high .
Otherwise , can not do other than the roste in different level to fit and that is not in any bettrahmen possible .
At least 14 cm schaummatratzen should be high , with matratzen federskelett 15 cm , should at least three centimeters on the formschicht and the feinpolster .
'with the hand or the sit down the feathers in no case , warns Helena prokopová felt . ''
Any matratze makes a specific rosttyp required .
Ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom .
These matratzen can not be and to reveal the reference you can not wash today , which is already there .
And since it in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses , it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years of slow to a huge ( and congested sieve ) .
That is also why reject experts werbeslogans in matratzen a life span of up to 25 years ago , yes even lifelong guarantee promise .
Has any matter it .
And is therefore a practical Council by traders : in matratzen of 120 or 140 cm broad should be the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren salary , not be afraid , nonetheless , it is recommended that a matratzenschoner , easy to use and laundering can withdraw .
Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss are produced , so one after the open up two halves gets ( immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße ! ) , the manipulation , with greater matratzen alone , above all , often carried out as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath .
Have you in the bed rather than a rostes a firm plate ?
Get out of it .
Or a maximum for a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night .
So they should also prefer the plate with lüftungslöchern oversight ( provided that there are already not ) and matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm of minimum allocation with the so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use .
Polyurethan-matratzen belong in such a document not .
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten ( lamellen ) are suitable or latex- sandwichmatratzen ( possibly also combinations of latex and kokos ) , always figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl , from 28 and more federleisten from , with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility to regulate the lattenhärte .
On verstellbare lamellenroste not include matratzen with federskelett , because it does not respond to the ergonomische verstellung .
In addition to the attitude of the rigid the federleisten special flexible schultermodule will also be required .
This is a specific integration of the federleisten which allows the federleisten einzudrücken verwinkeln or even so that the specific einsinken the back of the schläfers .
Particularly for men with broad shoulders an important matter .
There are even matratzenhersteller which have started , in 'herrenmatratzen `` weichzonen to use for the schulterbereich .
Also to the ladies is thought - you off these weichzonen in the hüftgegend .
For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme ( lattoflex ) or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with so-called multitorsionsfederung .
The pressure will be distributed on a number of points , which will reduce the tension .
But , if you at the right matratze and right rost a bad ( to great and fülliges ) kopfkissen , used the most benefits go back lost .
Here , too , a rule of thumb : the kopfkissen is supposed to be the head , its leaders should only up to the shoulders rich , so that the schultermuskeln can ease .
Ideal is therefore a 50 X 60 cm great kissen , as for example the Scandinavians .
In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen ( together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or the weichzone in the matratze ) the schulterhöhe in balance .
Some have our modern matratzen have with the former ( with hay EU-US ) strohsäcken but in common .
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their mixtures .
Also in matratzen means the new magic word 'organic ' .
Instead of erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example rizinus- and sojaöl .
Soya is used by all known manufacturers .
`` organic matratzen , that is to say in their heart from materials purely of natural origin is , '' declared by the firm Petr vašíček tropico plus .
Naturstoffe but are also used in the production of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera .
One can but also mikrokapseln grant the sleep fresh forest or lavendelduft .
Here , too , there is a difference between men and women .
While the men a `` kühlender '' pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used , so that the matratzenbezug the heat and cool can absorb the body , the salary for women 'wärmende `` effect .
Extracts from red paprikaschoten stimulate the blutzirkulation , the weaker sex will the sleep so warm wohlig .
And today 's favourites ?
From kaltschaum matratzen ( he has greater poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than handelsübliches polyurethan and also much more flexible ) .
Through the combination of the various stiff ( rigour ) by kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen arise , the know exactly where head , hip and closely .
For a high-quality matratze has , however , you 7 000 kroner and more to berappen .
Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually with lower VAT , as they apply as medical aid .
The first Czech enterprises has been given gumotex this advantage .
We will see , in the matratze and on rost saving is not so easy .
Now and again , there are special offers of manufacturers and traders , the two matratzen for the price of one .
The brand magniflex the matratze duofreeze with in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK .
The second will be free to do so .
It was the material tempur , that the era of viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace .
No wonder they have been but for NASA , because the astronauts are developed in the launch huge überbelastungen .
Will tempur in heat soft , in a cool environment to entrench it in turn .
So it is the human body perfect and distributed in the best possible way the körperdruck .
It is , therefore , not only to prevent druckbrand ideal , but increased the schlafkomfort in general .
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe will not only in matratzen , but also in other gesundheitsprodukten , such as , for example , in particular fußpolstern , used the legs and the gefäßen should provide relief .
For example , domestic producers use the schaumstoffe eucatherm C , twinsaver or similar products .

The altenpflegeheim confirms that the deaths not to 'lack of measures `` are due
The owners of the altenheims in olot not conclude from that their carers on eleven older people killed
The leaders of the altenpflegeheims la caritat olot ( Gerona ) , in a press conference yesterday , in which it out to the damage the criminal acts Joan Vila dilmés - the carers , which , during its work at least eleven old people , for which he was responsible , was killed - the institution had done .
The head of the altenpflegeheims , Joan sala , resigned in the company of his lawyer , Joan cañada , tried to and announced , `` la caritat would like the responsible ( for the deaths ) indictments ' , but 'the right and our accountability require it the process and the civil liability ' .
The establishment must not only a social being discredited , because they accept the criminal actions of the pflegers not identified in good time , but now also pay a high allowed by the rechtsvertretern of the families of the victims will be calculated .
Joan Vila dilmé acknowledged that the first crimes on August 2009 fall and it since been murdered have further .
The judge ordered the fate through the exhumation of eight bodies - the former patients of the altenpflegeheims - , because he was suspected that no doctor the late personally have investigated the formalities , but because of their age and diseases by telephone .
The head of La caritat verneinte flatly this point and stated that 'lack of adequate measures keinerzeit the reason for the incidents may have been. ``
The lawyer of La caritat also added that it 'in the legal dispute no evidence of negligent acts of a person as the accused. ``
The already as `` Angel of death 'getaufte acknowledged eleven murders and said the day before yesterday , the first crimes committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later the second old lady murdered .
In this case , he killed with an overdose of insulin , unlike the first crime that he a mixture of different sedatives .
The head of La caritat said the access of the staff to the drugs is difficult to control .
The insulinspritzen and the beruhigungsmittelcocktail , the carers in six of the nine crimes committed to the patients with the death of their suffering .
But the results of laboratory tests will tell whether Vila is lying , and for its first victims in fact a less cruel death or whether he chose this from within by giving you ausbrannte bleichlauge according to mention , as he had done in three women confession that he between 12 and 17 October .
In La caritat listens to the statements of the pflegers not believe , not even as the number of gestandenen murders , which could well be more . This attitude is justified that Vila very different things in court and that it had made no sense , his approach after eight successful murders suddenly to change .
You say that you were you , therefore , and to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice available .

450 million in treaties without tender
In mutual agreement has hydro-québec projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts for the wasserkraftprojekt eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved .
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 treaties a consortium , consisting of the firms , bpr Dessau , Groupe sm and axor , that the most important proportion , namely that of projektleitung , to a sum of $ 295 million without invitation to tender has received .
This consortium , known as the 'énergie gérance ' , 2004 as a corollary of the decision of hydro-québec their responsibility , the private sector , this important , hydroelektrische project to the tune of a sum of $ 5 billion to future generations , is being set up .
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium 'énergie gérance `` the lucrative treaty , without that there had been a public invitation to tender .
For the Parti québécois is resorting to unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem , the risk of wettbewerbsverdrändung and an increase in the making .
`` This is a new way of a conspiracy and refutes the competition . ''
'This means that instead of conventional games rather than on secret way now in an open form is carrying out ' , said yesterday , a Member of the PQ Sylvain simard , at the press conference .
In the early morning simard had raised the question before the French National Assembly , because it seems difficult to understand him as the interest of the public in this way can be used .
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie normandeau had reacted in the afternoon , by was vehemently deny that this Treaty is a stitch-up would have acted .
`` I am sticking to my line , '' they raged by you confirmed , the PQ was `` dishonest 'and ' an absence of rigour ' .
She said that it was the least 'that the PQ is sorry .
The model of the consortium is the world standard practice .
It is usually at a time of such temporary alliance that it two or more companies their expertise in terms of a requirement for a tender for a complex project .
The project 'eastmain ' has a high komplexitätsniveau with regard to his arbeitsausmaßes .
The bauverfahren is in progress and is to be drawn up until 2012 .
However , the Treaty has been missed , without that had a competition can take place ; it had already negotiations .
Furthermore , the model of the consortium in Quebec , with relatively simple projects by no means an exception .
As the newspaper 'Le devoir ' last week has pointed out , is that in the area of bauingenieur- and beratungswesens applied model of the consortium subject of regierungsermittlungen .
A brief overflying the quebecer unternehmensregisters allows , more than 200 consortia to nominate , some of which of consistent duration appear to be .
In this way , for example , the company Dessau working in partnership with the majority of its kernkonkurrenten to which Cima + , génivar , snc-lavalin or Roche and tecsult count , together .
Any link , and there are several dozen , leads to one and the same legal person , namely Dessau .
What the consortium 'énergie gérance ' , that was Minister normandeau stresses that 'the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special arbeitskräftedynamik hydro-québec this fact and that since the 1970s , in a special way , however , take into account ' .
Réal laporte , the major employers of Société d 'énergie de la Baie James ( sebj ) , has made a statement , the Fed has to be on the fact that the Treaty on the projektleitung after agreement was approved .
'If you an invitation to tender power and it only a few candidates , there is your prices soar. ``
`` You are , therefore , two possibilities : either you nimmst the people on this Mart and you are saying : it will be a satisfactory agreement on a good price negotiate . ''
`` the idea , however , is that not the price is crucial , but the expertise of the people , '' reaffirmed laporte .
This the consortium 'énergie gérance ' approved Treaty is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 of the Parti québécois received dollar .
The Treaties have been from either the hydro-québec or the sebj eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved for the project .
After review was the newspaper 'Le devoir `` more than 100 ingenieurs- and beraterverträge , the companies or their branches , including in particular ressourcenlabors , between 2002 and March 2010 have been granted .
Snc-lavalin had 22 treaties in itself , gerafft génivar had received 14 and 16 , tecsult Dessau 10 , without their participation in this ' énergie gérance 'counting .
All these agreements have been negotiated .
They amount in the entire on 449 783 344 $ , including the Treaty with `` énergie gérance '' on 295 131 564 $ .
Sylvain simard had indicated that the four firms , which form the consortium ( bpr , Dessau , Groupe sm and axor ) of the `` Parti libéral you Québec , well known . ''
Minister normandeau , had the PQ is equally with the firms that they `` financed ' , before you specify that it is , in fact , its managers .

Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the 'green ' label is not very heartening
Green , but clearly sceptical .
The quebecer consumer has little confidence to the key players of sustainable growth , however , nor to the marked brands or the öko-kennzeichnungen taxes , his election .
It is a pity , even though it is in a medienwirksamen universe swimming , where it of information in favour of a responsible consumption teeming : the barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to mourn , a shortcoming that his commitment as a brake mislead power , as the first reading was held yesterday , has shown .
Although the consumption of the so-called socially compatible products in the year 2010 , seem to have promoted the quebecer , however , those who sell it to try to show little credit .
Two thirds of the quebecer population is , in fact , the environmental commitments , rather than relax them of the firms nor to believe as the Greens unternehmenswerbung , so does the responsible consumer centre of the University sherbrooke sophisticated instrument .
Another fact : half of the consumers doubts the trustworthiness of the official , to the supposedly fair products annexed certificates , but also the credibility of the products and brands , and declare , disposing of the barometer .
According to the same pattern will the discourse of politicians on this issue of only 14.6 % of quebecer population seriously .
The information concerning responsible consumption seems , however , important to stimulate this konsumsegments , currently only approximately one third of the quebecer consumers will be given .
In fact , as dampening empty and dubious character of the information the zeal of 46 % of consumers .
This is after the higher price of products , the second , on the part of the barometer identified brakes .
In addition , it is a third of the quebecer of the indicated performance of green products and services which they put in hand is trying , with mistrust .
According to a other communication was already over half of the consumers in the years 2010 to change their habits and predominantly the brand of one or more products change , in order to give their conviction .
According to the barometer , they were to 61 % purchases dealers and their stadtviertels prefers the purchase of food crops cultivated in their region .
Greener and more responsible - the index of into environmental consumption in this year had a 64 of the maximalwertes of 100 achieved - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to be king of recycling , which seeks to present his in the environment are collected traces to reduce it to the welfare of animals .
But the social and environmental awareness seems nevertheless , just before his car , so the barometer : just 28 % of the quebecer have indicated , in 2010 public transport or the mitfahrzentrale used to have preferred , in order to demonstrate their environmental interest .

Erdarbeiten Puzzle
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria .
The country , but to take a view on this - nor is it controls .
Against midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 I at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes a mysteriöses , würfelförmiges buildings in Syria .
It is on the banks of the Tigris ; the next major city , 30 kilometres away , is dair as-saur .
Your name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) on when it comes to the reactor is that Syria supposedly with aid from North Korea in the quader has built , hidden in a valley , that of the electricity .
According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be the also under the name of the middle town el-kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons .
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties hardly .
The CIA has led a videopräsentation before with by means of fuzzy satellitenbildern .
By computeranimation blendete you a , where the components of the reactor before the destruction have been , of a fell copy of the North Korean model from the atomzentrum Yongbyon .
In addition , it presented photographs in the building , from the vicinity show or even the innenraum .
The reactor is just before the beginning of the operation , it was said , but not yet with brennstäben have been drawn up .
Today , more than three years after the bombing , is hardly more than it was then , yes the mystery were in time , a greater .
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs , reveals that the CIA before the attack in fairly sure was that Syria in el-kibar a reactor built , but little evidence that saw it in the country 's nuclear weapons programme 'active ' .
Some intelligence officers in Europe there are rather more cautious , and yet only talk of a 'alleged reactor ' , even if the cia-präsentation for `` plausible ' .
They lack hard evidence , as well as the IAEA .
Asked how sure he was a reactor , to have a high un-diplomat , replied in the summer , the IAEA have only flat `` enough material to ask questions ' .
The rubble of the alleged `` unused militärgebäudes '' surpassed the Syrians are in a hurry to one side and planierten the terrain thoroughly .
Nevertheless , took place in June 2008 a iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium , which had been produced by people .
In addition , the IAEA on a Member State satellite pictures provide commercial operators from the period immediately after the attack , which should be more significant than that presented by the CIA .
These , however , are starting to get on the market , not because of the unknown contracting authorities - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusively .
The IAEA can therefore verify their authenticity not independent .
Syria has always claimed that never a secret nuclear program farms or a reactor to have built .
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons , declared Damascus .
But the , the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely .
Since then refuses Damascus , debate on this - as well as on the satellite pictures provide .
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of zerbombten building .
But Israel remains silent pugnaciously .
`` We will comment on the never ' , confirmed recently the at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's official position .
So on the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless `` is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority ' , as a high Western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA in Vienna gives - after all , it is a serious breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area on which the IAEA watchdog .
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment , the IAEA appear to be three more bodies , the `` in functional link 'with the alleged reactor are should - and other than this still exist .
The inspectors have so far not disclosed , at which it is that is still what role they have or what they seem suspicious .
According to information edition of the Süddeutsche Zeitung , they will be in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan masyaf iskandariayah described , and that , in turn , are derived from nearby towns .
The independent institute for science and international security in Washington ( ISIS advises ) has identified and that these places on satellitenbildern a gebäudekomplex in masyaf tracked down , which is probably one of the suspects objects .
It is probably in or directly , in addition to a military base - precisely with this explanatory statement Syria the IAEA are denied access to the three places .
In Vienna , it says the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA of the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military equipment .
Because the nukleardetektive were by a piece of advice of the US intelligence services attention has been drawn to the institutions .
The IAEA has evidence , including satellite photos that between the three places and the quader on Euphrates material hertransportiert back and forth .
A high Western diplomat in Vienna has said , at least one of the installations could 'in connection with the brennstoffproduktion ' .
There is , however , 'no indications of sensitive activities ' , in other words , uranium enrichment and reprocessing ; processes to the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary .
The type of reactor will be pursued with uranium , which is not supplemented .
But where the uranium would have should come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated , on these central issues there are at best plausible guesswork .
It is also unclear whether debris , the valuable traces might bring , to the three places have been stored .
As if the hundreds of stands of disappeared from the face of the earth , no one wants to have any information as to where the rubble .
The only a few kilometres from el-kibar on the other side of the Tigris , salzmine al-tibni , the Syria 1998 to their suitability as camps for radioactive waste , the IAEA has investigated as unlikely .
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley it had in a recent analysis of satellitenbildern for the renowned magazine Jane 's intelligence review with the reactor .
Starting from the orbit show , however , that Syria to the three suspects places erdarbeiten untouched and large container distant , after the IAEA access had requested .
This can hardly be a coincidence , but has helped to dispel the suspicion .
It also means the IAEA in diplomats , have spent many months , a plan for inspections there , to develop the it Syria should allow any military secrets to real , the burden alone shows how great the interest of the inspectors .
Also , however , Damascus bügelte this proposal .
Western diplomats in Vienna had a year ago have been allayed , the reactor was destroyed , therefore , the matter no high urgency , brings about US Ambassador Mr Davies for a couple of months ago so-called sonder-inspektionen into play , one of the strongest means that the Vienna atombehörde has to controls .
Iaea-chef yukiya Amano , of these inspections should propose , has already of `` an option , for which I am open in the future ' , but then it is dragging its feet .
There is a high risk in this way : on the one hand , it needs a majority in the Board of the IAEA , and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than eager to an escalation .
On the other hand , as a diplomat to are concerns : `` What if they find nothing in the end ? '

They had of Bangkok from the in Spain and other European countries established cell .
The Catalan network - a part of that was in the year 2009 has been destroyed - steel especially tourists passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called 'international Islamic front ' .
This means that the documents on the name of men in the age of 25 to 45 years be issued and several years had to be valid ; they were not visastempel .
In untersuchungskreisen underlines that until now , no links between the people arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay shown to have , although the author of this attack , `` laschkar e-Taiba '' was , one of the draw the in Spain stolen and subsequently in Thailand fake passports .
Nevertheless , it should be recalled that a few days before the attack in Catalonia from by means of a geldtransfer-unternehmens several thousand dollars were sent in the purchase of prepaid-karten for mobile phones , `` '' have been invested , the later by the members of the 'commandos `` that the lives of 106 people , an end to have been used .

A tenants of bakala : It revives in the foot , but nevertheless pays higher rent
An older untersetzter man is leaving the klientenzentrum society rpg byty of `` kohlebarons '' zdeněk bakala , of the largest privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic .
A file under the poor with three new mietverträgen to three homes : for the own and the homes of his daughters and his son , who is a sentence .
All three within the framework of the so-called 'deregulation ' just the rent increased .
Instead of SEK 3 500 monatsmiete is the son in the next year for a 2-zimmer-wohnung with cuisine of the second category of SEK 4100 berappen .
'and there is in the home not time a fluent hot water and heating must be in a simple kohleofen ' , for he angry pointing the finger at the new mietvertrag of the son , to the signing of which he has a power .
'But what - who I signed , `` he says half and half resignedly annoying .
Bytyokd.cz 's citizens ' Association , the new mietbedingungen as `` incorrect and immoral , '' the tenants , the new Treaties simply not to sign and until 7 December in which it intends to publish a guidance as to how to take action against such treaties .
But the man beckons only .
'A says this , and the other is the ' , makes it a benighted face .
The region will Ostrava so much `` deregulierungslabor . ''
After the new year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before , whose tenants no market-oriented rent figures .
Aktuálně.cz decided , therefore , this `` laboratory '' personally .
The rpg-warteraum in havířov is one of four in the region and Ostrava already nine o'clock in the morning in this Tuesday brechend fully .
Alongside the door the bodyguards a safety agency and to her a aufrufgerät .
'rent 2011 , `` is a special tastfeld on the touchscreen .
Briefly touched upon this and already the machine spuckt a nummernzettel .
We hardly have the number '157 `` entziffert and already piepst you on the large screen an indication to the ceiling of the warteraums .
Half a minute later is one 's turn .
A little later enter an older married couple the warteraum after the rent to questions , but the rush in warteraum is obviously not the new rent .
Most people are here to the usual problems to solve - reparaturanträge , insurance and so on .
From the middle of November fly in the region the Ostrava kuverts with the new mietverträgen most tenants of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolios of rpg in the letter boxes .
The rpg byty proposes to you in the letters a mieterhöhung of around 15 to 38 % .
The specific switch to the new rent in the klientenzentrum is opened since 18 November .
`` The action is something over a week , that is to say , this is only the beginning , '' answers the honourable behind the counter hesitate for a moment , as the 'legal ' as a journalist dictator .
The deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue .
Before the elections , the from Ostrava deputy speaker he lubomír zaorálek originating from the čssd taken up this issue very loudly , no wonder that , today , the newspapers are full of this .
Twenty years of `` I want to you a new floor . ''
'not time ne besch . Wc-brille they could change ' , makes the aforementioned man air .
Up to now , according to the staff , are particularly pensioners switch to in order to convince the promised mietermäßigung , whether they really received rpg promises you , if you sign the spezialangebot in good time .
The benefit of a half reduced februarmiete should also the other tenants , which the new mietvertrag by 15 December .
Up to now is ' deregulierungsschalter `` in havířov but everything other than overloaded of follow-up questions .
'from yesterday 's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 , because here ' value the schalterbeamtinnen .
Rpg offers both on their websites , as well as wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen , where it seems necessary .
Should the mietparteien but not to the new rent some , will you of an independent court .
`` that is not a threat , but as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand , '' says rpg on its web sites .
`` This is no one in court , '' says one of the workers from rpg byty and a man on the street before the klientenzentrum is their right , at least in part .
`` I have welcomed 13 , 000 ( crowns ) pension , I remain 5,000 to eating left , where I should the money for a gerichtsstreit come from , '' he says .
Then the employees but uncertain .
`` time . ''
'Mr zaorálek says you on the media , they should not sign and waiting for it to the people even ' are you to bear in mind .
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to new year 2011 and , according to the mieterhöhung rpg byty is an economic necessity .
`` the existing level of rent is not enough time to the maintenance of the wohnfonds from ' , argues Pavel klimeš , the director of the wohnungs-portfolios society rpg byty and - particularly of the disgruntled tenants criticised neglect of the wohnungsfonds is , in the opinion of the main reason for the mieterhöhung homeowners .
While rpg in the years between 2005 and 2010 collected from the rent four billion could invest in the homes , in the four years from 2011 until 2014 , is it to be 5.2 billion .
On the großformatigen lcd-display to the ceiling to the polstersesseln in warteraum of havířov appear again and again in a few red shining information .
`` The mieterhöhungen in 2011 by 15 % and less concern 31 200 homes , which means more than 90 % of the homes of rpg . ''
This means `` always at most 7,50 CZK per square metre and month ' , is on the lcd-monitor to read .
Only in 400 homes from the portfolio of rpg has increased the rent by 38 % .
`` in these cases it is the increase in extremely low mietpreise of 19,66 CZK per square metre , '' argued rpg .
In 2600 housing remains the rent in the next year at the same level .
Rpg byty promises that the deregulation of the rent not in leaps and bounds , but gradually within four and eight years ago .
What is more , the company is imposed on a further obligation : all of the revenue from the mieterhöhung ( see graph ) , the companies in the homes are again , particularly in wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and in the thermal insulation .
But , primarily , those who benefit from the people , the agreements on the mieterhöhung sign .

In the middle of secretly
In the weeks after the sudden death of their man was told Argentina 's president , Cristina Fernández , a wave of sympathy which their beliebtheitsrate by 20 points to over 50 % . This is the highest value since your election in 2007 .
However , whether you do in the next year to a re-election provides , depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández compromise than their deceased husband , your predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner .
The signs are not clear .
Néstor Kirchner , even after the election of his wife the economic policy , was often budgets in the tax revenues , economic growth and inflation is not fully into account .
This allowed the präsidentenpaar , the extraeinnahmen spend as it sees fit .
On paper , the fernández-regierung last year the majority in Congress .
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner 's death after a heart attack on 27 October has led to further divisions .
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández .
But after chaotic meetings ( in which a parliamentarian another in the face of other proposed , and the Government of the bribery accused ) , the Congress not to adopt the budget for 2011 .
`` I will not discuss ' , as the President .
The 2010 budget applies now for the next year , which the President has an even greater opportunity to spend money as they see fit .
The economy is hotly : probably will it this year by up to 9 % increase .
The official inflation rate is z.z . at 11.1 % , but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - are pushing the value to nearly 30 % .
Kirchner , the 2003 the took office as Argentina of economic crises ridden growth and poverty reduction , said to his primary objectives , and not the inflationssenkung .
He refused to the cooperation with the IMF , the private sector and säuberte has singled out for bullying as the National Institute for statistics and census , which then indec official inflationsstatistiken schönte .
Fernández now can we route ?
It has the private sector and the trade union leaders , called upon to talks .
And official statements according to that wage increases in the next year to 18 % should be limited .
The high prices for Argentina 's agricultural products have been a strong boost to the economy .
But the burst of inflation undermined by a great devaluation in the year 2002 .
Perhaps for this reason Cristina Fernández would like to Argentina and back to the rest of the world .
At the beginning of this year , the government an agreement with shareholders holding the former debt restructuring of the country in the year 2001 had rejected .
Now it seems that Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to which it owes around $ 6.7 billion .
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF elsewhere , as usual , been rejected .
But in the last month , the Finance Minister Amado boudou known that the fund in the drawing up of a new national consumer price index `` technical support ' . It looks as this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the indec .
It is not known whether Fernández after the end of its term of office , even without the support of their husband politically active will be .
If so , it needs the support of the middle class , which is largely by the kirchnerismus has enough .
If the Argentines from their summer holiday in March , will return to the wave of sympatie , it was shown to be fizzled .
If you would like to gain a further election , it must decide whether it many political choices of its man quietly lifted .

The trail of stones
Uli gsell has also what concerned , a total of around 400 kg .
On Monday evening , he was have Stuttgart station , the tuba on the back .

He has all the bought on the demolition in Stuttgart fell .

We have named and threatened him , he tells in September in the newspapers that he was the remnants of the nordflügels from abbruchunternehmer bought .
But he has talked with the s-21-gegnern days .
And he has told them that it but now nothing for the demolition .
And if it was happening , then it is but the most sensible , if the stones were used .
Around 200 s-21-gegner then took a of , on average , 80 kilos of serious quader with , stückpreis 6,50 by EUR 14 .
As a memory , some but also in the hope , him on a reconstruction able to return .

And steinliebhaber .
He is 40000 tonnes of stones .
From the whole of Germany karrt he its value .
He says that he is of the greatest altsteinhändler of the Republic .
He is slowing down .

It is the way high by the forest .
It shows on a bunch of : red sandstein , formerly part of the Karlsruhe little station .
And further .

Once the quader belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart neckarstadions .
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories , cannstatter travertin from the Stuttgart , bringing rötlicher stone is complemented with from the Cathedral of St blasien , tuff Heilbronner hospital .

Ladies in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer , with the work on their still nameless regiedebüt has started , there is trouble .
It has the script written , a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man .
We know a lot more about this - but that is not good enough for unrest .
There is a persistent rumour , the woman , a Muslim , verliebe during the jugoslawien-krieges in their Serbian rapists .
Bosnian women `` s associations have protested immediately , and some in Sarajevo planned drehtage after Hungary has planted in the short term .
Meanwhile , the film in Hungary marginalised and in the postproduktion , but it will still protested in Bosnia .
Bakira hasecic of the organisation of female victims of conflict wrote about the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress , has a Bosnian newspaper now - Jolie is even Ambassador of un-flüchtlingshilfswerks .
It is not a diplomatic - it has already come to the women a few weeks ago , a meeting in Hungary , which offered the but refused .
The meeting should take place in Bosnia , so hasecic .
In liebesgeschichten vergewaltigungscamps it have not been Jolie attitude towards the victims and am betraying their enough about the script .
According to their organisation has recommended that the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk Jolie as Ambassador , reported to dismiss the guardian .
What , exactly , but has Jolie for scenes written ?
The Bosnian Culture Ministry , to read your script , after some and has a drehgenehmigung granted for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie then , nevertheless , not .
The jungautorin even claimed that they have no political intentions with their film , with great effort , incorporated in the jugoslawien-konflikt wanted the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all the parties involved .
On the content , however , remains vague .
So in circulation a second synopsis of the film in the network , the then but sounds rather different : the loving knew it even before war and meeting once again , as you , a Bosnian Muslim , in a becomes Serbian camp being hijacked , in which he is working as a guard .
Which is considerably different sounds as the variant `` rape victims in verknallt folterknecht . ''
That Jolie film in the war begins - that much is certain .
The pressure on you just Jolie , is ' unfair and is based on misinformation. ``
It can now only , nor the hackers of Hollywood peace : by you give the plot , as so many before , illegally on the web .

Ogoniland is burnt down
The water in rivers is ölbraun , it looks like in the petrol station ausgelaufenes : billion litres of crude oil have nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland destroyed .
The people of theft , corruption and illegal ölkochen .
Celestine akpobari means well .
`` haunts you not 'reassured the ökoaktivist journalists : '' You 'll still enough oily slime before the lens through which wars. ``
The 37-year-old Nigerians who has followed the attempt , a until the chest in water watenden young with the around it schlieren abzulichten : in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz is the scene almost function .
That , beneath the surface , Brown rohölschwaden , is not to see .
Here you have previously eimerweise shrimps collected , told Esther badom on the shores of bodo-jetty-flusses .
Now is the sluggish fluid waters completely dead .
Five years ago poured from a geborstenen rohrleitung loads of crude oil in the huge river wetland .
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen Bodo must now six hours to row in fischhaltige waters : located in the heart of the nigerdeltas Ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world .
On the journey through the river realignments criss-crossed mangrovensümpfe will the full extent of the devastation crystal clear .
Instead of water helles wühlt the motorboot Brown brühe who his hand into water comes up , attracting ölige finger .
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen from the ground , sad I occasionally unbalanced palmen their wedel depend .
Vogelschwärme in wetlands , as usual , are not to be : as soon as the außenborder remains silent , is spreading in the as a filling station riechenden former paradise ghastly calm .
'What is happening here , is ecological warfare , `` says celestine akpobari gloomy : '' We live in constant danger for the health . '
The kriegsvergleich is appropriate .
The area where they live the Ogoni people is a for decades disputed battlefield : here , more than 60 years ago the first explorateure from Europe , organised here in the 1980s with the later exekutierten writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance , in 1993 the shell-konzern here had to stop its production , because it for its ölarbeiter too dangerous .
Even today , the company is denied the return to Ogoniland : while from the whole of the delta region of the three times the size of Switzerland , with over 5 000 bohrquellen and 7 000 kilometres pipelines , more than two million barrels of the black gold , are the oil fields be pumped resume oil operations in Ogoniland collapsed , the company is too unstable the situation .
All the few hundred metres stählerne gestelle stand out as bizarre sculptures from the water : `` christbäumchen 'will the heads of the boreholes much to zärtlich mentioned .
They are up to 50 years old , the most to the core korrodiert .
Time and again , promoting good-quality such a bohrkopf akpobari rinne thinks , then a constant stream of crude oil into the water .
More than two billion litres of are experts estimate that in 50 years has flowed into the ecosystem of the Delta : year after year the amount of oil , as you in the sinking of the supertankers ' Exxon Valdez `` 21 years ago in the sea in Alaska drive - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity .
For the continuing öko-gau who is to blame , this is being fought .
During the shell-konzern sabotage and the organised öldiebstahl for more than 90 % of the pollution , see environmentalists berstende bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit .
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower safety standards than else in the world , accused the us-wissenschaftler Richard , Steiner , the company : in 2008 alone the rate of defects in the pipes , was `` many times higher than elsewhere . ''
In a place from the distant as a abandoned , ölverschmierte workshop open-air looks , are emerging from the mangroves to make : they are splitternackt and up to our necks ölverschmiert .
Under one of the many casks , the part with flasks , partly arbitrary scattered on the site associated , flackert a fire : an illegal kleinraffinerie .
This will in the barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours inflamed passions , says Michael , the leader of the group .
First is pressing petrol by the pipes in the auffangtopf spits , later , at the end of the leadership kerosene and , finally , diesel .
So produce Michael and four employees a day to four casks diesel à 300 litres of : 'This brings us 34.000 naira a `` - around 22 dollar .
The deltabewohner benefit the chronic treibstoffknappheit in the largest erdölstaat of sub-Saharan Africa .
Nigeria has only on a single refinery .
The with barely 40 euro-cent per litre of ridiculously low dieselpreis can still undercut the illegal kocher : because their raw material they get in vain .
He comes from `` bunkerern , '' which pipelinenetz across Ogoniland tap : in this way , the country go according to experts in the whole of the Niger Delta every day lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil .
Only a tiny part of the provisionally zwischengelagerten raw material , however , will fill illegally veredelt : the lion 's share of organised criminal networks , including politicians and high-level military belong to oil tankers and verscherbeln him on the world market .
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster rather on the population or the lax production methods is due to does the activist akpobari for purely academic .
The oil companies ' would not as invaders , and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen do not as thoroughly destroyed , there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries. ``
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni , above all , to shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the company in question would be : `` Perhaps are indeed other nationalities as the Chinese as better . ''
As Michael nervous .
`` high time that their disappears , 'says the muskulöse put .
`` every minute can the soldiers . ''
Will the illegal ölveredler caught by the special forces , are they not arrest , but a painful bribe .
Also the mainly hail from the North soldiers want - as all Nigerians - of the raw material benefit .
`` This damn stuff in every respect , our country has brought to the dog , '' says akpobari .

Global plan for renewal of lighting
The UN has yesterday in Cancun a plan for the renewal of the lighting of budgets , trade and industry in 100 countries in relation to the achievement of a reduction of the greenhouse gas ( CFC 's ) proposed that the almost a third of the additional reduction is the equivalent of that must be implemented , in order to stabilise the earth 's climate by 2020 .
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the steps of the specific projects that the UN in Cancun hopes , in order to implement the absence of mandatory reduction commitments to compensate for the developed countries .
After the expressed yesterday plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes of ( GT ) of the result of the lighting of the earth cast , CFCs be avoided if the weißglühenden pears , which has a monopoly of 50 to 70 % in the market , by fluoreszierende or , better still , by light-emitting diodes ( led ) were to be replaced .
The lighting is responsible for 8 % of global emissions .
This represents an equivalent of 70 % of the exhaust emissions of world fleets .
In Copenhagen last year had the great abgasemittenten such as the United States , China , Europe , and other , which was also Canada , to voluntary reduktionsplänen committed itself to ensuring that the global fckw-emissionen of 53 GT to 49 GT should face .
Of this assessment , it would , however , still 5 Gt , to withdraw from now until the year 2020 the klimaanstieg 2 degrees Celsius in order to stabilise , in order to prevent this spiral out of control .
In the weißglühenden pears built for 95 % of the energy in the form of heat , and the remaining 5 % produce the light .
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75 % , with the new LED bulbs reduced this energy demand once again in the double .
Keep the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen , on average , between 6 000 by 10,000 hours .
The new LED bulbs , such as those of the manufacturers , Philips , this week has been put on the market - this society , incidentally , has participated in the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80 % less energy than a weißglühende pear , what a suggestion of the savings of the auswechselungsplanes , should be applied in 100 countries .
In addition to the fact that iese completely new incandescent light bulbs only very little warmth , can you also with a regelwiderstand work .
And they do not contain any mercury .
Several specialists have pointed out , kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves since they contain mercury and that they therefore as hazardous waste must dispose of what in the developing countries is not always possible , but the producers are a bring centre available .
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet , according to the report , however , not the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne , but rather the coal-fired power stations , the essential emit more mercury to of the weißglühenden pears wasted to generate electricity .
In the United States alone , these are 25,000 tonnes of mercury from coal-fired power stations every year .
The report sets out in detail the profits , which each country would generate thanks to this international programme .
Indonesia would such as , for example , a billion dollars per year in buying electricity and eight million tonnes of reducing CO2 emissions , it means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations , whose erbauung Indonesia 2.5 billion would cost .

A knochenhaus fascinated even after 100 years . If you look at the interieure of Gaudi to
The roof seems to be as the backs of prehistoric echse , the stairs as the vertebral column of a dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler .
That is the Casa batlló of Catalan architects Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona .
Of the local inhabitants experienced the House with its organic forms the nicknamed `` knochenhaus . ''
Organic forms , wild paints , the unusual use of stone , kachelsplittern and to shed `` jigsaw creating false fronts and ubiquitous soft lines , all this are typical features for the jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi .
The façade of the House is playing with beautiful lines , zärtlichen paints and texturen in nature and living beings .
Only if we look carefully noted that everything of geometry rhythm and profound order dominated .
In the night , the whole façade still plastic , dramatic and the special anleuchtung reinforces the glory of the colours .
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms dominate the home of the House .
Creates ripple geformtes wood being copied the window frames , support , zierelemente of doors , even gucklöcher and .
The House batlló in quarter eixample in a crowded einkaufsstraße passeig de grácia no 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from the years 1877 , the architects Emilio sala cortese said .
The reconstruction , two years and was concluded detailed .
The investor , the wealthy industrial Josep batlló , was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building , but ultimately he voted the idea gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction .
The mietshaus Casa outlined batlló Antoni Gaudí , however , not only .
He worked with the architects José Maria jujol together .
It is precisely on the drawing board the dekorationen created for representative home of the realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaiken to the façade was his idea .
In the design of the façade worked also , however , many other bildner and artists with .
The joint work of the drafts of the Casa batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and Gaudí .
So jujol also participated in the construction of gaudís House Casa milá in the park güell , where the further work by Antoni Gaudí .
Shortly after his completion experienced the House of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknamed `` knochenhaus . ''
Others called it the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the `` yawning House ' .
It also says that at the top of the building is the sword of holy Georg , of the existence of Catalonia .
But also further bildhauerische elements symbolise hidden religious motives .
Gaudí outlined for the House for the time unique zentralheizungssystem with entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen .
A little bizarre is their 45-grad-neigung already .
In his create Gaudí consistently ignored all then building regulations and could not be deterred by this .
Before baubeginn Holte it from the city of the appropriate planning a but the claims made on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the stadtväter two years later in the implementation so horrified by the result was that they were asked to remedy .
The ratsherren is met with , among other things , that the construction , with its pillars , even in the public pavement intervention .
To amendments , we , however , not more , quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the call of the stadtviertels , Josep batlló a request for approval of the lease of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the House - and it has been granted him promptly .
The homeowner itself , in the lower echelons of a .
In the gallery , in 2 stock was a gesellschaftssalon , on the third floor were the bedroom and privaträume of housing .
The ground floor was a juweliergeschäft leased .
The whole sechsstöckige buildings is going through a stairs , right up to the dachterrasse .
Through the fundamental elements of the adaptation were all right corner and dead straight lines and removed and replaced by gebogene geschwungene walls .
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of places .
The social part is , by opening the salontüren completely and , therefore , a large society convenient plaudern , without in vertraulicheren talks on a certain degree of privacy .
The House was given by gaudís restructuring out of a new front also a rather unusual thing roof and two further floors .
Impressive is also gaudís game with the light , as well as the blue and White glasierten kacheln with which the courtyard packets is and the lichthöfe .
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the House a maximum of light .
In this he made simply to take advantage of the principle that know better reflect the light , as a dark paints , the sunlight on the contrary to absorb .
The House Casa batlló , the 2005 in the welterbe-liste UNESCO has been included , can today everyone visits .
In the first stock is the geräumigste and prächtigste housing accessible to the public .
The homeowner determined only in the years to this step and that on the occasion of the 150.geburtstags of the famous creator .
As you said , that this is a very profitable business activities , the surveys in , indeed we extended it to other common and the dachgeschossräume , including the dachterrasse .
The price to visit the baudenkmals , however , is no trifling matter , it is 16,50 euro , students , pensioners , groups and holders of touristenausweisen get 20 % reduction .
This amount exceeds the eintrittspreise to other gaudí-bauten in the city .
Who the real atmosphere of the House with his drachentürmchen know would like to learn , should try , friendship with one of the inhabitants to close to home and to visit him .

Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided for keeping the euro but , at the same time , conditions for the whole of the European Union .
The tension on the markets have a dual response of the government .
On the one hand , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures presented , starting with reductions for small and micro-enterprises , the regulation of work agencies or the lifting of 426 euro support for the unemployed , the no unemployment benefit , to the privatisation of 49 % of the management of airports , AENA Barajas and El Prat and 30 % of state lottery .
On the other hand , the Deputy Prime Minister who supported , Elena Salgado , with the aid of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González , the criticism of the Chancellor , Angela Merkel , as responsible that the current crisis have herausbeschwört .
How are these events to understand ?
It is anticipated that Merkel 's position is not a mistake of their public relations .
On the contrary , it is about a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro .
It is Germany a fundamental new perspective to shape our future , the with the retention of the ancient traditions of much of its partners .
In view of the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis to spekuliern .
The first : a strong euro , with Germany , Austria , the Netherlands and other countries , while the South would have to leave the euro area .
The second : the reintroduction of the German mark - although that currently , rather , for science fiction sounds - , supported by a large proportion of public opinion , around 50 % of the population .
The third : a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals , which means : more macroeconomic control ; strict financial management ; punishment of the countries which are invading the benchmarks ; möglichereweise the default of some countries , and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures on the private sector .
The German position is clear and is for some time already . That is why there is now no excuses .
First , in 2009 , as both the IMF , as well as the European Commission incentives for deficits created and the German Government drew up from a constitutional reform , in order to prevent it from 2016 .
That was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary ( strict steuerpläne and stable public finances ) and the practices of its European partners , including France .
The second signal , a central European country , as Merkel the decision to rescue of Greece hinausschob painful .
At that time , it was the criticism , but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany , the public and the published opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece .
Finally , Merkel in the last oktobertagen again with a clear position ; it calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union , in order to allow the saving of a country and , at the same time , the private lenders to commit to a part of the cost .
This position has been interpreted as anti-European , because they are the irlandkrise and all the following through on .
But your proposal , if somewhat sweetened , was accepted in the next few months we will be on the reform of the European Union , which should allow these measures from 2013 .
Germany has a red line , not to exceed the it does .
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures have to be made - it from that date the old functioning of the euro will not be .
2013 will the geburtsjahr of a new currency zone , in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished , can be forced to declare itself bankrupt , and in this case the private sector must take a share of the costs .
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard path of growth , with high savings and investment rates , moderation of consumption , improve the productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances .
The other alternative , the on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based , as was mentioned by Spain in boom times , simply will not be tolerated .
The offer is clear .
And we would be a bad thing to do to it not to understand .
It is not just a question of the general government deficit until the year 2013 to three per cent runterzufahren .
The demands are much tougher .
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions , is ourselves to cheat .
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm .
And that we take the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013 , make use of .
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well , and his double announcement ( the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday ) points out that , despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis , its own house in order , to create their way has been .
But the of Germany was not bold enough red line is there , and it does not seem that change .
Under the contemplating opportunities is that we the with little serious countries fully gestopften euro area , can not be ruled out .
In this case , could Germany are still say that it have warned us .

Nothing as way here
This evening , it is at last time , again rightly around for the Irish people .

`` It is so far away from home and I have no work there . ''
After all , his friend is waiting in Auckland already on him - 'you had to push their wunschjob zuck as eventmanagerin , may be a good sign , ' says the young man and is smiling .

By 2015 they expect even with 200 000 emigrants .
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss .
Hold the forecasts , there is an auswanderungswelle comparable with those of Ireland in the 1980s suffered .
After a decade of recovery for the Irish people , which brought great prosperity , is now once again tristesse wide .
The economic crisis unsettled in particular the young , well-educated Irish , for which there was only up to date .
Jobverlust and social decline railways in the boom years absurd .
Everyone was needed , money , there were available in abundance .

His homeland is o 'donovan now only rarely extraschichten , because it makes the credit for his house abbezahlen at home .
'The situation is a bit crazy , `` he says when he after a long time , for the first time on the threshold of his house .
`` I should have money in Germany for a House in Ireland , in which I am never more . ''
He laughs something and is by ausgekühlte areas .
The small house is on a fine neighborhood with cherished vorgärten einfahrten park , in the great , expensive cars .
Together with a sister has o 'donovan the House for four years ago bought for EUR 380 000 credit-financed - 100 % .
`` It was crazy times , there have been simple money without many questions , '' he says .
Has it afraid that it could go wrong with the credit ?
O 'donovan thought for a while , forever fanning hot tea after and says : `` I have no children , which I must feed and I am young ; even if all wrong , I can start afresh . ''
The engineer may not taken , that it is often heard at the moment .
`` No one needs to go hungry - our situation is far from being as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island , '' he says .
'a while working abroad , that is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we feel we have this only when Irish. ``
He laughs and told then of his father , the last great economic crisis to England .
`` After seven years ago , it was again the life was in Ireland , quite simply . ''
Cian tanner like this idea .
The future room for sidestepping and simply look to see how it goes with the lives elsewhere .
A few years of work in London , he has already been behind in New Zealand and why it should not go well for him and his friend ?
There is one thing but still , the him in these days of great concern : the celebration on his 27 birthday in Dublin on Friday .
He is afraid that it might turn into a lebewohl-party .
`` just not too many emotions , '' he says and drink a great schluck of his beer .

Some nonsensical regulations already succeeded , from the world .
The dubious winners of the next generation strive to attain the opinion poll `` absurdity of the year 'in the duty , documents on authorities to create available online .
So more than a third of not quite of four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs .
So the sozialversicherungsverwaltung demanded a papierauszug from the handelsregister , even if it would have the officials by two mausklicks access .
Thanks to the opinion poll is changing this now .
`` The Czech sozialversicherungsverwaltung will in future when controls of sozialversicherungszahlern no extracts from the handelsregister asking more ' , led the speaker from čssz Jana buraňová .
The purpose of the opinion poll `` absurdity of the year , '' it is , all the rules and orders to scrutinise the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic , have to meet and the unreasonable .
This is in this year for the fourth time part of a unternehmerwettbewerbs by the tsch . Business newspaper ( hn ) will be hosted and in public growing popularity .
If in the last year of the three thousand people in the vote , it was involved in this year of four thousand .
No wonder , because there are still a lot of legal obligations , the only serves , entrepreneurial activity .
`` What , for example , the number of einkommenssteuerformulare is concerned , we take a front rank in the world ' , says Mr Karel havlíček from the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and gewerbetreibender of the Czech Republic .
The simplification of the business activity is in the last few years the proclaimed aim of all the governments .
In comparison with the world , the situation in the Czech Republic , however , hardly improved .
According to the World Bank is the Czech Republic in relation to the unternehmensbedingungen the 74 . Rank , compared to the previous year , eight seats a worse place .
The competition of the absurdity of the year for the first time in years , has been declared and plays every year for equal scenario .

It will triumph that absurdity , the most votes .
To this year 's opinion poll have already been more than one hundred , 105 senseless rules and orders .
The clues come not only of entrepreneurs , but also of professional organisations and journalists .
Under the nominated `` finalisten '' of competition , for example provisions that instandhaltungsfahrzeuge for motorways and express roads toll or that entrepreneurs have to pay with twenty members of staff , two offices and two toilets vorrichten every two years .
The list of this year 's `` seven '' is published in the pages of competition .
The proclamation of competition at the beginning of November at the Prague Wenceslas Square is part of a happenings in which regularly also figures of the political and public life .

'where the state the entrepreneurs spanner into the , there can be no real economic recovery , so it is my aim , every year at least thirty paragraphs that today the entrepreneurs unnecessarily complicate their actions ' , informed Martin kocourek , the Minister for Industry and Trade with .
The efforts , nonsensical orders , show effect .
In 2007 the people most troubled the entrepreneurs have imposed on duty , the gewerbeamt at the place of their permanent company three days in advance of the intention to declare , with a ausstellungsstand to an exhibition or kirmes to want to travel .
This obligation has been force a series of gewerbegesetzes lifted .
The duty , the 2007 the second largest number of the vote - the duty , the job travel by workers in the scope of up to 30 days - was to declare it by the law on the so-called 'green card ' abolished .
And - of all good things are three :
The absurdity of the year 2009 has been elected to the regulation , the it physiotherapeuten sprechzimmer imposed , in a mirror , a refrigerator and two personenwaagen .
This regulation was by the Ministry of Health in this year mitigated to some extent - the kühlschrankpflicht fell way .

What can you do , the čssd ? the Czech social democrats in Prague know neither voldemort , nor the `` konditorei . ''
The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the čssd will obviously certain language barriers , have to overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the stadtvertretung able to understand at all .
The newspaper has aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the čssd time a little 'abgeklopft ' , as they dominate the notorious slang , over the past few years has become established , in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm .
The encoded vocabulary , the in the verflossenen era of Lord Mayor Pavel bém of the Prague political elite was introduced , is some of the most prominent players , situations and causae entlehnt .
Surprisingly , the new councils in relation to these new concepts of something in the dark .
The claim they at least .
`` who is voldemort ? ''
'No idea. ``
'I am a newcomer to the Prague policy ' , responded lukáš kaucký , the new ratsherr on culture , on the test of the `` paten-wortschatzes . ''
But also the ratsherr Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way .
For example , on the concept of 'golfloch. ``
`` That is the only expression of which , I am here to present to you , which I use and again . ''
`` otherwise , I believe that not much often infiltrated by slang . ''
From the vocabulary of the tageblatt aktuálně.cz in this year 's June before the wahlkongress the ODS had published , pickte the editors six concepts , especially those that are notoriously with the Prague Government .
The Social Democrats should the terms ' voldemort ' , ' greatest Prague golfloch ' , ' in the konditorei go ' , ' stiernacken , `` '' betrayal of capital 'and ' verblechen `` define .
Three Prague ratsherren agreed to the test , the fourth - Mr weinert , the future head of the Prague school system - promised firstly of its participation in the discussion , but then not time the listeners .
The fifth ratsherr , Petr dolínek , rejected the test in from the outset .
I do not care 'these things are and how the Civic Democrats with each other , about judgments I not. ``
'What is important to me , as we understand our programmes , `` he made .
As has already been indicated , would have lukáš kaucký in the aforementioned headline allegedly not realised that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém , Roman janoušek .
The term 'voldemort kaucky `` says absolutely nothing , and the only one that he was correct erriet on the test , '' the greatest Prague golfloch. ``
`` That is the tunnel blanka , '' says kaucký , added to the security but still : 'but I know more in the newspaper ' .
And jokingly : `` I will be a sprachkurs show must . ''
The `` golfloch '' will then not only of matador Karel Březina , but also by the ratsherrn on the Environment lukáš plachý appropriate as a tunnel blanka entziffert .
Both Social Democrats also know , however , for whom the term voldemort lukáš plachý senses and even , where this figure is to be found , and also , what it means is that `` in the konditorei to go . ''
`` I believe , that is to say , in any Prague gastronomiebetrieb ' , is to go plachý quite close to the conundrum hit solution , when we know that this is the seat of janoušeks firms .
In line with Březina claimed it but , this knowledge in the papers drawn strength rather than to have him this vocabulary board would be .
Judging by the testteilnehmern under the Social Democrats , it seems , in fact , no similar eingebürgerten slang .
'I have also asked my colleagues , but obviously there are we really not. ``
`` We call on us in the name and again we also use words or nicknamed ' , says the chairman of the Prague čssd Petr hulínský - of his party colleague , casual '' hulda ' .
'in the school was I bříza ( birke ) mentioned , but I do not know whether I am also my fellow Members call ' , tells us Karel Březina his nicknamed .
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has tried and see as - he works .
Ratsherr weinert is for the party colleague , enough of the `` OPA 'or less friendly of the ' old ' , the representative Miroslav poche before the elections by activity in the partei-sponsoring vocal , some colleagues ' igráček '' ( known Czech lego-figur ) .
Nicknamed are as the only one that the Social Democrats in the whose language .
It may not hulínský supposedly if it is `` hulda ' , but deník aktuálně.cz registered a other nicknamed the Prague chairman .
His nickname 'doctor of the gummiknüppel-rechte supposedly `` has to do with the fact that Petr hulínský its title doctor Juris to the bratislaver police college has acquired .

Romano is fighting for its first title
Rubén Omar Romano is looking to three defeats in endspielen back , he has again , and ( seen in his career , but three times he played crucial games .
In the match between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final , there are also two different , of their respective coaches stipulated styles , and their of contradictions , this meeting is reflected in the results .
Rubén Omar Romano is looking to three defeats in endspielen back , he has again , and ( seen in his career , but three times , it has had a decisive games , and so far he has done well , why this opportunity is of very special importance is for him .
The Argentines with the coin has played up to the second champion , he is a step lagged behind the victors and , amazingly , he has fought with the same team consecutive endspiele .
The santistische strategist , the first end game as coach in the 'torneo apertura 2002 ' , as del morelia the reins in the hand , with which he had against toluca with 4-2 learned a great defeat ; later , at the 'clausura 2003 ' he reached the crucial match that he also with 3-1 against rayados lost .
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'torneo bicentenario 2010 ' , in which you played against Los diablos rubén again , had to absorb a setback , since the game with 2-2 against Los choriceros after 210 spielminuten undecided , but the penalty he came with 3-1 forward and received two ways of losing its title , but ultimately failed three of its players the eleven steps and thus the game to a 4-3 .
Rubén had already two endspiele with the diablos rojos and one with Monterrey , his main rivals , lost . That is why he would not again be pursued by the disaster and rid itself of the evil zauber , for the first time a title celebrating , although it confirms that the most important thing for it is the game itself .
'I would like to be champion , I would break no statistics , that is for a club , for my affection , of which I am hingebe , and that is why the title will come to see me , but what happened before , is the most important ' , annotated the at , as it consulted about the lost endspiele .
The last endgame is still greatly stayed with him , he assured us , to have learned a lot from it : `` the only lesson we can draw from this , is that to the referee not the end obeyed , can we not celebrate on the line , we are also prepared , the players , because the last time we were with two elfmetern already prepared , a decent way , and I believe that this is a lesson , until the game is not over , there is no reason to celebrate . ''
To know that this series of penalty stage could be decided , concerned not him , because he trusts his players : 'you want never misery , we would like to conclude in the regular spielzeit , but sometimes , there is no alternative , and we must be prepared , in the previous tour , we were prepared , but unfortunately we were the fate of a bad game , sometimes as a result of nervousness or the strong desire , the title already in the hands , the left us with something to this end game , and we hope that this time it will not come to this ' .
It is in romanso power , not only second champion and , for the first time to be the glory to costs , the title .

The living costs of the households increase one hundred monthly around some
The households must not expect higher costs for all energy ways as of January but also wax also the rents with higher water and sewage charges and for district heating and in some places .
Monthly , families will have to pull several hundred crowns out of the purse as of January so more than till now .
Current gets more expensive until 4.6 per cent , gas by 2 per cent and more , one will for water deliveries have to pay and make more expensive in some places also the district heating deliveries up to a tenth more in some towns .
Alone the current price increase costs the flat households some hundred crowns more every year .
The strong prices of electricity were reduced by all main suppliers , so the clear promotion of the electricity generation is to blame from renewable sources , by name out of photovoltaics plants .
Although gas gets only moderately , more expensive this though exact then , if people must have the heating on most and have the highest consumption .
So there is a good chance also here for some hundred crowns more per annum .
While current and gas are getting more expensive in whole Czechia , the prices for district heating are different from town to town .
Places plan price increases primarily big .
So the households must for example pay for district heating up to 50 crowns more from January monthly , pay more as 1000 crowns more per annum families in Liberec in Pardubice and Hradec Králové .
In turn higher water and sewage charges and this threaten the inhabitants of Prague 9 per cent in case the town increases the infrastructure rent .
If the rent does not change , it is only 6.8 per cent .
The price in Prague is part , however , of the lowest in comparison with whole Czechia furthermore , too .
Being supposed to where the prices are part of the highest already now water and sewage charges increase by 7.4 per cent in the North Bohemia .
Enormous renting price increases have to be expected for example in 140.000 rented flats for which the so-called renting regulation is discontinued as of January .
So the flat enterprise CPI Byty which has 2500 flats in Ústí nad Labem plans for example to increase the rents by one hundred per cent as of January at once .
Who does not approve of this rent increase , the enterprise wants to prosecute this one legally .
The regulated rents 300.000 flats roughly pays , might next year rise by more than 10 per cent , the one into today still .

Sabadell wants his rivals 'nick ' one from millions customers within three years
The managing member of the executive board of Banco Sabadell , Jaime Guardiola , is more optimistic than other managers . He thinks that a hard year will be for the banks , at first rejects a new liquidity crisis , however , and prophesies the end of the fault war in 2001 .
He nevertheless foresees a drop of the interest rate margins for which the banks try to compensate with rises of the charges and the prices for loans .
Sabadell expects to capture one millions of private customers within three years , a subject still to be insisted .
Sabadell has found the way to exhaust the next three years and to survive about in a very complicated economic environment .
The bank will import a new three year central plan in 2011 .
The aim is not only surviving without taking this one to public helps from the FROB furthermore pick the market share out around one millions of private customers - 700 000 , extending , if one removes the customers whom the bank will lose . This is the great challenge which this bank faces , because up till now she has paid more attention than her private customer to her business clients .
This year she has got there 250 000 private customers and 50 000 enterprises .
Your market share with private customers is 3.5 per cent while more than 10 per cent are agreing on the business clients .
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the rise of the productivity , i.e . Austerität , cost reduction . She will introduce the challenges with which the bank is confronted with that together with annual final report .
In these difficult times , only few banks dare to set goals and to publish since all plans of the banks have got mixed up worldwide by the financial crisis .
Sabadell will lock her central plan optima fixed four years ago this year . This was interpreted initially for three years but because of the market situation he was prolonged by a financial year .
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the primary objective of the bank .
At a breakfast organized by the APIE Guardiola emphasized 2011 would become a `` difficult '' year `` with a long range '' .
The manager assumes , Spain would get out of the crisis only `` slowly '' .
In addition , it would be `` very difficult '' in two or three years `` work to make '' - basic surviving the banks .
This one punishes the interest margins even if he assumes that passed on the risk premiums which must pay banks and Sparkassen for her emissions for the receipt of liquidity already become the price for loans as a compensation for fading profit margins on , the war around liabilities will drop - -- .
`` The topics liquidity and financing are in structural type and they will put pressure on the loans . ''
`` We have not turned off the tap but the interest differentials are very high '' , Guardiola admitted .
Banesto already distributed the order to her network of branches , limit the award of long-term loans and increase the interest differentials ( cf . Cinco Días of November 22nd and 27th ) on Thursday .
The manager also admitted , the banks were pursuing the strategy at the moment `` to increase the charges '' though `` within a frame embossed by the competition '' .
Sabadell 's central plan based on an organic growth , even if the group , like always , business not excludes corporate .
He for free does not insure , that `` larger enterprises are necessary '' in Spain
He assures `` everything will change next year '' .
He emphasizes that the need for capital `` increases enormously '' at present and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions in red numbers will slip .
He thinks the FROB can replace the money market at cape Titan run interruptions .
He insures after , that Sabadell also can survive a temporary shutdown of the markets , he invalidates the argument of some bankers who already prophesies a new liquidity crisis .
He emphasizes one can take nothing to circulation but as opposed to the occurrences in June , one can obtain a short-term financing over repo business and intercept the crisis with that .

Second mandate : The notoriousness
De Gaulle really had stopped short .
Mitterand had had thought that he stops short .
Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitation Valéry Giscard this ' .
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than this .
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one .
The current leader becomes ergo be a candidate in 2012 .
But the notoriousness stands the side of the mystery which sticks to the presidency function to face not well .
Therefore one must pretend to be from this time on .
In the one and in the other meaning .
In 2006 the supporters provided Jacques Chiracs , a third mandate is not excluded without believing even in it .
On November 15th Nicolas Sarkozy insured in serious clay , his decision , to meet `` sometime in autumn of the year 2011 '' .
The perspective of `` two mandates '' would have been touched on , therefore had spread a little feverishness for the UMP parliamentarians that he on the Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of .
Was this the official announcement of his candidature ?
Far from it .
The president had reminded merely that the constitutional amendment of 2008 restricts the number of five-year terms of office to merely two .
He made an observation , no announcement .
It is not the first time that he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone .
He explained in July 2009 `` you still have at the worst sifting no half years with me or at best '' to them .
On a new one in May 2010 : `` Do not think that I do not think after that about the phase . ''
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him the candidate any more than on the day before ; but also much .
They should cause comments , then for a double reason .
The acceleration of the race around the candidature with the hp on a side .
However , the taking up of the competition with Ségolène Royal which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to it does not have to be revealed to herself .
On the contrary , it is his obvious candidature in 2012 , this one , the hp early than assumed admonish many members for the declaration of war .
The bad surveys on the other side .
For the first time the electors of the right would become the one of Nicolas Sarkozy 46 % against 44 % according to the survey of the BVA l a candidature of François Fillon express ( ' ) prefer .
`` We have a candidate , `` and there are no discussions about it with the UMP , the environment of the prime minister reacted immediately and carefully .
A defeat as possible would `` if he , he would not be a candidate `` , Jean-Pierre Raffarin informs be .
`` He always will think to be able to win '' , Alain Juppé who has accepted the notoriousness corrects .

Police operations in China get gentler
Like a training officer Tang Shenbin strode over a municipal Square , checked his nervous subordinates and assigned with military authority and muffled voice orders .
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China 's robust guardians of the municipal order , dreaded and disdained for her arbitrary raids and her tendency towards the force - to impress the spectators .
`` Stand upright ! ''
`` Look straight ahead ! ''
`` Shows them `` , he whispered to them , `` girls are that way as pretty ! ''
Four girl out of hardly whom teenager ages grow , with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood tightly .
Four pairs of black pumps suited in even row .
Four proper hats sat on the hair held with blue whitely striped bows perfectly .
`` They look average for me '' , Mr Tang remarks contemptuously .
`` Models are pretty . ''
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China 's town inspectors up .
All new applicants must have a degree in a town .
The province Guangdong imported a brightly blue uniform instead of the grey-green ones .
Wuhan in middle China replaced force by low rigid : 50 officials orbited a snack car not built duly according to reports in 2009 and stared at the operator until this packed and left the place after half an hour .
Xindu , a municipal district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants , would like to change the image fundamentally .
13 women strengthen the municipal police patrols since 2003 . You were special selected due to her appearance , her good figure and her youth .
You shall award a softer , feminine aspect to the coarse police .
But unfortunately Scarlett Johansson would hardly manage to improve the bad picture which the Chinese of these town commands have , too .
With right , so the critics .
With the help of fines or other administrative punishments officials only succeed with the municipal laws different from the police be allowed to these .
But the Chinese media show routinely another picture .
In January 2008 , officials beat in the province Hubei spectators unite to death , as this she filmed with his mobile telephone as they suppressed a protest against a garbage dump .
Last year a training manual of the inhabitants of Beijing was stolen to officials and published on the Internet . Into this you describe as offenders can be thrashed without bloodsheds .
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered from brain injuries after a scuffle with five officials .
One , video game being bursting shows in front of force in China that trained official at an attack on street vendors can be downloaded from the Internet .
`` Chengguan frightens the government '' , the national newspaper China Daily moaned last year after further controversies regarding the tactics .
The newspaper required a `` really thorough cleaning '' .
Sceptics find the present approach to be clear insufficiently .
When the district was looking for eight female recruits by advertisement in October , an editorial asked the question into the Beijing Evening New , whether the women would have real tasks or only shall serve as a visual diversion .
Probably two .
According to the job advertisement women were looked for in the age from 18 to 22 with a good figure and `` harmonious features '' .
You should be tall above average more than 1.5 m or 5 feet , 2 1/2 custom .
The employment relation ends with reaching the 26th year of life .
According to the officials the activity is physically too exhausting for women over 25 .
An unnamed district official said `` the most important is her image '' at the virtually government web page Rednet.com on .
`` Whether the candidates get the job depends on her outward appearance like size , weight , first , features etc.. ''
Temperament and `` inner qualities '' then come .
`` Female Chengguan are like flower vases '' , he said and added `` but furthermore they still have other duties '' .
Zheng Lihua , acting leader of the municipal authority of the district , would not like to agree with this description ,
however , admitted that are not not usual into job advertisements for a both sex in China size specifications .
The same applies to even features .
Whether this has to be equated with a good appearance is controversial in China .
But people with handicaps or physical distortions do not need to apply .
`` Unfortunately , we can not use any lame or humpbacks here '' , so Mr Zheng
`` Your image would not be good . ''
One approaches Liu Yi , this one cloister patrols , 22 is , has apple cheeks and a well formed mouth on Baoguang square .
She does not find it sexist that value is so big attached to her appearance .
Finds you `` , I see in this uniform sexily ? '' she asks with an ironic look .
21-year-old Xu Yang , we `` have '' the task of representing the image of the town your colleague with the dimples , this one . , commented
According to your details they are not sorry for the short attitude since they would have more ambitious career plans than easy to shoo only dealers away through the lanes to prevent her from the business .
The patrol deals every morning approx . twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and as possible tofu dishes on foot or on the bicycle before they are chased away .
`` Mr Wang , disappear here , please . ''
We `` have '' already so often told this to you ! Ms . Xu explains to a dealer who had fled on foot and had let his down on a bicycle cart 's fastened noodle kitchen temporarily .
Sound of the officials is the activity rather monotonously as exhausting .
This one explains to Huang Jing , 20 , in the leisure time 's sales nature educatedly `` the same is almost every day '' .
`` All routine . ''
It is a reason for it that the female officials may not confiscate the goods of the dealers like her male colleagues .
You only can threaten offenders to notify her male supervisors of her .
She shall protect this from public hostilities to which officials are frequently exposed in China .
Hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming , the capital of the province Yunnan , kicked up a row this year , the rumour circulated , Chengguan officials would have killed a dealer after .
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly occurrence , 14 government vehicles were knocked over or set on fire .
Xindu escaped from such force riots till now .
But disturbances can not be excluded .
Only two blocks removed of quiet Baonguang Square at which the female officials patrolled in this morning assembled more than 50 persons at a corner of the street .
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle , instead of this contrary to the regulations on the pavement was repaired in a workshop .
The owner shouted blue murder .
After a 15-minute hesitation the officials forced the way to her vehicles with a furious face and continued with the motorcycle and his owner .
Li Xuedong , 40 , a coordinator of the male patrol stayed behind . He turned his white nameplate over to remain anonymous .
The coordinators - men over 40 - play colleagues a role supporting purely as hers .
Presenting a clean image but they were not trained in this .
`` Sometimes we proceed verbally . ''
Mr Li `` sometimes but also physically '' explains rationally .
`` People begin most time with the quarrel . ''

Talent fight for high-potentials
There is an active crowd at the Buffet .
16 students crowd around salmon roll , tomato soup and sweet .
The technical University of Brunswick and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop .
In a kind of competition of ideas they shall talk shop over the car of the future , and get to know Volkswagen quite at the same time together with VW developers .
In the competition around the cleverest heads many enterprises go in the close combat meanwhile and back cooperations with the universities like VW .
Your mission : Recruiting the most talented graduates in the lecture rooms as early as possible before they come onto the labour market and are courted of other .
And because the universities do not return any lists about the performances of her students , one tries the exception talents in practice projects to espy and at himself to bind .
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Brunswick the car manufacturing group solicits the talents .
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens , jellybaby and briefcases with VW logo .
She tells to the hopeful young talents of traineeship programmes and student jobs and shows them ways to the group open .
Nico Selle of the TU Brunswick looks after the project with VW .
He sees the advantages for the two sides : `` The students get in contact to the industry and gain experience . ''
`` VW can get to know students simultaneously , looks at interesting candidates more nearly and wonders who would be considered as employee . ''
Such cooperations , are not unusual , so Selle .
It is that the students are wooed um so offensively new .
`` Otherwise the main emphasis rather was on the technical project '' , says Selle .
The fight for the graduated freshly probably will get even harder .
The enterprises can not choose her employees from a large crowd of applicants in many lines of business any more .
But they must extol themselves and perform the courtship display particularly around highly qualified workers .
Primarily graduates from the engineer disciplines are at it in an excellent negotiating position .
Engineers VDI stayed sound with the association of Germans over 40.000 engineer places unoccupiedly in October .
And the so-called engineer gap will get even bigger according to the VDI forecasts .
For the auditing and service company KPMG novel goes Dykta on the talent hunting .
He organizes effortful Recruiting events , such as the KPMG-Race , a kind of modern paper-chase at which the participants must find her way with GPS coordinates .
The enterprise wants to send students the USA straight through eight promising about next year .
Being able to quite at the same time look the participants at KPMG branch offices and get to know the enterprise .
Who may , makes up his mind into two choice rounds in the front-end ?
The cream de flies La cream of the many applicants only to the USA .
The guns get hit and sharp pain around the High still bigger potential at universities according to the Dykta .
`` We want to stand out with the Race from the mass . ''
`` Only a simple cruise was us too some . ''
For talent hunters Dykta the invoice seems to work out even .
`` We have contact with all participants of a similar action to this day last year . ''
Some `` stand shortly before her degree and want to apply to us soon '' , he says .
Primarily small and medium-sized enterprises go also quite classically besides wooing directly at the campus at professional fairs on the stalk .
`` We try to reach graduates on trade fairs . ''
Sitha Stübe , personnel manager at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld , reports `` approximately on this one inter solar `` .
The Bonn enterprise employs about 1500 employees in Germany .
Stübe knows of the young difficulties .
At present , 35 jobs are posted on the enterprise web site .
`` It is just very hard to fill vacant positions . ''
`` This takes a lot of the time and money '' , she says .
Longer way is the contact over the university professors .
Solarworld cooperates with different universities , approximately the university in Freiberg .
`` The professors give indications that one can make traineeships or write his master thesis with us . ''
Expensive advertising campaigns are not planned with the solar specialist .
For this the enterprise tries to advertise itself with other advantages : Friendly atmosphere , flat hierarchies and slight communication .
`` A large combine often can not offer this '' , says personnel manager Stübe .
Money does not play the leading role in the job hunting any more .
Flexible working times , child care or good opportunities for advancement are broader decisive factors .
Solarworld ranked 55th at a study of the Great Place to Work institute among the 100 best employers of Germany .
The institute makes an annual list of the best of German employers .
To this it questions employees are she with her work and her job environment as content and looks on the framework conditions for the employees .
Personnel manager Stübe also hopes for advantages of the placing with the job seekers .
`` I think that applicants look particularly after external assessments over a potential employer '' , she says .
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer branding academy advises enterprises which want to build up a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy .
He recommends his customers more authenticity .
And this means primarily internal measures according to the Kriegler .
`` The best way to make oneself attractive as an employer leads across the employees of its own '' , he says .
The internal Employer branding , that is employer brand formation within the staff of one 's own , is called in the industry-specific jargon .
`` Content employees are the best ambassadors . ''
If one treats his people well and they identify themselves with the enterprise then they completely would of alone with friends and acquaintances advertise her employer .
`` This is like a game with gang '' , says Kriegler .

Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in finals , he has on this and in his career anti-lock braking system experiences but he played decisive games three times .
In addition , in the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final two styles which are different and provided by her respective coaches contrast with themselves and the meeting indicated by contrasts is reflected in the results .
Rubén Omar Romano looks back in finals , at three defeats he is open on this and anti-lock braking system in his career experienced but three times has he had decisive games and has he kept himself good till now why this opportunity of quite special importance for him is .
The Argentine has exaggerated himself with the medallion to the second Champion , he is unite step stayed behind the winners and he has amazingly delivered successive finals with the same team .
The first final as a coach reached 'Torneo aperture 2002 ' the statistical strategist when del Morelia with which he learned a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2 had the reins in his hand ; he reached the decisive duel later at the 'Clausura 2003 ' which he lost against Rayados also with 3-1 .
Already with Santos Laguna Rubén had to plug a setback in again on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010 ' at which they played against Lo 's Diabolos , the match with 2-2 undecidedly ended against Lo 's Choriceros after 210 minutes of play but he made progress at the penalty kick with 3-1 and did two possibilities of plugging his title in but in the end inappropriate three of his players the eleven steps good and the game turned to 4-3 since .
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diabolos Rojos and one with Monterrey , his big rival . Therefore he would not like to be pursued by the accident once again and escape from the bad magic to be able to celebrate a title for the first time although he confirms that for him the most important is the game itself .
`` I would like to become champion , I would not like to break statistics , this is for a club for my affection to which I devote myself , `` and therefore the title will come to me but what happens before is the most important , the first mate commented when one questions him about the lost finals .
He still has had the last final left in the memory strongly to have he learned from it insured , much : `` The only lesson which we can draw from this is , that till the arbitrator does not whistle the end , we can not celebrate , we are prepared at the line , the players , also , and I think to leave because we were already prepared for it with two penalty kicks the last time that this is a teaching , is not ended to the game , there is no reason for celebrating . ''
Do not know that this series by sudden-death play-off could be decided him , worried , because he trusts his players : `` One wants never to arrive at the sudden-death play-off , one would like to complete in the regular season but this left a message saying for us a little for this final sometimes there is no alternative and one must be prepared for it , sometimes we were prepared tour in the previous one but unfortunately , destiny prepared us a bad game because of nervousness or the intense efforts to hold the title in the hands already and we hope that it will not come to that this time . ''
Power lies to be no longer only second champion and to cost the glory for the first time which the titles possess in Romans .

Plzen floor fund - arrests of the police at a public advertising
The anti corruption police carried out arrests in the building of the floor fund in Plzen within the last few days .
The local medium businessman and real estate agents Lubos G. of the private investigators became had a laxative effect into handcuffs .
This had tried allegedly to manipulate a public competition just taking place for the carrying out of claims for restitution so that the properties offered in the competition fell to a concrete interested party .
This shall have paid Lubos G. half a million for this .
The Plzen public prosecutor 's office of the newspaper `` Právo '' I only can `` '' confirm at this time that the police follow a person because of the crime of deceitful wheelings and dealings at a public competition , Antonie Zelená said , she can not broader details grant with regard to the regular examinations , the boss .
The 46-year-old businessman was dismissed by the police again 24 hours later .
How he manipulate the public competition could , about this can one speculate only in view of the scanty official information ?
The spokeswoman of the floor fund Lubomír Cerná led on the question of Právo regarding this , this one police actually have arrests carried out and this during a public competition in the Plzen extension of the floor fund .
`` It was all about a client and not at all all about one of our employees '' , she put in concrete terms .
The public competition had the correct name `` request for the tendering of claims to the transportation of properties in accordance with the floor law '' according to Mrs Cerná and would take place in cases in which several applicants on show the offered property interest .
`` These persons offer a higher value of her claims for restitution to be settled by the assignment in the context of the request than the exclaimed real estate value . ''
`` The order of the potential buyers is limited according to the offered claims , the floor fund then transfers the property to the person with the highest supply '' , explains the spokeswoman of the fund .
Obviously information was at Lubos G. 's disposal , who applied because of the request had and he was alone authorized person there , had there he bought a number of claims for restitution for himself , he offered one real-estate interests that he retires from the competition .
Obviously compensation greases against one .
This also would be an adequate explanation why he had such a large amount of money on him at his arrest .
Lubos G. already had contacts too good in the past to the Plzen floor fund .
So he played Václav Sankota who was followed criminally because he returned properties into substitute restitutions to which location decisions had already been made to building schemes a role also in the Causa of the former boss of the floor fund .
Lubos G. purchased for example properties by the floor fund at that time which were intended for the making of public streets in the place , too , said more exactly , where the making of the access main transport line to the commercial district Borské polarizes planned was .
Later , he exchanged these for a house very favourably with the municipal authorities directly in the historical centre of the town which far exceeded the value of the properties .
Giving in must reluctantly the city hall at that time to not endanger the building scheme by the blocking of the properties .

To the hell , warrior !
Does splatter match the art cinema ?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs old genre limits newly with his fighter epic poem `` valhalla Rising '' .
To which audience may the Danish director have commemorated Nicolas Winding Refn when he has turned `` valhalla Rising '' ?
A captured Viking warrior with only an eye ( Mads Mikkelsen ) escapes from his torturers and puts on his opponents with almost superhuman strengths in rows , sounds ideal for young male spectators on the search for a bloody action just because our hero likes to make use of violent killing methods and tears the intestines for his enemies from the live body , if he has spleen .
On the other hand one eye says what he is called actual , the whole film about no word , and the other figures let themselves be carried away to one or two sentences or a couple of painful death cries at the most , too .
Otherwise they are being silent and indulging oneself in the horrifyingly beautiful hilly country of Scotland which offers the scenery to the Viking world of about one thousand years ago .
Ideal rather for adult cineastes with interest for existentialism and very quiet tracking shot .
When a film has several target groups , only harm beautifully , if they exclude each other .
Director Winding Refn is regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy `` pusher '' , however , refuses stoically to make the mainstream or a little less brutality his works approachable to the type House in a little more good humour .
Most art cinema friends might let themselves be deterred of the brain mass splashing around and the intestines .
At the latest , the action fans die then before boredom if one eye breaks ship open to Jerusalem and pins an eternity into calm and fog for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via before the team arrives in America and is further silent there apparently .
No miracle therefore , that `` valhalla Rising '' has not found any cinema rental company and has appeared only on DVD now in Germany .
This is a misery particularly because of the splendid pictures but this also has merited attention a little because a piece of cinema irritating now and then hides behind the pretentious till bloody façade .
In this film it is not all about dialogs or a stringent action , it is all film become atmosphere , one feverish dream .
And from this there is no escape for the spectator .
Refn which is him faced from the hearts of the figures is glad for him to have hardly a moment of the diversion and ties up him the throat with his icy pictures and the dark trance like soundtrack quite slowly , primarily but with the incomprehensible hate .
Only a little fair-haired boy one eye faithfully aside suits which , keep something like innocence , all others are driven by anger .
Himself the one-eyed hero , his motives are never explained , however , this one is to the warrior from the hell for enemies and temporarily allies sometime possibly at the one most of all to the ambassador of the devil .
He means ruin perhaps but also for the anyway bad only ones .
`` Valhalla Rising '' is irritate and astonishment a mysterious film for annoying which one can hate and admire .
An experience .

Partido Popular won 4 seats in the convention to this and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28th the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida , Tarragona and Barcelona
The PP already suits her look to the important voices and representative increase at the last provincial elections on the parliamentary elections - preferred or not . Your expectations are more than positive because the number of votes which obtains this party in these elections is usually twice as high as this one in the elections in Catalonia .
So the Catalan people 's party got 610.473 votes of 2008 at the parliamentary elections while this number was only 316,222 at the provincial elections in the year 2006 .
Last Sunday obtained the PPC 384.091 votes .
This ascending trend the analysts of the PP should stop , forecast that the PPC from 8 on 12 congressional representative could climb at the parliamentary elections while result of the diversion of the percentage of votes of the PSC and the relationship of the electorate of the PP CiU four ( she has 10 now ) also gains additionally and the PSC would lose at least 9 representatives ( of 25 ) if - -- .
These calculations prove the fundamental significance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE .
In accordance with the analysis of the people 's party the ERC would lose a representative , she at present has three , during ICV keep her representative or gain one additionally could .
If the election calendar should be kept , however , the next appointment with the local elections falls in May 2011 . The people 's party ( PP ) also then can be the tongue at the scales to prepare the socialist dominance an end and to be more precise in four provincial capitals and with her majority in the town council of Barcelona , one of the municipal authorities with the largest household : 661 million euros for 2011 .
Both the nationalists and the people 's party agree on it , that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona , Tarragona , Lérida and Gerona in which the socialists can neither achieve a majority nor go back to her traditional allies ( ERC and ICV ) .
After the republican debacle it is not erroneous that this party will lose her representation in the district council of Barcelona in whom she must achieve 5 % of the votes .
The PP recorded an increase of her percentage of votes , however , in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive strength in Barcelona , Lérida and Tarragona .
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the leading role in Tarragona 's reversal . There they had ruled over PP together with which in front of the present mayor , Joseph Félix ball ester .
En Lérida lies the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC . The mayor , Àngel Ros , maintains good relations to Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met repeatedly .
Also in other important places , such as in Badalona , Castelldefels or Reus could the people 's party record an important increase .
At present , the PP is represented into 34 municipal authorities of Catalonia and strives for the formation of lists in as many places as possible .

American soldiers have a new `` intelligent weapon '' .
The American troops have for the first time used a new `` intelligent '' weapon in Afghanistan which is well-known to XM 25 only under her code term till now .
In her favour balance of power moves to the conflict there with the Taliban influenced and this hope for the generals that this new automatic weapon .
Something like that , like a super exact cannon , is the new weapon .
Your projectiles are steered by only some few metres namely by lasers with an accuracy in the aim .
The special projectiles of calibre of 25 mm which were developed and contain a highly explosive explosive for this gun work practically like little shells .
The projectiles can be programmed so that they can not only explode at the impact on the aim but at an arbitrary point of her ballistic flight path .
This means one can use her against an enemy behind an obstacle - a wall this one or himself hides in the trench .
From above he is so rain of steel splinters of above usually can not easily set him protectedly , the dreadful one namely out of action .
Which participated in the development of the XM 25 , the new fight gun is the first infantry weapon which makes use of `` intelligent '' technologies according to Richard Audett .
`` The soldier proceeds basically so : He envisages the aim and sends out a laser beam , which determines the distance , does he win an exact visor point so after which he corrects the rise angle , then needs to squeeze he only .
`` We say one has measured 543 m . ''
`` If one pulls the trigger , the weapon becomes charged one , two or three metres and the projectile shits on the distance 543 metres plus minus .

An election defeat
Nobody had expected the elections to want to be perfect in Haiti on November 28th .
But the facts surpassed the fears of the polling officers who hurried for the shaken country for the help by far .
Overcrowded ballot boxes , votes cast repeatedly , polling cards were only a part of the problems in the gutter , destroyed polling stations and intimidations .
Polling stations opened with a delay lasting several hours .
Many Haitians from whom many had got homeless by the earthquake in January roamed on the search for a choice around .
Some finally completely gave up .
A dozen candidates for the presidency under this reconcile presumed leaders , required the abolition of the election results due to an alleged deceit .
It came to partly violent protests in the whole country .
Edmond Mulet , the leader of the UN mission in Haiti , nevertheless described the election as quite good `` in many interests '' .
According to a careful statement of observers of the organisation of American States and of The Caribbean Community these irregularities `` do not '' make trial invalid necessarily as seriously as they may be also .
Into other word , The show Goes on .
The election authority which allegedly is obliged to the unpopular departing president René Préval and his candidate , Jude Célestin , will announce the temporary results on December 7th .
The expected final ballot is arranged for January .
There still is hope in the election .
The two leading opposition candidates , the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former roof ridge Lady Girlande Manigat have withdrawn her initial invalidity complaint .
If Jude Célestin who meets with the electors ' only little or not the slightest approval explained to the final ballot by the election authority to the winner , this could lead to problems .
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 m. of the earthquake victims still live in tents a low poll was feared .
Many Haitians were prevented from the voting by lacking organisation on the election day .
Identity cards which are needed to the election were not distributed approx . 250.000 yet shortly before start of pulsing .
Much is at stake .
The donor countries regard a legitimate , recognized government as an important step at the reconstruction of Haiti .
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion .

Ogoniland has burned down
The water in the rivers is ölbraun , it smells like at the filling station : Billions litres of crude oil run out have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland .
The people live on theft , corruption and illegal Ölkochen .
Celestine Akpobari means it well .
Do not be troubled the environmental activist calms the journalists `` as of `` : `` Today , you still will get enough sludge in front of the lentil . ''
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed up the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to the chest in the water with the striations surrounding him : In the rainbow-coloured water gleam the scene seems almost pretty .
It can be not seen that brown crude oil clouds float under the surface .
She in the past has in bucketfuls collected prawns here , Esther Badom says on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty river .
The sluggish running waters are completely bleak by now .
Five years ago vast amounts crude oil flowed from a burst pipe into the gigantic wetland .
Fishermen from this near situated small towns Bodo must paddle now six hours to reach waters containing fish : The Ogoniland lain in the heart of the Niger delta is regarded as one of the regions of the world polluted worst .
On the journey by the mangrove marshes run through by courses of a river the whole extent of the devastation gets conspicuous .
The motorboat stirs brown broth up , place who dips his hand into the water , pulls oily fingers out bright water .
The roots of the little mangroves rise like black liquorice bars from the ground sadly , palms to be found have her fly whisks occasionally hung .
As otherwise they are usual in wetlands one searches in vain swarms of birds : As soon as the outboard motor is silent , ghostly quiet spreads herself in the earlier paradise smelling like a filling station .
`` What happens here an ecological warfare is '' , Celestine Akpobari says darkly : `` We live in permanent danger for the health . ''
The war comparison is appropriate .
The housing area of the Ogoni is a battlefield disputed for decades : Here the first discoverers penetrated more ago than 60 years from Europe , the first resistance organized himself with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa executed later here in the eighties , here the Shell group 1993 had to discontinue his production because it got too dangerous for the oil workers .
The return is refused to the enterprise to Ogoniland certainly today : The oil fields are fallowly , too unstably located in the Ogoniland the situation is for the group while more than two million barrel of the black gold are pumped out by the triple size of Switzerland with over 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipes daily from the complete delta region .
Steel racks like bizarre sculptures rise all couple of one hundred metres from the water : `` Little Christmas trees '' become far too tenderly the heads of the drill holes called .
You are corroded to the core up to 50 year oldly , the usually one .
Akpobari thinks such a drill chuck breaks from each other again and again , a constant current crude oil then runs into the water .
More than two billion litre have flowed after expert estimates into the ecosystem of the delta within 50 years : How at the accident of the super tanker `` Exxon Valdez '' into the sea she insisted year for year the lot oil - one the greatest ecological disasters in the history of mankind 21 years ago in front of Alaska .
Who for the continuous environmental district responsibly be made can , about this is argued ?
While the Shell group is holding the pollution sabotage and the oil theft organized responsible for more than 90 per cent , environmentalists consider bursting drill chucks and leaky pipelines main causes .
Shell lays out considerably lower standards of security in Nigeria as or else in the world usual , the U.S. scientist Richard Steiner reproached the group 2008 : Alone the instalment of defects at the pipes is `` around a multiple higher than elsewhere `` .
Shapes appear from the mangroves at a place which looks like a deserted , oil-smeared workshop under a free sky from the distance : You are stark-nakedly and up to the neck oil-smeared .
A fire flickers under one of the many barrels which can be agreed with tubes scattered connectedly , partly arbitrarily on the area partly : An illegal little refinery .
Michael , the boss of the group , explains the crude oil is heated up over the fire in the barrel for several hours .
Petrol penetrates through the pipes into the on-catch pot first , drips kerosene and finally diesels out later at the end of the line .
So Michael and four employees produce litres up to four barrels of diesel at 300 each daily : This earns us 34.000 Naira one `` - about 22 dollars `` .
The delta residents use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest mineral oil state of Black Africa .
Nigeria only has one single refinery at its disposal .
This one still be able to the illegal cookers undercut with almost 40 eurocents per litre of ridiculously low diesel price : Because they get her raw material for free .
He is from `` bunker ships '' which tap the pipeline net straight through Ogoniland : This way be lost to the country at least 16 million litre of crude oil lost daily according to the experts in the complete Niger delta .
Only an insignificantly small portion of the raw material stored provisionally is refined illegally , though : Organized criminal networks fill the lion 's share , to which and high-profile also politician shall belong , into tankers armed force and get rid of him on the world market .
The debate rather haunted this one , whether the ecological disaster is owed to the population or the lax production way , the activist regards Akpobari as pure academically .
`` The petroleum companies would not be perceived as intruders and they would not have destroyed the basic living conditions of the fishermen so thoroughly , there would be sabotage still theft and illegal refineries . ''
The relationship of the Ogoni is destroyed primarily so meanwhile , however , to Shell that only a discount of the group would be possible : `` Perhaps yes other nationalities like the Chinese than better prove . ''
Michael gets nervous there .
The muscular Ölmann says `` high time , that you disappear `` .
`` The soldiers can come every minute . ''
Although if the illegal oil refiners of the special squad of the defense forces are caught , no arrest , well but a painful bribe , threatens them .
The soldiers principally being from the country north also want to profit from the raw material like all Nigerians .
`` These damned things have taken our country to the dog in every regard '' , says Akpobari .

Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum is beer outly , it simply seems too slow
Fernet , rum and vodka , for once also one good whisky which one has stolen the father from the home bar .
These are the drinks after whose pleasure drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen must be most frequently need treated .
Children who must sleep off her hangover repeated in the hospital are not an exception .
This results from the experiences of doctors which are confronted with similar cases in the photo of the children 's departments of clinical complexes .
`` Beer or wine is complete out of fashion because it simply lasts too long until one is drunk . ''
`` Today 's trend is obviously hard alcohol '' , said Právo Ludek Pelikán , the senior consultant of the children 's department in the central bohemian clinic Horovice .
`` Father steals a bottle from the home bar whisky , if it turns out well , this , and if not , then at least Fernet or vodka .
Vodka has `` he then does not smell the advantage so strongly that one can mix him with Juice `` , the senior consultant explains .
The spokeswoman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him properly .
`` It most frequently is all about Fernet or rum . ''
`` This is today 's alcohol trend , by name to primary schools . ''
`` Felt '' occasional also around slivovitz which one takes along from home , Mrs Jurinová led .
According to senior consultant Pelikán thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are not an exception in the admission to a hospital already .
For ten years , in front of the clinic he was the hospital Motol in the paediatrics department in Horovice on which he has worked since this year active , where the ambulances handed in inebriated pupils from far and wide .
`` A girl had to be hospitalized four times . ''
`` She started with your career with 12 years when she was delivered to combination with `` ecstasy '' the first time with 3.5 alcohol levels of alcohol in the blood and still to this '' , the doctor described a particularly difficult case .
`` She was in the exhibition grounds in Holesovice on any dance party . ''
`` The interesting did that it did not seem strange to her mother at all , the senior consultant is surprised that her daughter did not come home for 48 hours `` .
Definitely the missing interest of the parents or its unbelievable tolerance when clinking glasses with the offspring of one 's own is regarded as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children .
About a real dependence in the true sense of the word it is not according to experts with children .
`` Under alcoholism it is a long-standing chronic dependence of the alcohol to understand phenomenon with all thus coherent ones and this is not the case with these children . ''
At the ones who enjoys alcohol repeated a negative family social background is `` , characteristic mostly senior consultant Pelikán explains .
According to the spokeswoman of the hospital Motol , Mrs Jurinová November was introduced to the local department of children and youth medicine about forty drunken children by middle .
However only the cases with a heavy alcoholic poisoning which required a stay in hospital have influence on the statistics .
Drunken children who are taken after outpatient treatment of the parents or if necessary of the police home are not registered .
There are in opinion of Mr Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes on which relying one hundred per cent is apart from the cases in which children only finish such a bottle of schnapps in the school desk : Walpurgis Night , New Year 's Eve and the end of the school year .
`` The last-named for two reasons either out of sorrow because of the bad testimonial or out of joy until the holidays . ''
`` I have already experienced seven drunken children in the photo '' in the Walpurgis Night suddenly , too , emphasizes Doctor Pelikán .
It is turn of a drunken child who spends the night under a medical supervision paradoxically better than a child who only has to fight with an unpleasant hangover the next day .
One can sell the headaches in the morning after that namely which are due to the dehydrogenation and due to the glucose defect with a liquid donating infusion with glucose and nutrients which the organism lacks in the hospital .
`` You it is obviously better because wake after the `` marvellous '' experience in the evening , her up with a good mood without something being aching someplace . ''
`` You are only a little confused about it where they are '' , Doctor Pelikán fills , in which he spoils the patients ' good mood through this at least from time to time by listing the costs for them which she will cost the treatment .
One because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed like to come well on couple of umpteen one thousand crowns .
`` I have used this as an education means now and then which , if I have reckoned up for the children directly at the visit , her drunkenness has cost Doctor Pelikán added and money earn around which for one single such party that it can absolutely that they must work over all the holidays happen `` .
Gripping the health insurance companies however not according to recourse methods in his opinion , calling in the inebriated children 's necessary costs of the parents around which for the cure .

PP demands a postponement of the tax agreement of Mas
The chairwoman the PPC , Alicia Sánchez-Camacho , took the opportunity yesterday to present her conditions concerning the support of his assumption of office 's post as a prime minister the Generalitat to Artur Mas personally . These are not different from the already put during the election campaign and can be summarized by regionalist independence adventures , like a finance compensation agreement which the regionalist leader wants to suggest on the highlight of his mandate , with the priority of the economic recovery and refraining .
The chairwoman of the Catalan people 's party turned with the safety to Artur Mas which the 18 representatives awarded to her which had won her , a number which is more than sufficing last Sunday to feel indispensable . Of the civil regionalist party CiU is dependent on it that one of the opposition parties abstains from the vote at least at the coordination at his assumption of office 's post because the candidate .
The future alliances which want to come in the regionalists at the coming parliamentary elections in the convention depend on a possible entente with the PP . The conversations , the Mas at the moment with the other party leaders leads , concern Catalonia , though .
What the party leader of the PPC concerns `` all discourses which concerns the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia '' as well as an agreement on the financial adjustment between state and the independents ' region , this demands so that be , turned on behind the party leader of CiU similarly wants to subject to referendum like in the Basque region and this one - to the support of the assumption of office 's post .
Both political leaders have in common that they make the regional administration the political apparatus blown out slimmer and want to abolish the inheritance and present tax .
Deal with the details of the negotiations on Mas assumption of office 's post on the part of the PPC Jordi cornet and labor pain Montserrat .
Mas already have himself and met Joan Herrera ( ICV ) with Joaquim Nadal ( PSC ) , this one announced a hard opposition . He will come together with Joan Puigcercós ( ERC ) , Albert Rivera ( Ciutadans ) and Joan Laporta ( solid artillery deed Catalina ) today .

Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes 81 different chemical substances over the day , such a study published by the union Générations Futures ( former movement of generations coming to the protection of the rights and the respect ) this Wednesday .
The union which explains this one normally had between July and September within four that her results `` do not represent statistically significant value but represent illustration character of the treated difficulties in view of the low number of analysed samples '' , food consumed plus a snack between meals bought in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris from an approximately ten-year-old child for the meals .
These typical meals , inclusive of the official recommendations of five fresh fruit parts , three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day , were examined just like nibblings of laboratories on the search for chemical substances , pesticides , heavy metals and other pollutants .
The plate balance sheets are shattering : 81 chemical substances , and five carcinogenically classified just like 37 substances with endocrine interference factor loudly when sure studies of several institutions , such as the international cancer research centre , under this 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenic classified .
`` One takes so very well that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to possibly carcinogenic substances with endocrine interference factor is alarming even if the legal limits are not exceeded for every substance in approximate all the cases which is chemical and taken individually from this elevation '' , remarks the union .
Already at the breakfast alone the butter and the tea already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic delays and of three for certain proved , just like more than twenty delays which can impair the hormone system with milk as carcinogenic .
When snack between meals provided for the study the apple imported from Brazil shows traces of six chemical substances , under forbidden to this one in France fungicide .
The same applies to the string beans at which the study has locked traces of an insecticide forbidden strictly in the EU from Kenya , included in the lunch .
Furthermore the hamburger , the tunafish from the tin , alone the baguette and the chewing gum were also larded by pesticides and other chemical substances .
The analyses have brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to the light at the tapwater .
At dinner the salmon steak was with 34 determined , chemical delays of the `` most extensive '' and alone the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave up was not unloaded .
The end finite risk of this `` pollutant cocktail '' for the consumer probably `` is '' , so undervalued the study .
`` Alliance Europe technology Les Verts '' ( EE-LV ) has suggested `` in view of the urgency of the situation '' for her part to introduce a moratorium about the use of pesticides to stop the `` increase to illnesses caused by civilization '' .
A study of the European authority had reference to the presence of delays of 365 different , pesticides identified into fruit and vegetables identified , which are consumed in Europe , among this 76 , for food safety ( EFSA ) into corn in July .

Vindictive hackers and busy spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning .
On a side she has this one turned out to be an obvious scandal merely a scandal is hypocrisy in the Sinner , the relations between the states , the citizens and the Presse ruled over which , a scandal .
On the other side she announces profound changes on international standard and gives a foretaste for the future dominated by regression .
But we follow the row .
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any file ( an any old nation ) prepared by a secret service consists exclusively of newspaper cuttings .
The `` extraordinary '' , American uncoverings about the sexual habits of Berlusconi throw nothing off further than this , sketches what one anyway got in every any old journal over months to read ( the owner is Berlusconi apart from these ) and the image of Gaddafis caricatured alarmingly offered cabaret artists substance for hers already for long time .
The rule according to which the secret dossiers only may consist of already known news is not essentially the secret services and this for the dynamics only in this century .
If you go to a library which devotes itself to esoteric publications , every work will recognize you , that ( about the grail , the mystery of Rennes-Le chateau , the Templars or the rosicrucians ) this exactly repeats what was already written in previous works .
This does not come alone , that the author of occult texts does not want to publish enquiries ( still therefore , that he would not know , news about this could not be found where existing ) , but because those which devotes himself to the occultism believe in nothing different from it she already known what and confirmed what they have already learned .
This is also Dan Brown 's success mechanism .
As well the secret files .
Bad and bad ( or limited mind ) is the informer the boss of the secret service also is ( he could otherwise what also always be , for example editor at Libération ) , this one only considers to be true what he appreciates .
The same as those , were the top Secret information about Berlusconi which the American embassy in Rome had sent the state department the week had already the Newsweek published before .
Why so fuss was such a made around the uncoverings of these dossiers ?
Mean on a side what every educated person already knows and to be more precise that the messages have lost her diplomatic function and have changed into spy centres with the exception of some small representation tasks at least be able to call the heads of the government each other or be able to take an aeroplane to meet for dinner .
Any arbitrary spectator of inquiry films knows this very exactly and it does not happen from hypocrisy that one is pretending , to ignore this .
Nevertheless : The fact to repeat it publicly hurts the task of the hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy into a bad light .
In second place : The idea that an any old hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world holds the considerable blow against the prestige of the state department .
Moreover , the scandal of some brings about the sacrifices when rather the `` executioners '' into distress .
But we devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened .
One could bundle all power like a Big Brother who checked every gesture of his subjects formerly at Orwell 's times .
Orwell 's prophecy could have turned out perfect correctly since then where one can check every movement thanks to the telephone , any concluded transaction , the frequented hotel , the chosen motorway and so on ; the citizen would get the power for the total victim of the eye .
Alone the secret crypts of the power can not escape any more from control of a hacker , the inspection round stops being judged one-sided and gets circular so if , however , one makes clear to himself what goes off today that .
The power checks each of citizen but everybody citizen or at least the hacker - chosen as an avenger the citizen , can find the secrets of the power out .
How can hold himself a power which is not able to keep her own secrets any more , however ?
Georg Simmel already said it is correct , an actual secret is an empty secret ( and ) an empty secret can be never revealed that ; it is also true , about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel a secret is liberal secret in the reason since it surrenders the public sphere that each knowledge ; but indicated in the style of WikiLeaks to disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets , rob her of any power .
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong , against this but Clinton and Obama .
What wanting to be the consequences of this insult which was caused to such a tremendous power ?
It is obvious that the states will make information reserved no in future more online , this would amount to a notice stuck up at the corner of the street .
But it is just as obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on telephone secret .
Nothing is simpler but to find out whether and when a leader moves in an aeroplane and has contacted one of his colleagues .
How could private and only meant for certain ears relations be maintained in future ?
I know very well that my forecast sounds like science fiction and like a novel at the moment but I feel forced to imagine the government agents , carrying her communications with himself moving in a secret way busily on uncontrollable routes nowhere else than in the bare memory , and furthermore the few written information which has got her in the heel concealing .
The information would be stored in only copy in locked drawers : In the reason the spying test of Watergate had as WikiLeaks to record less success .
I had the opportunity namely backwards to write that the technology nowadays like a crayfish makes progress .
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized the communication , the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with a ( telephonic ) wire .
The ( analogous ) video cassettes had made it possible to find a film out band for band for the film researchers , by one being able to spool forwards and reveal all secrets of the Mondays from behind while nowadays the ( numeric ) CDs are making nothing else possible but to jump to chapter therefore in macro portions from chapter .
One goes by high-speed trains within three hours of Rome after Milan while this requires hours three and a half by aeroplane including changing .
It therefore is not unusual that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse .
A last observation .
In earlier times tried the Presse to understand what kind of secrets were forged between the messages .
It is the messages , this one confidential information of the Presse demand at present .

Worldwide plan for the renewal of the lights
UNO has suggested a plan in Cancun for the renewal of the illumination of households , trade and industry in 100 countries with regard to the obtainment of a reduction of the greenhouse gas ( CFC ) which almost corresponds to a third of the additional diminution which must be carried out yesterday to stabilize the earth climate to 2020 .
This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of the concrete large-scale projects which hopes around the absence from mandatory diminution obligations of the industrial countries to compensate to convert UNO in Cancun .
According to the plan put forward yesterday the main problem would be avoided in form of the 1.8 billion tons ( Gt ) of the CFC handed in due to the lights on the earth if light-emitting diodes ( LED ) would , the white-hot bulb which represents till now another monopoly from 50 to 70 % on the market or still improve fluorescing by be replacing .
The lights are responsible for 8 % of the worldwide emissions .
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70 % of the waste gases of the worldwide fleet of vehicles .
The great waste gas issuers like the United States , China , Europe and a different one under which Canada also counted which the global CFC emissions of 53 Gt should lower on 49 Gt had committed themselves to doing voluntary diminution plans in Copenhagen last year .
Of these balance sheets one still should remove 5 Gt , however , to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees centigrade of today up to the year 2020 around to prevent that this turns out out of control .
In the white-hot bulbs escapes 95 % of the energy in the form of warmth and the remaining 5 % produce the light .
The energy consumption goes down by 75 % with the compact luminescent material bulbs , with the new LED light bulbs one reduces this energy requirement around the double one again .
The compact luminescent material bulbs hold on average to 10,000 hours between 6000 .
Has has a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and uses up 80 % less energy than a white-hot bulb , what a hint of the one economizing possibilities of the exchange plan arranges which shall be used in 100 countries put the new LED light bulbs , such as those , that one of the manufacturers Philips , on the market this week , this society has by the way taken part in the UNO study .
Besides the fact that these completely new light bulbs only hand in very little warmth they can work also with a rheostat .
And they contain no mercury .
Several specialists has shown , that compact luminescent material pears show reserves , since they contain mercury and that one can dispose of her as a special waste because of what is not always possible in the developing countries unless the producers make a reception available .
The main source to mercury emissions on the planet , however , does not represent the compact luminescent material bulb according to the report but around which electricity rather wasted the coal power stations of the white-hot bulbs which ejects considerably more mercury to produce .
These coal power stations eject 25,000 tons of mercury alone in the United States every year .
The report explains in detail the profits which every country thanks to this international programme would gain .
Indonesia would save such for example a billion dollar at the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2 every year , this means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power stations whose building Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion .

I wish my successors a more peaceful year than we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was taken off by the results of the crisis fast .
Farmet has the worst thanks to his determination behind himself .
Karel Ždárský accepted the price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the year in the former year the owner of the company of Farmet , contrary to .
The jury appreciated the efforts at that time with which he stamped an enterprise from the small tool engineering in Ceská Skalice from the ground which makes hundreds of millions of sales .
`` I can say that this appreciation encourages only me myself but also all my employees and has not confirmed our self-confidence in the fight with the competition '' , says last year 's winner .
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet stood the effort , something to do useful .
And when the state of his father Karel Ždárský then offered a small workshop as a compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists to the lease he did not hesitate for a long time , let his career in the company he till there busy was employed which buzzes and a company of one 's own was based with a couple of comrades of his father to the production of plastic baths .
Short time later started with her to concentrate on plant oil presses .
They are biggest manufacturers of automatic press in whole Central Europe within 18 years climbed to this .
She also has entered the consciousness of the not special public but first by the success in the mentioned competition and its medialization .
Our foreign partners did not also start Karel Ždárský says to be able cooperate with a company which has achieved the greatest possible success in her country the circumstance `` only , that our customers are aware of the brand Farmet considerably more intensively now , to attach greater value `` .
The last year was not only dominated by the victory euphoria at Farmet , though .
The appreciation started out from the economic results of the enterprise in 2008 and a part of 2009 .
And the most difficult year was straight 2009 for the sale of tool engineering products .
The crisis which still less shook the citizens but primarily enterprise at that time just reached her highlight - many companies were forced to adjust her capital subjects and to limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies .
`` Of course we could not escape this situation either . ''
`` The sales declined by 40 per cent , we had to limit the production and even to reach for dismissals '' , declares Karel Ždárský
A viable enterprise must take up also such unpopular measures from time to time .
However , it turned out well to get a grip on the situation and to keep the company in the black numbers even if with smaller profits than before the crisis .
The enterprise was not willing at one in investments in the research and development to make end strokes .
`` From the subsidy we built a research and training centre , we confirmed our presentation at international fairs and purchased first prizes at home exhibitions '' , says Ždárský .
Everything shows it , that we have overcome the crisis .
The sales wax again and with them the number of new employees , too .
I `` wish '' the new winner a lot of joy , has Karel Ždárský lined up at the victory but in more quiet atmosphere .

The Pakistani nuclear programme arouses great anxiety in the USA
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons `` fast than every other country here `` .
Uncoverings of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan .
The contents revealed by the internet portal Wikileaks of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. state department confirm which enormous worries the Pakistani nuclear programme causes Washington .
These reveal , that the cooperation is not strengthened but `` decreases '' on the contrary between the two countries in the area of an atomic safety and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons `` to a faster rhythm than every other country '' on the edge of the clearing and juicy details which offers the documents about the contents of the conversations and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad .
Particularly the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not put together but her components are stored to aggravate her destruction at a possible attack , prepare Washington sleepless nights .
The ambassador lists the following risks in a report in Pakistan , Anne W. Patterson , before the visit of the former head of the national security council , James Jones : `` The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban , the presumable scattering of the nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material '' .
The rocket programmes are , implied the large person number , and this one into the nuclear arsenals is no longer only of the USA but also of Russia when getting out of hand and reason to let caution prevail looked .
`` Pakistan had to take on strictly religious staff for the guarding of the nuclear facilities ; due to the low education and cultural standard extremist organisations have more possibilities of recruiting persons who collaborates in atom or rocket programmes `` , the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a meeting with his North American counterparts .
At the documentation revealed by Julian Assanges internet portal new is that the cooperation between the USA and Pakistan distribution more nuclearly falls off and this increased speed in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons in the area of .
In May this gets the embassy of an office , as being frustrated `` '' the communication with Pakistan describes professedly : `` There frequently is no transparency ; on offers for help we do not receive any answers or they are declined . ''
In another communication Peter Lavoy , official of the state secret service for South Asia , confirms that `` produced as fast as no other country despite the economic catastrophe Pakistan nuclear weapons ''
The ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit of the topmost army head `` to make '' general Ashfaq Kayani , the responsible party , clear that `` Pakistan 's army has to adjust his silent over-support of terrorist groups ''

Sports and rule detour
Tricks like the one of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to avoid a sanction .
The champions League was the reason that a lot of ink about this was spilled the putative of two players the Real Madrid ( Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos ) instigated exclusion in the game of November 23rd against the Ajax in , you should the UEFA sanction whether it was around an unathletic action or not and whether perhaps two players of .
As is generally known , the two players lost ( her team had already won obviously ) time a couple of minutes before playing and several fouls played , so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card .
Real Madrid would lead his group this way and there , become the two players the specified sanction at the next league game against the fulfil Auxerre and get in without cards so into the next game phase .
Finally punished the disciplinary commission the UEFA players involved the coach of the club , José Mourinho , with two games and these with different amounts of money .
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice , she has to be found rather frequently in the world of the football .
She is so far common that she is part of the ethos - the rules which are unwritten but followed in this kind of sport .
Part of the arisen debate around the represented case goes back that a team the football clubs Real Madrid ( which in his hymn magnanimity and honour provides and on other occasions his players for similar occurrences had punished ) played the leading role in and on the dramatization by Mourinho added an episode more to which for his long story as a theatrical and provocative technician has .
In any case the debate turns , whether this behaviour not forbidden by the statutes particularly contradicts the principles of the sports , this is said , whether these actions represent a rule detour . However , this procedure actually observes the statutes of the sports seems to avoid the meaning .
At this matter this one should sporting spirit caused damage examined be this .
The sporting spirit defends the physical intactness of the opponents , an aspect which was not endangered by these actions , because it was not an aggressive game .
Another aspect of a clean game consists in avoiding that the offenders players an unjustified use move from the counter-team . This did not happen either .
It is Real Madrid the paradoxes of the action of the players that she does not correspond to what we usually understand by wrong game or rule detour , because the avoidance of the rule was not performed secretly to avoid a sanction but she should be as striking as possible , so that she is punished by the arbitrator .
The players waited and accepted for the sanction joyfully .
Another question is , which kind of advantage the offenders pulled out of the deliberate fouls .
Here the rival should be stressed that a more unfavourable position neither you took to nor advantages were commanded for the played game , because it was the obvious result of this action that the team of one 's own had to play on with less players .
It is not a useful strategy for the next game either because the club then does not have these players at its disposal .
Obviously the advantage consists that the players start with the next game phase of the champions League without cards which could threaten her participation in a future game .
But it is a long-term one up to a certain degree uncertain advantage , since , sometime , the team also could leave . In addition , the players get a sanction with this procedure and change into the second card cycle in which they leave because of card accumulation with a card fewer than in the first cycle .
It is not so clear with that whether it is really an advantage .
Go such procedures not against the sporting spirit at long last of which also strategic decisions are part to profit from the regulations greatest possible .
In this case the players did not want to avoid a sanction ( this actually would be a clear case of rule detour ) , they rather wanted to vote when they undergo this .
You took a strategic decision without evading a punishment or escaping in front of her .
Although the boundary between inventiveness and rule surroundings is blurred , I think that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness .
I have the impression that the polemics have arisen because of two factors : Because it was all about two self exclusions and because of the way of the provoked rule assignment .
The damage which was damaged to the principles of the sports by these actions is less more ethical than a rather aesthetic way .

Amazon closes servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks gets increasingly into distress .
The Internet service providers ' Amazon has banished the uncovering platform of his servers .
Possibly there is a political pressure behind this after the publication of hundreds of thousands secret diplomat telegrams .
Wikileaks founder Assange stays allegedly in England .
The uncovering platform Wikileaks comes always more strongly under fire in the United States .
The Internet activists lost the access to her previous American server and look for an Internet native country in Europe now .
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called upon other countries and enterprises for the boycott of Wikileaks meanwhile .
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange who stands on the wanted lists of interpol shall stay after a newspaper report in Great Britain .
`` Wikileaks replaced by Amazon server . ''
`` Extemporary talk in the country of the opens '' , the uncovering activists by short message service informed twitter on Wednesday ( local time ) .
The Internet enterprise Amazon had banished the Wikileaks documents of his servers briefly before .
The Internet activists had gone back to the Amazon web service ( AWS ) at the publication of the secret diplomatic telegrams to be able to handle the high access numbers on the documents .
Twitter by Wikileaks declared it step further : `` Fantastic - our dollars are spent now to employ people in Europe . ''
Such has problem with the freedom of speech , `` they should stop selling books '' if Amazon .
Amazon had stopped the use of his servers by Wikileaks after employees of senator Joe Lieberman would have made investigations , the TV station reported to CNN under reference to the office prefer man .
The chairman of the senate committee for homeland security had threatened Amazon with a boycott , the British reported `` to Guardian '' .
I would have Amazon uses to take up this measure in the face of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks the senator said wanted `` , that `` .
Lieberman called in the meantime , countries to refuse the platform the use also into others to servers .
It is said in a communication of the independent senator `` Wikileaks illegal , monstrous and ruthless procedure puts at stake our national safety and endangers around the globe lives '' .
`` Whether American or foreign a responsible enterprise should at no-one Wikileaks his efforts help to spread stolen material . ''
Wikileaks founder Assange who is looked for by the authorities because of rape suspicion in Sweden stands on the wanted list of interpol .
According to a report of the London newspaper `` The Independent '' the 39-year-old Australian stays in Great Britain , the exact place is known to Scotland Yard .
The Internet activist has always described the inquiries as an intrigue of his opponents in Sweden .
Wikileaks speaker Kristin Hrafnsson said in London there had been threats .
`` There were even reputations after a murder of Julian Assange . ''
Therefore Assange is afraid Hrafnsson said around his safety .
The Wikileaks founder will therefore further keep himself hidden .
Obviously Hrafnsson reacted to statements from North America .
The former republican governor had demanded in America that the person responsible for the Wikileaks uncoverings shall be accused and executed because of betrayal of Arkansas , Mike Huckabee .
An adviser of head of the government said to Stephen Harper - obviously Assange should ironically `` be killed '' on television and Obama could `` use a drone '' in Canada .
An exchange of blows broke out in the meantime between the White House and Assange .
The spokesman of the American president Barack Obama , Robert Gibbs , called it her `` ridiculous and absurd '' , that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton , acquaintance become for recently case is responsible for spying requests to diplomats .
`` I am not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a web page '' , so Gibbs .
`` Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more meaningful than his one web page . ''
The American government puts the protection of her databases comprehensively on the test bed now .
The White House informed the vice-director of the centre for anti terror measures , Russell inhabitant of Trave , has been appointed as a special representative .
Inhabitant of Trave is responsible develop `` necessary structural reforms '' which has become necessary after the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks .
The White House also wants to have the ways checked as the entire government exchanges and protects information .
Moreover , the American government announced they the certainty of dissenters and active provide to want , should get into danger by the Wikileaks publication .
We have done everything `` , to enter into contact with them `` , outer office speaker Philip Crowley said .
`` We stand to protect ready , her , if this should become necessary . ''

An arsenic resistant microbe could make new life-forms possible on the earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium type which can live among others on arsenic opens up new possibilities on the earth and elsewhere for new life-forms .
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth , it is a sign in her opinion that a life is possible also without the elements considered to be essential till now .
`` This organism has two possibilities . ''
`` He needs either phosphorus or arsenic for growing . ''
This completely makes it to special something `` , although it almost a type is 'strange ' life-form `` , of the Arizona State University and co. author of the report which appears to the magazine Science in the online version on Thursday Paul C.W . Davies declared .
Six main elements were regarded as essential till now , carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and sulphur .
But as these found out scientists the bacterium grows mono brine in the Californian also then still further , if it replaces phosphorus by arsenic .
The co. author of the report told Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University `` one wonders anyway there otherwise what is still possible '' .
The discovery is an important step at the search for extraterrestrial life , so Anbar , since scientists must recognize lives and his forms .
The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth .
Reason for far common speculations announced a press conference in which no details on the discovery were announced that the report of the discovery of extraterrestrial life could act in the Internet the announcement .
This is not the case .
The discovery shows that organisms can put biochemical processes into walk in other planetary systems with the help of other elements `` explained space Sciences research institutes of the open university of Milton Keynes to Charles Cockell , professor at the Planetary and in the United Kingdom and that the 'standard elements ' which is absolutely essential in our opinion are not firmly predefined absolutely `` .
Base was not part of the research team .
`` A novelty is this work because she shows that an element can be replaced by a different one in basic biochemical processes and structures '' , Cockell added .
This discovery was not coincidental .
The mono brine chose Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the astro-biological institute NASA which conducted the study due to the large arsenic content .
Arsenic and phosphorus chemically are , there himself she assumed that microbes which is exposed to both can replace an element possibly by the different one .
`` The toxicity of the arsenic is primarily based on the fact that it behaves chemically similarly as phosphorus . ''
`` Through this it is difficult for the organisms to distinguish an element of the other . ''
`` But the difference is so big that arsenic seems different than phosphorus . It reaches our biochemical system where it smears everything virtually `` , Anbar explains .
The researchers exposed the bacterium to GFAJ 1 of an increasing arsenic concentration . It adapted and grew .
Although the microbe grows in phosphorus better , anyway that she can survive also into arsenic , shows either on the earth or on either another planet or moon on which arsenic happens more frequent that of course an arsenic based life-form can happen .
According to the Jamie S. Foster , lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida , the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new . There was no operating example but till now yet .
Arsenic happened more frequent within the early earth years , she says , therefore science has assumed that early life-forms have used it .
This admits reason so Forster , this one `` , that life can have developed also differently than in the early geological era `` , not a member of Wolfe Simons assumed research team .
The research was supported by NASA , the department of energy and the national health authorities .

`` My client could deliver explanations to the facts which he was accused of . ''
`` The leading public prosecutor does not have his lawyer said to Yann Arnoux to deprive him of his liberty taken into account .
Another four persons had been arraigned and dismissed from the custody in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday under this two of them under a legal supervision , so the acting public prosecutor Michel Raffin .
Michel Karabadjakian , acting managing director of the refuse disposal company Marseille Provence metropolis ( MPM ) , is followed legally due to `` forbidden influencing control and passive bribery '' .
Two civil servants of the conurbation Aubagne , Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier also were , arrested the one due to the title `` evasion and embezzlement of common property by a representative of the public service '' , the different one because of `` complicity in embezzlement of public funds '' .
The companion through life of Alexandre Guérini , Jeannie Peretti , was also accused of the `` receiving stolen goods and embezzlement of society fortunes '' .
Stéphane Brunengo-Girard belongs to the persons who were compared to Guérini , recently takes wheelings and dealings from public hand which Corsica had concerned into custody due to a similar Affaire more deceitfully .
The investigators suspect his society , contributed to have to wash being money from `` high '' criminal circles .
The examination against X because of a presumed deceit at the placing of public orders is , here particularly in the disposal branch , led in the acts of several open preliminary proceedings because of anonymous letters in April 2009 .

Love in times of the war
Since Angelina Jolie has started with the work on her still nameless debut as a director in summer , there is trouble .
The film script has written her herself , a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man .
One much more does not know about this , this suffices already for unrest , however .
The rumour obstinately persists , the woman , a muslim , falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war .
Bosnian women 's associations have immediately protested whereupon some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo were transferred to Hungary at short notice .
The film is changed course in Hungary and in the post production meanwhile but it is still protested about in Bosnia .
A Bosnian newspaper has reported now Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of female war victims wrote UNHCR to Jolie about the UN refugee relief organization and required a meeting with the actress , Jolie is itself an ambassador of the UN refugee relief organization .
She diplomatically is not , she has offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago before which these , however , declined .
The meeting must take place , so Hasecic , in Bosnia .
Has love stories into rape camps not given it and betrays Jolie 's attitude to her opposite the victims over the film script enough .
Your organisation has recommended according to the UN refugee relief organization dismissing Jolie as an ambassador reports to Guardian .
What exactly has written for Jolie for scenes , however ?
A trick approval has assigned the Bosnian Ministry of Education and the Arts which got to read her film script back and forth for Sarajevo after some , it is not quite clear why Jolie did not nevertheless come then .
The young author herself declares she does not pursue any political intentions with her film , has got used to the Yugoslavia conflict with much effort , wants to show the terrible results of the war and give a voice to all sides involved .
She stays with the contents vaguely , though .
So a second Synopsis for the film in the net which then sounds rather different anyway still circulates : The loving had met in this already in front of outbreak of war and meet again when she , a Bosnian muslim , is protracted into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard duty .
What substantially different does sound of course `` rape victim falls itself for torturer '' as the variant ?
That Jolie 's film actually starts already before the war , so much is sure .
The pressure on her , is `` unfair and been based on misinformations '' , so Jolie .
The hackers of Hollywood can well only provide her with peace now : The film script by she , put into the net before , illegally as already so many .

The FIFA appoints the end judge country World Cup 2018-2022 :
In sheer excitement due to suspicion of corruption the executive committee of the FIFA appoints the end judge countries of the World Cups 2018 and 2022 , a most political election , this one the scrap around influence as well as the lobbying threaten to press the technical criteria to the background on Thursday .
A thing is , however , safe : The distribution in 2018 of the royal discipline of the FIFA will the 4 candidates take place ( in Europe , her traditional stronghold : England , Russia , Spanien-Portugal , Niederlande-Belgium ) .
The distribution in 2022 then will turn out a little more exotic ; the international football association hopes to be able to win for himself on the African continent in 2010 new territories ( Qatar , Australia ) or further to pursue his branch office in the United States or in the Far East ( Japan , South Korea ) after the premiere .
The list of the personalities , this one to the delegation accompanying ( David Cameron , Prince William , José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , José Socrates , this provides Maß Bill Clinton the emir of Qatar , the Belgian and Dutch head of the government , Zidane , Beckham , Cruyff ) economic and political use of a World Cup .
So the wheelings and dealings behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute .
Difficult otherwise , build a hierarchy of the candidates .
According to the evaluation report of the FIFA the English , Spanish Portuguese and American offer file better argument than that one of her competitors .
But these considerations will not be so heavy for the election for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour .
The Sunday Times which stood with the here leadership of the suspension two members of the executive committee ( Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu ) at the beginning of the uncoverings could have spoiled the chances just as well for her own country , cradle of the football , the World Cup was allowed to deliver this namely 1966 only once .
The three influential had BBC given this breeding ground on Monday once more by having radiated a documentary report members of the committee , namely Ricardo Teixeira , Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire takes .
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to embarrass the English responsible parties which had primarily operated an intensive lobbying with David Cameron within these last weeks .
The head of the government hopes for a reprint of the gambit Tony Blair was succeeded of his predecessor which had obtained the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012 for London in 2005 .
Would this intensive use suffice to increase the value of the image of England in front of the committee again ?
Nothing is less for certain , then this duo Spanien-Portugal does not lack trumps with his already ready stadia , his expertise ( WC 82 in Spain , Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona , EM 2004 in Portugal ) and his football culture .
But the economic and financial shady sides of the two countries could muffle her ambitions .
The possible reprisals against the Englishmen as well as the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal let the chances of Russia which has become the heavy outsider despite his gaps in the dossier ( stadia , hotels , transport ) rise .
Prime minister Vladimir Putin has the frank hint on the accusations decided , however , the English Presse denounced `` an unfair competition in the preparations for the coordination '' on the part of the committeemen .
`` One throws dirt at her '' , one tries to compromise her , Putin cursed .
For 2022 the United States seem to be the logical favourites , strengthened by the experience of 1994 .
A long list seems to show a first economic world power , seat of the FIFA main sponsors , the country of advantages over Japan and South Korea which have separately built a very beautiful project .
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries which had helped organize the competitions in 2002 .
Another threat : The permission of the WCs in 2026 for China which let the Asian chances of 2022 get invalid longed for by the FIFA much .
With Australia and Qatar which pulled all the stops with the waiting at table of futuristic stadia had , does the FIFA pursue her extension in the direction of the new areas , these two countries , however , represent a greater risk , because certainty .
Australia could have to suffer weakness of the television rights just like Japan and South Korea under this one of the European countries akquittierten ( due to the time lag ) , the sensitive nerve of the FIFA .

Rate of unemployment remained stable in France in the third quarter
The rate of unemployment in France is in the metropolis according to the international employment office ( IAA ) on stable 9.3 % ( under inclusion of the overseas departments on 9.7 % ) , the temporary , seasonally adjusted details which were published by the statistical Federal Office Insee on Thursday point so .
The unemployment rate in the metropolis establishes herself on 2,631 millions .
The details of the second quarter amounted to 9.3 % of the population fit for work in the metropolis and to 9.7 % under inclusion of the departments overseas .
Over the year the rate of unemployment recorded an increase in 0.1 percentage points .
Not looked more thoroughly 3.4 million employed persons of the French metropolis were employed in the third quarter , wished , however , to find a work ; integrated , whether they were fit for use now every two weeks or not or whether they were person looking for employment or not .

In the third quarter 637,000 of the teenagers were between 15 and 24 years after givings of the IAA unemployed .
The senior citizens have for their part a slight increase in the working drawing lots quota of 6.4 % in the metropolis ( +0,2 percentage point over three months as well as over the year seen ) to record , i.e . 482 000 of the over 50-year-old persons 6.6 % under inclusion of the departments overseas .

Grammy nominations : Surprisingly , the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was honoured in the category newcomer of the year
People will notice it if you on inquiry from a president appearance .
President Obama asked Esperanza Spalding to appear at the ceremony on the occasion of the noble presentation of prizes 2009 . Now became the 26-year jazz bass player and singer surprisingly nominates Grammy for this year 's in the category newcomer of the year .
In view of the fact that Spalding is already one celebrated star in the jazz scene in 2008 since her album `` Esperanza '' the nomination seems a little unusual . But she corresponds to the Grammy rules according to which an artist may have returned not more than three albums before publication of the album with which he was confessed in the broad public .
Your ambitious album from the year 2010 , `` Chamber Music Society '' , is surely a step forwards . And with her elated voice and a good feeling for pop , radio and Latin Music one can compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003 safely whose great success comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination of Spalding most nearly in the year 2003 .
Furthermore the album `` Historicity '' of the Vijay Iyer trio was nominated in the category 's instrumental albs . This darling of the critics experienced a smash hit through this .
`` Moody 4 B '' of the experienced saxophone player James Moody and `` Positootly '' of the keyboarder John Beasley and others are part of the competitors Iyers .
Trombone shortie , a rough-and-ready favourite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs `` Treme '' , was honoured in the category contemporary jazz in which albums of Stanley Clarke , John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber otherwise can rather be found .
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue got large group of well rightful attention in the category . He therefore competes with the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and the Dave Holland fond of adventure and his octet whose Life album `` Pathways '' is a good example of a bass player as a democratic band leader .

Nothing like away here
In this evening it runs correctly around for the Irishmen finally again .
No trace of grief .
For this the home team dominates his guests from Sweden , Finland and the USA too much .
The fans howl at with joy music , she more loudly stamp crashing with the feet .
The Bailey pub in the south Irish Cork shakes because the players table tennis balls throw , and meet three metre distance about one into beer cups .
`` Bierpong '' calls itself , the bizarre show to win there is 500 euros winning bonus for the Bierpong World Cups plus plane tickets to Las Vegas in January .
Cian Tanner is a quiet type ; this does not really go together this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist .
And the 26-year-old tries himself anyway what will get the future amuse , turn himself away of the piercing question .
On his plan game fun is not in Las Vegas , he will lead job interviews in New Zealand in January .
`` I have a rotten feeling '' , he says .
`` It is so far away from home and I do not have work yet there . ''
After all : His friend already waits for him in Auckland - `` she had in no time her wish job as an event manager , perhaps one good sign '' , the young man says and smiles .
Having at home already two of Tanner 's three brothers and sisters sought her luck because of bad prospects abroad .
His sister Yvonne , a social worker , is in Sydney , his brother Colin has a place as an IT adviser in London now .
The boys go : As in the case of the Tanners it looks in many families on the island .
experts of the economy and social research institute predict 100.000 Irishmen will well leave the country in the near future for ESRI in Dublin .
They even count on 200.000 emigrants to 2015 .
For the little country with only 4.5 million inhabitants an intense loss .
If the forecasts prove well-founded , it comes to an emigration wave comparably with that one which Ireland suffered from in the eighties .
After a decade of the upswing which brought about a great prosperity for the Irishmen sadness spreads out now once more .
The economic crisis makes primarily the Irishmen uncertain who are young and trained well for whom it only uphill was till now .
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd within the boom years .
Everybody was used , there was money in the abundance .
There are three of ten women and men under thirty without work meanwhile , however .
There are in throngs letters to the editor of young emigrants who complain in Irish Times : `` Everything goes the brook down in Ireland . ''
`` There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - , however , who can , does a whole generation go away and our country lose . ''
`` The last one then turns off the light , please . ''
Law female student Leanne Caulfield , president of the Irish student union , sees a gloomy future pulling up because the government does only sham and offers young people no more future prospects .
`` You reduce the minimum wages but they do not have any strategy as new jobs shall be created '' , says the 20-year-old .
She observes how her fellow students move themselves hand over hand from an unpaid traineeship to close to it .
She says , it is your greatest worry to have to emigrate within four years .
`` This thought is sad and depressing . ''
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively .
The `` WorkingAbroadExpo '' organizes McLarnon , offers work a fair , these comprehensive services to the topic abroad .
`` The work is an excellent chance , the first steps to make career ladders to it open , for beginners abroad anyway '' , says the manager .
Photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders on his web page in Canada .
The message is clear : Is not a galley service but takes liberty and fun also abroad work .
Seán O'Donovan has known to build something up somewhere else for half a year as it feels .
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland , he is working with 15 Irish colleagues on the making in Germany now .
They just pull up a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen .
It goes on to Hanover or Berlin to the next project in January .
Meanwhile , his native country only seldom sees O'Donovan because he makes extra shifts to be able to pay the loan for his house off at home .
`` The situation is already a bit crazy '' , he says when he kicks out over the threshold of his house at long time for the first time .
`` I earn money for a house in Germany in Ireland in which I am as good as never again . ''
He laughs a little in embarrassment and goes by from chilled rooms .
The little house is with neat front gardens , in a fine residential area into which entries park big , expensive cars .
In common with a sister O'Donovan has the house in common four years ago for 380.000 euro bought - 100 per cent credit-financed ago .
`` These were crazy times , there was simple money without many questions `` , he says .
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the loan ?
O'Donovan wonders a while pours out hot tea and says : `` I do not have any children , I feed which must and I am young ; even if everything goes wrong , I can begin once more . ''
The civil engineer does not like lamenting , at present , he often hears this .
Nobody can be hungry `` - is not anyway by far as dramatically as in earlier times our situation here on the island `` , he says .
`` Works a while abroad , this is not the worst which can happen , perhaps we feel through this only as Irishmen . ''
He then laughs and tells stories of his father who has gone in the last great economic crisis to England .
`` After seven years he was there again and the life went in Ireland further , very simply . ''
Cian Tanner likes this thought .
Leaves the future open and simply looks , how it runs with the life somewhere else .
One couple of years work in London does he already have behind himself , too and why should it not run also well in New Zealand for him and his friend ?
A thing which terribly worries him within these days still is there , however : The celebration for his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin .
He is afraid that it could degenerate into a farewell party .

White Russia agrees not further to accumulate uranium capable of bearing arms
In a surprising victory for president Obama 's campaign to the worldwide safeguarding of nuclear material the government of White Russia has announced on Wednesday that one will collect highly enriched uranium no more which is a critical component of nuclear weapons .
The deal was announced to the Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton in an additional article of the safety summit in a common statement after a meeting with the Belorussian Foreign Secretary Sergei Martynov .
For years , the U.S. government had tried to convince White Russia to collect no longer highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring .
The U.S. government told the Washington post that two secret agreements with White Russia were reached within the last two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium capable of bearing arms from a Belorussian research institute official .
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material , approximately 500 pounds , this one anonymously has left according to an official employee due to the sensibility of the topic .
The agreement seems one of Obamas most important results `` to nuclear safety summit of the 47 nations '' to be of April which had excluded White Russia .
And obviously it was good enough to safeguard the invitation of the former Soviet republic for the next summit in 2012 .
`` I was really enthusiastic about the fact that want her a seat in the nuclear safety summit of 2012 ) ( . ''
`` This proves me that it works '' , told a group to Ken Luongo , president of the partnership of global safety , for the promotion of the nuclear safety .
Clinton mentioned the agreement `` a very important , important step '' of White Russia .
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to safeguard all precarious nuclear material within four years .
The U.S. government has helped six countries since then her highly enriched uranium to get loose .
White Russia will be the seventh .
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush .
The Belorussian president has explained to Alexander Lukashenko in the time of Obama nuclear safety summit that the nation will never give up her uranium .
`` How hundreds keep highly enriched uranium - of kilo which basically is capable of bearing arms , Lukashenko said and less enriched uranium `` , at that time .
`` This is our raw material ...
We will not make any dirty bombs from this and we will sell it to nobody . ''
White Russia approached nevertheless the USA few months ago when it reported interest in the meeting of an agreement .
Attempt was particularly complicatedly the first say official to remove the uranium of White Russia in October because the material was contaminated by radiation easily .
It got special train loaded , the more than 1.300 miles to one Russian factory for storage say official into one and disposal for .
The second attempt was decided on on Monday and was carried out according to the official ones by aeroplane .
The U.S. government pays $ 14 million for these efforts , in which a large part of the money flows in the Belorussian research with weakly enriched uranium which can not be used for nuclear weapons .
`` This which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton was coordinated and coordinated extremely carefully to build up confidence '' , said Andrew Bieniawski , a representative of the department of energy which works on the global danger reduction .
James Martin Zentrum estimates this , that White Russia had at least 88 pounds of uranium capable of bearing arms this year as well as hundreds of uranium enriched pound highly for Nichtweiterzugebende studies .
White Russia wants to dissolve his store according to the joint agreement to 2012 .
Harsh disdain of the human rights was hard , primarily the relations between White Russia and the USA because of Lukashenkos for years .
But the statement of the Wednesday suggests a possible approach .
An increased respect for the democracy and the human rights remains a central topic in the improvement in the bilateral relations in White Russia and it is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens `` welcoming the progress of these global safety questions announce the United States of America and White Russia , that `` , she declares .

Government bond for the take-over of eXcentris
The Quebecers government which in parallel was asked by the Société Angus as well as the enterprise to participate financially in the take-over of the cinema complex eXcentris explains to himself with an a cooperation 's agreeably , however only in form of one competitive loan .
Parallel , these did not have for enterprises his real cinematic function to over-answers , receivedly obvious what they have required the developer company Angus as well as this , around this again , hoped for a donation in the amount of seven million dollars of the Ministry of Education and the Arts for the take-over of the Daniel Langlois of belonging cinema complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint Laurent .
Although the government has himself accepted , to involve in this thing , though on her own terms .
Instead of the expected donation a loan in lower height hoped initially as this one which could bring a viable solution on advantageous terms into being at least in opinion rather offers the Quebecers government this one from sources taking destitute of the state gossip factory .
A first action plan as well as an inquiry after 12.8 million have been rejected by the Quebec already last spring , this petition was made go down sum moderately once more since this .
This one already became `` a suggestion together with an action plan Société de développement of the entreprises cultural `` ( SODEC ) sent to minister St-Pierre of the president who conducts the file eXcentris , François Macerola .
He had sent her a last factual report several days ago .
The counterproposal of the cabinet was transmitted , however , to the SODEC on Wednesday .
Parallel and Angus have now until December 31st time to respond to it .
Anyway the premise of the state donation seems to have been pressed really aside .
We call each other , that the Quebecers owner community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment to the support of the take-over of eXcentris , she put forward the argument , this one the Minister of Education and the Arts does not have to help financially for property projects there by he has not also other cinema halls sent .
Several other participants in the market of the segment sued , however , for a material , economic aid unlike this .
Cinema boss Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema under great difficulties in the premises of his cinema complex after the own financed construction of the cinema more than ten years for a long time which the special position could justify on the part of the treasury .
The lack of cinema halls which show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal and eXcentris knew how to hold his clients at the bar .
The Société Angus as well as the enterprise steer for their part for a campaign financed privately of which they hope for a sum $ to boost the acquisition parallel with Christian Yaccarini at the lead .
Since the spring 2009 only one single canvas has continued namely Le to show films in eXcentris parallel .
It is aim of the future buyers to open the three cinema halls of year next to February 27th with the demonstration of the very excellent film of Xavier Beauvoir of `` the bar et of the dieux '' newly .
However , Christian Yaccarini has not recalled the newspaper `` Le Devoir '' and one ignores what he and his group keep of the suggestions made go down which one has made to them .

Weak applause for China
Taiwan 's electors approach slowly a closer connection to the mainland .
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the strait ?
On November 27th more than 7.5 m. made electors to themselves , these are 70 % of all persons entitled to vote open to vote for mayors and town councils in the five municipal districts . This is judged to be a broad assessment of the president Ma Ying-jeou .
By the construction of pioneering business relations , incl . a partial free trade agreement , Ma is itself a symbol figure for the relations to the mainland . His policy has changed the relations to the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949 lastingly .
Ma has passed the examination , however only scarce .
Although his Kuomintang party ( KMT ) puts mayors for three of five , she did not get any majority of votes .
The democratic progressive party ( DPP ) , the one greater independence of Taiwan approved , almost 50 % of the votes , which got KMT got 45 % instead .
At a presidential election this would have meant problems for Ma .
Since his election two years ago the percentage of votes of his party has fallen by approx . 8 % .
For the first time the DPP moved in to the town councils even together with KMT .
During the choice it came usual occurrences like lorry convoys with rowdies , mass moves and flags swinging over only scantily dressed dancers , to this one in Taiwan .
There was even the obligatory , mysterious murder attempt .
Sean Lien , the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman held KMT a speech on a KMT candidate on the evening before of the election ,
when a man shot in his face from the crowd . Lien was wounded and an overleaf spectator killed .
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the marksman wanted to kill Lien or settle a quarrel with the candidate .
The attack has independently of it impaired the election according to the Tsai Ing-wen , the leader the DPP , and moved the DPP in a bad light which has granted KMT more votes .
China was possibly the tallest winner of the campaign .
The relations to the mainland remarkably did not become picks out as a central theme .
The candidates over plans to council flats and the job creation debated instead .
The Taiwaneses love her actual independence and decline China 's armed forces threat .
For this reason KMT does not like to put her relations to the government in Beijing to the foreground .
But the DPP avoided this time , too , stirring the anti Chinese feelings up too much .
She reacted thus anew consciousness , that Taiwan 's economy can not survive without China .
Ma would for his part like to be able to to confirm that the majority of the Taiwaneses approves his China policy .
Furthermore the government in Beijing will pursue his strategy , to lure back Taiwan with economic incentives to the community .
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit meeting for investment safety and medical cooperation .
It surely also wishes a political integration . First but the important one .
It thus prefers to wait to after the presidential elections in 2012 .
The DPP has invented himself newly by now .
She was weakened strongly two years ago : The former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison because of corruption .
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he stood up vehemently for the absolute independence .
But a new generation of moderate politicians developed under Tai 's reign and the DPP fights for the voices of the working persons and the youth .
Tsai met with a great approval , like Su Tseng-chang under Chen , as a candidate for the presidency the DPP .
Your party does everything now to show that also she is able to build up close relations to Beijing .
Tsai plans a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China . This presupposes however unprejudiced discussions .
Tsai explained publicly that her party offers a `` trustworthy alternative '' to Mas of rash approach towards China .
Chen seems very annoyed about this change .
He explained from his cell the candidates would have done to this to the DPP better to insist on Taiwan 's independence .
He even asked the pragmatist Su to do without the presidency candidature .
Also without Chen 's interference the DPP has difficulties hardly to vote for her possible candidate .
KMT will have to undergo a self-analysis of her own .
Ma 's values are bad despite the rapid economic growth ; the KMT candidates wanted to conduct her election campaign without him .
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the still further scissors between the poor and the rich .
According to the statement of a KMT speaker he will alter his cabinet as well as the local facilities .
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan approves a rapprochement only restrictedly .
Most Taiwaneses consider the economic cooperation with China unavoidable at the same time .
It already gives none back sound Antonio Chiang a prominent columnist `` more `` .

Secret to the middle
Within the weeks after the sudden death of your husband Argentina 's president , Cristina Fernández , learned a wave from liking which drove her popularity instalment around 20 points on over 50 % up . This is the highest value since her election in the year 2007 .
Whether this helps her to get a re-election , however , next year depends on it , Cristina Fernández is willing to compromise than her deceased husband , her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner whether this one obviously mourning .
The signs for it are not clear .
Néstor Kirchner who steered the economic policy also after the election of his wife frequently built budgets which fully did not take into account the inland revenue receipts , the economic growth and the inflation .
This permitted the president couple to spend the extra takings after a discretion of his own .
The Fernández government lost the majority on the paper in the convention last year .
But the opposition is and sexton split death after a heart attack on October 27th led to further disagreements .
Some critics of the regime from the rows of the ruling peronists went and stood behind Cristina Fernández .
But the convention did not manage after chaotic meetings ( during which a parliamentarian beat another into the face and others accused the government of the bribery ) to say goodbye to the household for 2011 .
`` I will not discuss it '' , so the president .
The household 2010 is necessary to spend money after a discretion of its own now for the next year through which the president has still more opportunity , too .
The economy runs hot : She probably will grow this year by up to 9 % .
The official rate of inflation is 11.1 % at present , but numerous private valuations and wage claims of the trade unions drive the value on almost 30 % .
Kirchner who assumed the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises explained the inflation reduction to growth and poverty alleviation to his primary objectives and not .
He refused the cooperation with the IMF , the national institute for statistics and national census INDEC which embellished the official inflation statistics after that harassed the private sector and cleaned .
Can Fernández take a more moderate way now ?
She has called upon the private industry and the trade union leaders for conversations .
And according to official statements increases in pay shall be limited next year on 18 % .
Argentina 's agricultural products have the high world market prices given the economy a strong impetus .
But the inflation undermined the growth push by a great devaluation in the year 2002 .
Cristina Fernández would possibly like to attach Argentina to the rest of the world for this reason financial world economically again .
The government reached an agreement with bond-holders at the beginning of this year which had declined the earlier funding of the country in the year 2001 .
These seem now to press Fernández on an agreement with the sponsors from the Paris club , her approx . $ 6.7 bn owes .
The sexton had always declined a check by the IMF as elsewhere usual .
But the Minister of Trade and Commerce Amado Boudou announced last month that the fund will do a national cost-of-living consumer price index `` technical support '' at the construction of a new . It looks as if this were the first step towards the cleaning of the INDEC .
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active also without the support by her husband after completion of her period of office .
She needs the support of the middle shift which has for the most part of the Kirchnerism enough if yes , to this .
If the Argentines return from her summer holiday in March , the wave of the sympathy which was shown for her will have faded away .
If she liked to win another election , she must make up her mind , whether she cancels many political decisions of her husband quietly and quietly .

The chairman judge , Jon C. Blue of the colonel Supreme Court , rejected the applications by decision laconically last week when he said that the new media would be `` carefully checked '' , and that there would be no proof of it , that the jury has been driven of passions .
But this was not the last word in this thing certainly yet .
For decades court objections have noticed that the reporting lets doubt about the fairness of a process arise about famous notorious cases .
In his historical decision of 1966 the supreme court of justice of the United States has the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard , an osteopath from Cleveland who shall have killed his wife , lifted , and said in his decision that there would have been a `` carnival atmosphere in the courtroom '' because of the new media .
Some think that the television series and the feature film is based on this crime `` on the flight '' .
Some lawyers say court objections , which Mr. look at Hayes Verurteilung half a century later , could around the communication channels from the courtroom follow the argument that new rules have become necessary , these in the time of the case Dr. Sheppard were still inconceivable to regulate .
`` There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the new media in processes which are pursued by a broad public '' , said John J. Donohue III , professor at the Stanford Law School who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut . According to his report she is imposed arbitrarily .
Professor Donohue said some appellation courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication out of the courtroom could make trials fairer .
Only one is the twittering matter of many which explain the lawyers of Mr. to Hayes to discuss for years and one therefore delay Verurteilung .
The defenders also claim for example that Mr. Hayes could already have been in front of sentenced when judge had not permitted them Blue to test the reactions of potential jurors , by one showing them horrible scene of the crime photos during the juror choice .
Some of the jurors have said , photos of the victims , Jennifer Hawke-Petit , 48 years , and her daughter , Hayley , 17 years and Michaela would have fulfilled her with disgust for 11 years .
The defenders say they also would question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution and argue that the judge has exchanged a juror wrongly which has been a critic of the public prosecutor 's office and that he would more inadmissibly have performed way pressure on the verdict when he had taken the not usual decision to put the jury freely over the weekend .
The jurors were not isolated .
But perhaps the greatest interest draws her arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting about the process on itself .
Has this one submitted her in a verdict contestation last month , stated her that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and lasting the election campaign was discussed by the candidates for the office of the governor and for the American senate .
You argued that the new media would have kindled the flames of the emotions about the case continuously newly .
`` The lawyers wrote , `` , `` such a daily crowd the medium bleepers cameras and reporter outside the courtroom one has not experienced even nationwidely in New Haven and perhaps before yet yet . ''
Your main emphasis on the reporting through twitter is controversial .
In interviews some journalists said that the assertion this direct news is more seditious than reports which is reported more slowly , a technophobic look , is this one the reporting becomes impoverished about future processes .
But some lawyers said appellation courts would be often confronted with the argument , social and technical changes bedürften of the adaptation by the courts .
Mr. Hayers lawyers make this assertion grow .
In her objection they referred , in which to the decision of the colonel court of justice of 1966 the Verurteilung of Dr. Sheppard was lifted due to the reporting and made clear , that the new media require new rules .
`` They wrote , `` , `` so this case Sheppard performs official duties toward Maxwell of the 21st century . ''

The geriatric care centre confirms that the deaths can not be explained by `` missing measures ''
The owners of the old people 's home in Olot do not rule out that her male nurse killed more than eleven older people
The responsible parties of the geriatric care centre of La Carita in Olot ( Gerona ) gave a press conference yesterday in which pointed her out Joan Vila Dilmés - the male nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had the criminal actions caused the facilities , which damage .
The head of the geriatric care centre , Joan Sala , got on in front of court the process and the civil law liability and announced `` responsible parties would Laly like to accuse this one of Caritas ( for the deaths ) '' , however , `` the right and our liability duty force us `` to take care in the company of his lawyer , Joan Cañada .
The facilities must accept not only a social reputation loss because she had not established the criminal actions of the male nurse on time but pay a large amount of compensation now which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims , too .
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime declines for August 2009 and that , since then , he has further murdered .
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric care centre - since he suspected that no doctor has examined the decedents personally but the formalities were dealt with by phone due to the age and illnesses .
The conductor of La Caritas denied this point flatly and explained , that `` measures failing to appear could have been the reason for the occurrences at that time ''
The lawyer of La Caritas added , that `` would not '' give any circumstantial evidence for negligent actions to another person than the accused in the lawsuit
This one already as christened `` angel of death '' confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and explained , the first crime commits on August 29th , 2009 and the second old lady murders one and a half months later to have .
In this case he killed insulin with an overdose as opposed to the first crime at which he had given a mixture of different depressants .
The leader of La Caritas explained the entry of the staff to the medicine has to be checked only with difficulty .
The male nurse used depressant cocktail at six of nine committed crimes to free the patients with the death of her suffering the insulin syringes and this .
But the results of the laboratory examinations will point out , whether Vila lies and actually chose for his first victims a less cruel death or whether he cauterized these from inside , by giving bleaching lye to them as he had done it according to the confession with three women whom he murdered between October 12th and 17th .
In La Caritas who could absolutely be more one does not believe the statements of the male nurse , the number of confessed murders does even not concern what . This attitude is justified that Vila had made very different statements ahead of court and that it does not make sense to change his procedure suddenly after eight successful murders .
You say they provided themselves with her for this reason and to the enlightenment of the reach of these occurrences of the justice .

U.S. document leaked out portrays Moscow as a port of the corruption
Control of the town is in the hands of the `` kleptocracy '' and she passes a part of the bribes and the protection money which gathers her on to the Kremlin . So the American embassy in Russia reported in a Memo in February .
It is so said both police and the state security service blackmail large protection moneys so that they can keep her expensive standard of living in Moscow .
You do not collect money only of legitimized business but also of organized criminal gangs .
Every shift of the bureaucracy has - as `` vertical the authority `` - what takes his part of the money , the ladder walks up described prime minister Vladimir Putin this .
The Memo which was sent to Washington under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle was published by WikiLeaks on his home page on Tuesday .
The Memo is based on sources whose names were edited .
It was written during Yuri Luzhkov Moscow 's mayor still was and it accuses him of the corruption .
He was fired by president Dmitry Medvedev in October , but there is hardly a proof that you would have tidied in the meantime .
Luzhkov and his wife , Yelena Baturina , whom a known building firm has have rejected corruption reproaches again and again over years and he has won numerous slander actions against such accusations .
He explained to a Russian TV station in September as him after a documentation you asked , this one suggests , he is corrupt : `` It is crazy , it is dirty , it is dirty . ''
An unbelievably large number to believe Russians that her society is corrupt . Surveys have this devotedly .
But it is unusual that single persons are called as happened in the report of the ambassador , and it is unheard that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country .
`` The direct connection of the government of Moscow '' with the crime has the Memo been the reason that some describe her as `` disturbed '' and come to the end as a government that the government rather like one kleptocracy acts , so .
`` Criminal elements enjoy a `` kryshna '' ( a concept from the world of the criminals/the mafia which `` roof '' or protection word-for-word means ) , this one , office of the public prosecutor extends over the police , the security of the state ( FSB ) , the service supervisory authority ( MVD ) and this as well as by the complete Moscow government bureaucracy .
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow .
`` Luzhkov is at a topmost place . ''
`` FSB , MVD and the militia stand on the second step . ''
`` The vulgar criminals and the criminal inspectors follow on the undermost step last . ''
`` This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the town offers no help . ''
The report passes on that the police arrest little business people the FSB money of the largest companies collected and this .
A source is so said , is , `` explained , that Moscow 's shopkeepers understand , the protection that it is the best , get by the MVD and FSB and not of the organized crime ( ) , there she does not only have more weapons , resources and power than the criminals , but also because they are protected by the law . ''
`` For this reason the protection is no longer as in demand as early by criminal gangs . ''
The Memo notices that no the protection be itself very modest while collecting the monies is comprehensive ; sometimes even the ones who pay are arrested .
The ones who does not pay find her business closed very fast in front of - due to the pretext .
Medvedev has repeatedly has at the same time said , however , that he only has made few progress talked about fighting the corruption .
The Memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases which were presumably full of money .
`` Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats in his fight against corruption '' told Georgy Satarov , director of by , a Moscow fact-finding mission , recently in an interview .
`` But he is part of this bureaucracy . ''
`` It is not a part of the political class because a political class does not exist in Russia any more . ''
Without politicians without an opposition without a separation of the forces , he says so , corruption is unavoidable .
Nationwidely estimates so by the corruption costs Russia , more than $ 300 billion per annum .
The country shunts Transparence International on place 154 of a newer examination to the global perception of the corruption by the non-state organisation ( countries are of listed too `` most corruptly `` least indeedly '' '' ) .
The uncovering of the Memos of the American embassy which was carried out late in the evening after Moscow time will arouse displeasure , although certainly within the Russian government , it also can be an opportunity for the Kremlin since Luzhkov can be accused for the faults of Moscow to claim that one solves the problems .
In an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously with the uncovering , that American diplomats have called him Batman and Medvedev Robin .
It `` is the truth that it is about our interaction which is an important factor of the domestic policy in this country '' , he said .
`` But to be honest , we would not have expected this with such a pressure and in such an unethical way to happen with such an arrogance know . ''

Métro grand Paris : First financial outlines
Since the debate is in full swing around the modernization of the traffic economy on the Ile-de France , it rains billions .
At least in the discussions .
One calls himself particularly the 23 billion for the metro grand Paris in memory , the one of the Société you grand Paris shall be built .
To arrange the start of building of the SGP , the state has exclaimed a capital donation of 4 billion euros .
This is the sum in the theoretical scheme which would make it possible for the SGP thereupon to award a part of the finance sum to double to hers on the markets .
Today , it finally has come to first projections .
The addition household of 2010 contains the scheduled measures to find the first part of these monies , had a look by the finance commission of the National Assembly this morning .
This is two lei measures : The creation of a special tax for the opening up and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France .
You one takes article 15 of the law outline , goes the former , `` in favour of the institution under public law , Société , grand Paris `` so .
This is figured : `` The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per annum '' .
A reorganization of the enterprise taxation already existing is second : increase you by the product arising from her to modernize these `` and this rise of the Société grand Paris to over-answers `` .
How much would this bring in ?
A puzzle .
This sum is not estimated in the text .
One is far away the 4 billion .
It is executed that the tax resources are added to the capital donation to the 4 billion euros `` this one be found by the state and the Société little by little is done to grand Paris for the project `` , you have to be gathered from the explanatory exposition so .
One does not find this system offensive at the SGP at all .
`` One can cover more than three years for a long time and then create only from the 4 billion the project planning since the moment at which one credits takings ( the two taxes , d. R. ) '' , is explained so .
`` This is noted down and removed little by little in the budget '' .
The SGP estimates , that it will be started with in 2013 to note down the 4 billion for the budget 2014 .
This measure one still will be able look for the 4 promised billion for a long time , runs the risk of causing a quite busy , parliamentary discussion .
The first public meeting takes place on December 7th .

Tourist places must insist improved be
Tour organizers are sorry for the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad condition the Glorieta Sanchez Taboada in Mazatlán .
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the drop of the Glorieta Sanchez Taboada the tourism industry of Mazatlán applied to the authorities to give special attention to the areas which are in a bad condition and project a bad picture onto the port .
Salvador Barraza Rubio , chairman of the dealer association of Zona Dorado , reminded that it was demanded to different opportunities to cultivate the destination and to convert the bad conditions to new employment opportunities or routes which find the tourists .
He said , the bad condition this one streets and sidewalks would have had a negative effect , since the tourists would come and would see the disorder to the amble , whereupon she would turn this one towards the backs near situated shops .
`` The politicians do not know what it means have to day close an enterprise and they do not make any thoughts on it to themselves as one loses a lot of money one . Because they otherwise would not carry out the construction work slowly and unmethodically this way . ''
The hotel proprietor José Ramón Manguart Sanchez said the fall of the tourist would have drawn one 's attention to the missing prevention and the maintenance works failing to appear on the part of the town .
`` The municipality must take on and avoid her responsibility , which happens to something like that once again . How she shall do this ? Well , by a preventative maintenance everything turns on to repair `` , afterwards he explained .
`` We wait longingly to have a clean town . We also have inhabitants a right to a clean day room because she does not only because it is a tourist area have to be maintained . The municipal authority must change her strategy to get the town in a good condition . ''

The ice university
Ice pastry-cooks are prepared for better seasons at the `` Gelato University '' near Bologna .
The three-day elementary course for future Gelatieri has the biggest draw and visitors from the whole world .
Where does the whole ice come from actually ?
Of the Gelatiere and of the Gelataio .
The Gelatiere , in German something produce the cream ancient the ice pastry-cook , according to all rules of the Italian ice doer art .
The Gelataio fetches one spatulas , the ice cream from the refrigerated display counter she paints into the waffle and she then sells .
To know this one does not have to Anzola dell ' to drive Emilia in the province Bologna .
But who to know more still over ice would like , this one does not pass the `` Gelato-University '' of the Italian company Carpigiani .
The manufacturer of ice-cream machines has set up the ice university in the year 2003 so that the ice cream does justice to the high Italian ideals out of his machines everywhere .
The three-day elementary course for future Gelatieri has the biggest draw and visitors from all the world .
However , there are also several days of special courses around the chocolate ice-cream and traineeships in the ice-cream parlour of his own .
Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career others simply venture on the smooth ice of her vague longings .
There are 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents of Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia this time .
Jacky , art-teacher from California , loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial intercity express train cream in future .
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag something own in a nerve-racking job after years .
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream parlour in Cairo .
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in her bars , and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream .
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream next to the participants .
Only good taste but also the silky suppleness is not decisive and consistency the good .
However , Luciano does not forget the cream topping of the national and at all southern superstructure at his training either : `` Italian Gelato is simply the best , and any amount is then still Romanticism . ''
The first step towards the production seems very simple .
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients milk , cream , powdered milk , sugar and antiroll bars into a great mixer which heats everything up to 85 degrees and then immediately cools down on four degrees with an electronic programme .
He then turns the machine a tap , and a pasteurized white base cream , basis for all milk ice cream types , comes out .
The assistant professor is immediately bombarded with questions : Can one make ice cream only with natural substances without antiroll bar ?
How can one let the experimenting desire 's of one 's own free run ?
Luciano warns to have himself led astray of the Zeitgeist .
Who talks about ice cream `` only from natural ingredients '' has nevertheless used antiroll bars possibly - most natural product , approximately guar gum from the Guarbohne .
Loud little ice pellets of course one can produce ice also without antiroll bar , it then must be sold within a day only , otherwise it sinks into himself together and the customer bites on .
Certain variations at the matrix are permitted .
It gets more thrilling with the flavours .
For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket .
Moreover , gives there are powder and pasta .
`` All the suppliers will try to palm dozens of aromatized additions off on you . ''
`` But simply you should experiment . ''
At the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits either .
Or just at the ice cream from the white matrix which becomes the yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder to the basis for all possible chocolate seductions .
The students may to the ice-cream machines now .
She lets Luciano produce four different types each of vanilla , chocolate , mocha and hazelnut ice-cream with or without eggs in the matrix with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additions .
The fruit sundae types are also subjected to the same experiment .
More flavors , more fruit purée , as regards taste this is not better absolutely .
Hazelnut ice-cream does not taste nuttier absolutely if it contains more hazelnuts .
The most popular kiwi ice restores the working group to health who uses more fruits , less water and a little less antiroll bar .
A balanced mixture stresses the taste of a Gelato correctly first , says Luciano .
Ice making is a sum : If peach purée is used with much sugar , the sugar amount must be reduced in the basic recipe .
For lemon ice-cream an extra portion of sugar is necessary .
Luciano draws a device out , with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit types ( winegrowers measure the degrees Oechsle in the grape juice with that ) .
Tables the calculation fortunately make easier .
It requires physical use to make ice no longer as much as in the past .
Not only the device for the automatic production of the matrix helps .
There also is a device in which the ready ice mixture is beaten creamily and cooled on minus temperatures at the same time .
Small breakdowns do not fail to appear Aller automation to this despite .
The Brazilian Gustavo spills from above to below fruit purée over themselves and his course colleagues when the colossal staff blender turns out for him out of control .
`` Maestro Luciano thinks , in every course `` , `` it is only a question of time until something like that happens . ''

Cambodian rouge veterans with the past forced to the confrontation
The director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds rouge leader Ta Mok in a classroom with dirty and flaking walls which is weakly lit and concreted to the later cambodian of the man who has built him .
`` Ta Mok loves everybody here . ''
`` He was a good leader and he has taken care of his people '' said strictly chose Ma for 42 years .
Because of his brutality during the cambodians ' rouge power known as `` the butcher '' the commander remains popular in these remote former cambodians ' rouge stronghold in the northwest of Cambodia , he have hospitals and bridges developed built , the infrastructure and where thousands more formerly still live soldiers where .
But long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng this year , 12 years after the surrender of the cambodians rouge opposite the government .
In April , a local truth and reconciliation forum permitted the victims the public confrontation with the people who have supported the regime once .
The government distributed a schoolbook , this the story of the cambodians rouge told to children of former soldiers for the first time in June .
The former boss of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber , Kaing Khek Iev , and a community tribunal of the UNO and Cambodia sentenced for the first time a former member of the cambodians rouge in July as it , to 35 years in prison sentenced confessed better as .
With each of these developments the fear grew under the cambodian rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs , aggravated her efforts around reconciliation and reintegration to the society of Cambodia .
The documentation centre there still are rejection and fear in the former cambodians ' rouge but they have no power , something `` `` , of Cambodia , an independent organisation which investigates the regime , Chang said to Youk , leader .
`` The life was glorious for her under the cambodians ' rouge but the regime has become a symbol of the bad . ''
`` It splits families itself . ''
During the cambodians ' rouge power in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979 approximately 1.7 million people were executed or they died of illnesses , revision or of hunger .
When the Vietnamese collapsed and brought the pole pot Ied government down in 1979 , the holdovers of the regime and his armed forces fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand .
They spread unrest here until Decembers 1998 as which last movement surrendered .
Pot , Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerilla war of her base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia , Ta Mok consulted the next generation in Anlong Veng as a pole .
But in the middle of the 1990s years large groups of cambodian led to the first democratic elections of the country , started with rouge fighters as a peace agreement 1993 promoted by UNO to the government to overflow , what led to the surrenders of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998 .
Pole pot died a natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok which had not given in was arrested 1999 of government strengths at the Dangrek Mountainss .
He died in prison of Phnom Penh where he waited for his process in 2006 .
When her patrons protected her no more , most former cambodians rouge fighter in the trying poverty of rural Cambodia escaped and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory .
Some reconcile elitist official even if the simple soldiers remained poor , uneducated smallholders cambodians rouge kept her local government positions because they laid her weapons down this one .
`` These people have only very little profited from the surrender '' , said Sok Leang of the centre for justice and reconciliation , this in all of Cambodia , also in Anlong Veng , public fora holds
`` You are established in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime . ''
`` You grew up without any professional knowledge . ''
This one leading himself around a life as a poor rice smallholder before he sat down in 1998 55 years in 1974 when teenager of the Rhmer had attached rouge , fought in the jungle around approval Veng , Sor Lim .
`` The life under the cambodians ' rouge was good '' , he said .
`` Ta Mok has given everybody something to eat . ''
`` The life is hard but now because we must take care of us . ''
The regular cambodians rouge tribunal have worries evoked also here ?
This becomes court try at the beginning of next year to put on trial Nuon Chea , Khieu Samphan , Ieng Sary and his woman as well as Ieng Thirith , another earlier cambodian rouge minister .
The order of the court is to condemn it , the old leaders and those which mainly are responsible for the atrocities , but it is not said , whether it will pursue further deeds out of over these four cases .
This has contributed little to moderate the fears in Anlong Veng .
Current medium speculations have open concentrated in the Chaem for 64 years , this one had been Manteay Meanchey in the province during the cambodians ' rouge power within the late 1970s years district boss .
In 2007 she had told about Cambodia to representatives of the documentation centre , she has conducted the making of the Trapeang dam topic , a project at which thousands of forced labour convicts presumably died .
In a hot evening came back in the Chaem from the work in the fields to her frame-house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng .
As the sun for a long time shade on the withered grass threw declined in the Chaem to discuss her past at the cambodians ' rouge .
If the court should summon her , then she would refuse to go , she said .
`` Cambodia lives into peace and into stability '' , she said .
`` If there were no more followings , war would be here . ''
Prime minister Hun Sen who has fled 1878 of the cambodians ' rouge has accuse although experts and historians discuss this warned in addition repeated it would become the court suspicious of more that the situation would get unsafe .
`` Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past '' , he said .
But what must do Cambodia to be able to come on is the confrontation with the past , Chang Youk of the documentation centre said .
The broken pieces collect reconciliation with the cambodian times meant `` `` , he said .
`` It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that be able to understand like everything . ''
The centre created the first schoolbook approved by the government about the cambodians rouge , the 75-sided story `` of democratic Cambodia '' .
In June , it distributed the book in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the ministry of education which less than four sides contains rouge about the cambodians .
How often in Cambodia do the young people know only some in Anlong Veng about the cambodians rouge despite the connections of the town to the regime ?
Air Valeak , 19 years , a student at the Anlong Veng High School , said that the new schoolbook helps the students to understand an important part of her story .
But his parents reacted sceptically when he brought the book with home to read it .
`` My family declines many parts of the book and the court '' , he said .
`` You are mistrustful because they are not sure as many people are sentenced by the court . ''
Such a resistance puts on reconciliation trial complexly and complicatedly , Sok Leang said .
But the public fora , the schoolbook and the court attain little by little influence `` , he said .
A powerful still has the cambodians rouge attraction here .
Dirty way to a rectangle of black soot , covered with a rusty tin roof carries a overgrown by bushes and with plastic waste above in the Dangrek mountains .
Pot polarize body had been burned after his death in 1998 on a tyre heap here .
Nuom Sothea , 31 years , a mobile telephone seller at the roadside , said she did not know much over the man who had been burned here .
`` He , however , has a strong mind and many people go here to him to pray '' , she said .
She it was Nuom Sotheas birthday and then wanted on the day pot to pole be for last resting-place where she will put bananas a bush down more ripely in the hope that he brings her luck .

The new unity does not find any unanimity
Jean Charest defies the announcement of the possible foundation of a new , stationary unity for the fight against corruption and collusion on the part of furthermore numerous observers demand the formation of a public commission of inquiry to this topic .
Robert Dutil , minister of the public safety , claims this idea does not date from yesterday : Quebec would already have consulted the New York Department of investigation regarding this topic last January .
The metropolis has a stationary unity at its disposal against corruption since 1870 .
The announcement of Wednesday has nevertheless surprised more than only one .
One must say to it that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the permanent committee was discussed not at all the Quebecer police duty despite the presence Robert Dutils on October 29th last year .
Did not there be a lack of it either that Stéphane Bergeron , critic and a member of the Parti Québécois , this announcement qualified as well as `` at a table end made solution `` with respect to public safety as a `` rabbit conjured out of the hat '' .
Minister of Dutil had consulted those for his part in turn which fears that stationary , future unity has the political power too much influence the on .
`` You becoming the result see if we will announce it '' , he settled to confirm .
`` One is conscious of this problem . ''
In accordance with Réjean Parent , the president of the CSQ , nothing can replace the execution of a public survey .
He declared `` people like you and me will the more M. Charest insists on wanting to prevent the formation of this commission of inquiry think the more that he has something to hide '' .
The only means is `` `` , Jean Charest 's resignation Yves Boisvert , assistant professor of ethic and politics systems at Ena ( national university to the education of high civil servants ) , declared for his part so to be able form a commission of inquiry .
To get out of this dead end , he suggests the Quebec to grant finance examination control a special mandate , so that this can make corresponding investigations about corruption and secret arrangements .
`` One should be capable of expanding the mandate of examination control '' , he decided so .
He holds as well the opinion that the Quebec could grant examination control the same power of authority as inspectors which also would permit her to commit people to doing the statement .
The formation of a stationary unity is not the only project Charest in the drawers of the government .
The Quebec will ask as well to amend the Criminal Code to the effect to be adjusted to this way better by crimes of Ottawa .
This demand is from the public prosecutor of the operation Marteau who has informed the Lord Chancellor Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisdiction is not clear in this way of the criminal prosecution .
Vic Toews , state minister for a public safety confirmed for his part , at present , his colleague has a good look at amendments which are certain and concerning this dossier of the justice , Rob Nicholson .
131 persons had been arrested during the operation Printemps 2001 which concerned the groups of the motorcycle policemen although the Criminal Code had not been amended .
Ottawa has succeeded with the law because of this one against gangsterism .

In addition , he executed , some plans of several years already have been tackled or locked , both those , these were financed by the Chinese government which monies got from other countries and such .
He referred for the effective use of energy , to the programme , for example , which was introduced within the last five years and investments of the united nations ( UNO ) , the government and from private hands had got .
A project is it , a far for the exchange of the traditional light bulbs by energy reduction bulbs and a far one for the drop and customization , going on also onto province level to the climate change he declared .
Martin Krol , scientific adviser to the government in the area of climate change in this country , confirmed that the efforts of China are far bigger than you would assume generally .
He showed , that the per capita issue of greenhouse gases is six tons per person in China while it is 100 tons in the United States . China is responsible for a nine per cent complete contribution to pollution .
It just makes unprecedented progress in the area of the energetic use . The energy effectiveness was increased by twenty per cent within the last five years and he explained a rest shall happen up to the year 2020 .

Euro : The ECB is forced to keep her purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the board of a central bank of the ECB last year should offer opportunity to show possibilities which shall come to her completion at the end of the year as one gets out of the crisis or announce at least the order of a large number at unconventional measures of the financial policy .
The crisis of the European national debt engages , the central bank in Frankfurt undoubtedly can not afford it , also today 's more but to forfeit a tense situation on the European bond markets to not cause the worsening .
The political costs would be far too high .
The French Chancellor of the Exchequer Christine Lagarde had welcomed the role yesterday on the occasion of a press conference which is taken by the ECB and active in favour of the solution of the national budget indebtedness of Europe .
She has not dared to say , whether she is of the opinion , the central bank still can do more , for example by pump priming of her programme of the purchases of government bonds .
`` I keep my considerations for my European trading partners in front of ( ... ) '' .
On the day before , Jean-Claude Törichte , president of the ECB had not rather settled regarding his plan shown but himself very eloquently in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the economy and monetary committee of the European Parliament to point out that the programme of the purchases of government bonds would be on the after market `` on-going uses '' we `` see '' during the meeting being on Thursday how the decisions turn out and that .
Only certainty : The ECB will unchanged leave her key interest rate at 1 % , the historically lowest standard since May 2009 .
The purchases of bond of the treasure vault of the ECB were doubled last week on approximately 1.35 billion euros in the practice .
And according to the indiscretions of some dealers she shall have completed new purchases yesterday at Irish and Portuguese government bonds .
Altogether , the central banks of the euro system have carried out purchases in the amount of 67 billion euros since May 2010 .
The anticipation becomes follow up the call price doubted under no circumstances ( see page 29 ) one under the dealers .
The economists already expect no more remarkable change of course .
If the loan business of over three months will already have disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB , gets himself still give the absolute funds reserves no end of trouble in a bounteous way and to be more precise over a period of a week up to three months on the latter .
The economists brace themselves already today that this measure still will extend by some months .
`` I can not imagine that the ECB will amend her programme in an essential way '' .
`` She would otherwise take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short run '' , suspected for Michael Schubert , economist of Commerzbank , so .
`` An exit which is provided for the course of the first quarter 2011 and progressive '' more probably seems to me , anticipates Norbert Bräms , economist with Sal , for his part .
Oppenheim .
The ECB should in the area of her interventions on the market of the national debt `` such a purchase volume of bonds which stimulates the sluggish market keep up `` , Norbert Bräms adds .
In consideration of the relevance of the prominent position of the European banks on the markets of the national debt in the euro zone the central bank does not have another election but to keep her presence on the market .
`` She must step and act so much at every price to the Steller of the lacking investors on the market to prevent the rash enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states '' , attested yesterday one important bond owner .
The interest rates set for the high-altitude flight , the states still would be prevented more to reduce her indebtedness or also only to stabilize because if .
This is the price to the protection of the euro .

Gesta PRD , PT , Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law about the convention the two-party system is introduced lament her .
Just had started with the 60th legislative period and an opposition block already installed itself , specified by the representatives of the PRD , PT , Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo , which introduced himself as independent . The four questioned the following : The move of the 'two-party system ' into the chamber .
Before the beginning of the introduction meeting in the 60th legislative period cursed for Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia , Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT , Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the organ law , since they would be excluded by it .
With this reform they repeated , a 'two-party system ' would be introduced , because these would be two persons , the same number as parties which checked the convention , now .
These four representatives together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar , coordinator the PRD , were the only ones who voted against the committee led by the pianist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cardenas Fonseca in his quality as an acting chairman .
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties PRI and pan would have introduced her political edge position institutionally with these reforms .
He executed , that they would talk to the representatives of pan and PRI within the next days to change the scheme . The opposition coalition they started out from the political will and , if they did not have this one , they would be subjugated by the two parties again , with what an end would be set .
`` To here I ( the opposition coalition ) come , this is what I see , take into account because we are excluded from all decisions , do even not take this one away from considerations on this , the opinion , the left . ''
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained there would be agreements with PRD , PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed .
It can not be allowed , he continued that the convention , after he was monopolistic , shall be `` duopolistic '' now .
`` It is not the spirit of the law reform that in the convention an eternal two-party system shall be . ''
`` For the beginning this group starts with five representatives and they talk to further colleagues so that they get more '' , explained the Convergencia member .
The PT executed Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of , that in allusion to pan and PRI the convention has converted himself to 'spoils ' for two at present .
`` It was only a party before , they are sharing these in a twosome open now . ''
Patrón Montalvo applied to respect the representatives and to assign her place to them at the negotiating tables .
`` It you may not let go in front on the outside due to top decisions five which probably will be nine representatives . The five have decided to unite to take our seat at the negotiating table , this one felt at present split up than in different parliamentary groups be , we have with reform which was carried out and arranged by the others stayed outside and we are not agreeable to this reform because due to he .

Puigcercós is looking for peace with being close to a wink to the Carod in the ERC
The republican leader permits the party a secret coordination on his continuing in the office .
Huguet suggests a more pluralistic government and the end of the general meeting principle .
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe , around for the umptieth time of one this one to go ERC lacking a sense of direction in the rows after the loss of 11 representatives and the half of the votes from the way internal riot .
The party leader is conscious that the former party leader 's Joseph Lluís Carod-Rovira does not suffice his threat to resign the being close . But he also knows that , today , the influence of this sector is weakened just like her mentor will not grant themselves and him the same headache , how other former flows .
Therefore the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink which his position until the next local elections would safeguard .
Yesterday , for the beginning announced on , that the over 200 regional fellow counsellors of ERC could speak secretly about his remaining in the office .
Hand not raised with ballot-papers .
If the parodists wanted to miss the president a ticket , they could do this without having to fear reprisals .
The boss would actually like to avoid the impression of splitting and the one of submission under his person both .
In several interviews he confirmed he would feel not confirmed with the half of the votes plus one and he added without detail of per cent values , a result would not be good `` in the Bulgarian style '' either .
The being close to Carod demands of the president more but to provide only the party with his office . An insufficient gesture , since Puigcercós checks the topmost organ of the conventions .
But since they do not have a sufficient majority at their disposal for the formation of resignations , they will agree on a procedure plan of now with the executive board until May .
For this they expect the line at the draft of the document about a strategic reorientation to want to present to the council for the coordination on 18th to be able to play a part .
It is your intention to guarantee Puigcercós . In return what the party leadership already regards as a fact shall promise to bring the convention forward in autumn 2011 .
The party leader of the ERC is of the opinion , the `` polyphony '' harms the stability and he strives once and for all to bring about the organisation to the position , to wash her dirty laundry behind closed doors .
The article is , in this meaning this one the incumbent Conseller Joseph Huguet signed blog symptomatically in his .
The Puigcercós is in view of this one , an ideologue the owner of Innovació regarded as a fact that the party leader is supported `` in the exchange for different aims '' .
He listed five , of which two are in the foreground .
The `` restructuring '' of the executive board firstly , the inclusion of new faces is so that this represents at least 90 per cent of the party members , that called environment from Carods .
The second could be the great news .
Suggests Huguet , ERC shall finally give up the general meeting principle as an operation .
He defends a reform with that of the statutes which shall make it possible to hold the conventions with delegates voted for .
Of the completion of the general meeting model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós ' is team which already fought at the last two conventions for it as had .
The party leaders were actually engaged to do the check of the general meeting principle at a convention at the shaking meeting of 2008 which should deal with the reformation of the statutes .
This appointment is still due since because of the internal on-quiet of the last years concerning this matter was not advisable .
Sectors are lying in wait without the critical one now , the time could have come to take up again and complete for ever this matter .

Can politeness do this dividing connect ?
After a campaign at swearwords and negativism this week little politeness has broken out in Washington .
Is it the omen of a real cooperation between two parties or a moment of the illusion , before one returns fast again to the fight of the parties in the capital ?
The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and tops of the convention did not bring about any breakthrough lame in the great questions one himself duck session the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are taken , with which during the so-called `` `` , to employ had .
All this what one hears , it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an attention of her split to rule over responsibility after , but one rather empties episode of a biassed point collection .
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was likewise civilized despite the political differences which there furthermore are between the members .
It the ideological ravine seems to be clear that a narrow interaction over a period of months lets a mutual respect arise , furthermore to it the members of each other this one separate veiledly .
This is hardly enough to claim it has opened a new era of the cooperation .
Both sides are in a test stage now - in this one the one of the other sign of the cooperation and willingness to compromise calls in while one is trying to weigh up the bounds of the public opinion and the patience of the electors after a renewed party warfare himself .
Were therefore the meeting itself on Tuesday and to demands or accusations his assessment by the participants open limits a minimum .
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too big and too deep in that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere which prevailed within the last two years .
It is about taxes , donations , health or candidacies , the two sides are for miles and miles remote from each other identical whether .
The November election has in the end Washington for short time at least mild voted .
No question , the intonation have changed `` `` which works , Pete Wehner , an official representative of the Bush government , said , for the `` Ethics and PUBLIC Policy centre '' now .
`` This is unavoidable after elections .
Elections arouse biassed passions which die again .
And this is so well . ''
This one duck session `` lame `` in some questions particularly in these , this one on the agenda , stand , have hardly another election republicans and democrats but to find a solution . ''
Bushs tax reductions end at the end of the year and nobody approves this .
Both sides claim to find a way , around some or even everyone to gets , it to be temporary or durable now .
A compromise has as well to be expected regarding the increased unemployment benefit , if also only lasting because the republicans can not afford it that one thinks these favoured tax reductions for the rich they refuse unemployed workers a support .
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House the optimism has increased , that in these questions during this one `` one duck session `` reach an agreement himself and lame can ratify the new start contract also .
The Brookings institution warns but a successful cooperation in urgent questions of the lame does not `` that , have William Glaston duck session to lead to a durable cooperation of the parties mandatorily , if the new 112th convention is called in January .
He says so , a phase of the non-compliance is more probably , perhaps even inevitable instead .
He `` will after the things which must be done are done turn this short-term psychology over in confrontation '' , said .
Wehner is also sceptical , and this scepticism is shared by many - this leads politeness to a real cooperation .
I see much which happens from today to 2012 him when pre-fight or shadow-boxing said for the main event of 2012 `` `` .
For this many have to do with the presentation of the new republican majority in the White House and the reasons with the tea party electors these were useful to the education .
Being allowed to be the republican leaders also about this as got that they too highly play poker , they know that they must have a try to observe her promises to cut the expenses of the government and to suspend the health care reform .
These party lines already get clear in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the deficit commission which contain a tax reform and the raise some taxes as well as the increase in the retirement age and the cut the public expenditure .
The acting chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have pressed in accordance with her own assessment so much to put the deficit question on the public agenda that these can not be ignored any more .
But they need within the commission 14 of the 18 votes around her plan to make an official recommendation and they fight very much to this one to also only come this number into the proximity .
The greatest resistance is found in the representatives of the committee voted for since only little room to move or some are liking in questions of finance , at least today for compromises .
Alston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the republicans in the convention .
Later , the first fight then will followed by a phase 's greater bilateral cooperation take place in the form of party collisions next year if the republicans challenge Obama with regard to the national budget , the taxes and the health care system .
What will lead to this change ?
The public opinion .
It is proved that the American still wants the majority despite the partiality of the current election that the two parties work together .
If confrontation leads into a dead end as it has happened in 1995 , then both parties must pay attention to the public reaction carefully .
Who is always condemned to losing , too will have to change the course and to seek the compromise .
This may be an optimistic position indeed .
As at that time , partiality and polarization are greater than in the middle of the 1990s years today and they seem between president Bill Clinton and the republicans to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the convention republicans .
2012 consider the activists of both parties 2010 a pure prelude for one to consequence of far further-reaching Wahl at the same time .
So seen the politeness which is carried this week for the show may be welcomed by many Americans .
But it will require very much more effort on the two sides to find a common denominator in the questions which the two still separate from each other .

A bone house fascinates also after 100 years . You have a look the interior from fun
The roof appears like the back of a prehistoric lizard , the stairs like the spinal column of a dinosaur and the balconies are fish mouths torn up .
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona .
Of the local inhabitants the house got the nickname `` bone house '' with his organic forms .
Organic forms , wild colours , the unusual use of stone , glazed tile splinters and mosaic , lines move the to façades reminding sheds and ubiquitous , typical features are all this for the Art Nouveau of Antonio Gaudi .
The façade of the house plays with wonderful lines , tender colours and textures which remind of nature and living beings .
Only when looking more exactly one remarks that everything is mastered by geometry , rhythm and thought-out order .
In the night works the whole façade still more plastically , more dramatically and the special lighting still strengthens the gleam of the colours .
Forms also master the inside of the house the same sweeping lines and gobbled up .
Wave-likely formed wood copies the window frames , banisters , decorating elements of doors , yes even peepholes and last .
The house Batlló in the quarter Eixample at the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia no . 43 was made from the rebuilding of a house from the year 1877 which Emilio Sala Cortese executed for architects .
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906 .
Originally the investor , the prosperous industrialist Joseph Batlló , insisted on the demolition of the old and the making of a completely new building but he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper reorganisation at long last .
The block of rented flats Casa Batlló , however , did not design Antoni Gaudí by itself .
He cooperated at this with the architect Joseph Maria Jujol .
The decorations arose just on the drawing-board for the representative flat of the real estate owner and his idea was also the use of mosaics at the façade .
A however also numerous further creator and artist collaborated in the design of the façade .
The common work on the outlines for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí .
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell in which also further works are located in Antoni Gaudí .
Already shortly after his completion the house of the local inhabitants got the nickname `` bone house '' because of his organic forms .
In turn others called it the `` yawning house '' because of the special window opening mechanism .
One also says the sword of Saint Georg , the patron saint is represented by Catalonia on the building right at the top .
But also further sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives .
Gaudí designed a central heating system unique for the time then for the house with venting channels and typical fireplaces .
Her 45 degree inclination already appears a little bizarre .
In the field of his work Gaudí ignored consistently all construction specifications then and let himself be put off by these not at all .
Before start of building he caught up of the town with the corresponding planning and building permission but the details made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers were so horrified of the result at the completion two years later , that they required remedy .
Among other things the councillors also disapproved of it , that the making even intruded on the public pavement with his pillars .
To changes it did not come quite the reverse any more , though , Joseph Batlló made an application to the approval of the letting out of the two most situated stories of the house only fifteen days after the request of the district regarding this , and she was assigned to him promptly .
The house-owner himself moved into the lower floors .
A society parlour was located in the gallery in the 2nd floor , the bedrooms and private rooms of the flat were located in the third floor .
The ground floor was leased to a jeweller 's shop .
The complete six-storied building passes through stairs to the housetop terrace to up .
By the fundamental elements of the reorganisation became all right angles and straight lines removes and by turned and swung walls replaces .
However , Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms .
The social part can be connected completely by opening the drawing-room doors and a larger society could talk comfortably so without having to do without a certain intimacy during more confidential conversations .
Reorganisation also got a quite unusual roof and another two stories the house by Gaudís apart from a new façade .
And the air wells impressively is , also Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles glazed the inner courtyard is covered with these .
The game of these two colours awards a maximum amount of light to all floors of the house .
He made use simply , that the light reflects whitely better of the principle when dark colours which on the contrary absorbs the sunlight to this .
The 2005 into the world heir list of the Unesco the house Casa Batlló you took , can pay a visit to everyone today .
The most spacious and most splendid flat is accessible to the public on the first floor made .
The house-owners decided in for these step and this on occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator first .
When one noticed that one quite lucrative business is one kept the inspections the housetop terrace , one stretched her also on further common ones and the attic storey rooms , inclusive out .
The price for the inspection of the historical monument is not a chicken feed , though , he is 16,50 euros , students , pensioners , groups and holders of tourist identity cards get 20 per cent reduction .
This amount surpasses the admission charges in the town to other Gaudí buildings .
Who did friendship with one of the occupants of the house would like to get to know the genuine atmosphere of the house with his hang-glider turrets , should have a try ?

An older stocky man just leaves the client centre of the society RPG Byty of the `` coal baron '' Zdenek Bakala , the tallest private owner of rented flats in Czechia .
Under the arm a briefcase with three new leases to three flats : For the own one and the flats of his daughters and his son who just serves a prison sentence .
All three just became increases the rent in the context of the so-called `` deregulation '' .
The son shall pay 4100 crowns instead of of 3500 crowns monthly rent for a 2 room flat with kitchen of the second category next year .
`` And '' there is not fluently warm water in the flat and one must heat in a simple coal stove there he guesses annoyedly the new lease of the son to whose signing he has a power with the finger .
I have signed `` but what - `` , he explains half disgruntledly and half resigns .
The citizen union BytyOKD.cz which described the new letting conditions as `` incorrect and immoral '' advises the tenants not to sign simply and to service until December 7th on which she intends to publish instructions the new contracts as one proceeds against such contracts .
But the man only puts off .
One says `` `` , this , the different one this he makes a dark face .
The region Ostrava becomes the large `` deregulation laboratory '' so .
After New Year this deregulation is still to come in Czechia for most rented flats whose tenants do not pay rent in conformity with the market till now .
Aktuálne.cz decided therefore to go to this `` laboratory '' personally .
The RPG waiting room in Havírov is breaking for one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday full .
The bodygards of a safety agency stand and at her a call device just next to the door .
`` 2011 rents '' , a special feeling field shines on the touch screen so .
Tapped briefly and the device already spits a number piece of paper out .
We have hardly decoded the number `` 157 '' and she already cheeps on the big display at the ceiling of the waiting room .
Half a second later it is his turn .
An older married couple enters the waiting room a little later to ask for the rent but the rush in the waiting room is not apparently for the new rent at all .
Repair applications , insurance matters are here most people to solve the usual problems - and similar .
As of the middle of November flutter the envelope with the new leases most tenants of the altogether 44.000 flats of the portfolio in the region Ostrava the RPG into the post-boxes .
The RPG Byty suggests them a rent increase of approx . 15 to 38 per cent in the letters .
The special switch for the new rents in the client centre is opened since November 18th .
`` The action is going on a little over a week , this means this is first the beginning `` the `` client '' turns out , the ladies answer hesitation behind the counter after a moment , to be a journalist as himself .
Former miner flats are an explosive topic the deregulation and Bakalas .
In front of the elections , the parliament vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek being from Ostrava of the CSSD had taken up this topic rather at the top of the voice , no wonder that the newspapers are full of it today .
`` For twenty years I want a new floor of them . ''
`` She no could not replace certificate toilet glasses '' , the man mentioned at the beginning gives vent to himself .
Up till now pensioners queue according to the employees primarily at the switch to convince oneself , whether they really receive the promised renting reduction which promises them RPG , if they sign the special supply on time .
February rent reduced one in the pleasure half being supposed to the other tenants also come , this one sign the new lease until December 15th .
Up till now `` deregulation switch '' is all other things than overtaxed by demands in Havírov , however .
`` About 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 only were from the yesterday 's 360 clients because of here '' , appreciate the counter clerks .
RPG offers , and blackboards individual rental agreements both on her web pages , where it seems necessary .
If the tenant and families , however , should not agree on the new rent , she is fixed by an independent court .
This `` shall not be a threat but is understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure '' , explains RPG on his web pages .
`` Nobody goes here in front of court '' , partly one of the employees of RPG Byty thinks and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her at least properly .
`` I have 13.000 ( crowns pension ) , I have 5.000 left for the meal of this , where I should get the money for a court quarrel `` , he thinks .
The employee then gets insecure anyway .
We 'll see .
`` Mr Zaorálek tells their attention they shall not sign and people still wait for so over the media '' , draws to her .
The regulated rent ends in the largest portion of Czechia at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity .
The existing amount of the rents `` does not '' suffice for the maintenance of the living fund the neglect criticized by the outraged tenants of the flat fund is just the main reason for the rent increase in opinion of the house-owners and - , argued for Pavel Klimeš , the director of the flat portfolio of the society RPG Byty .
Being supposed to it be 5.2 billion within the four years from 2011 to 2014 while RPG could invest four billion in the flats from the earned rents within the years between 2005 and 2010 .
Some couple of red shining information appears on the large-sized LCD display at the ceiling opposite the armchairs in the waiting room of Havírov in between times again and again .
`` The rent increases in 2011 by 15 % and less concern 31 200 flats , this is called more than 90 % of the flats of RPG . ''
`` This always means not more than CZK 7.50 per square metre and month '' , has to be read on the LCD monitor .
Only for 400 flats from the portfolio of RPG the rent increases by 38 per cent .
`` It is all about the rise of extremely low rents from 19,66 CZK per square metre in these cases '' , argues RPG .
The rent stays with 2600 flats next year on the same level .
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rents by leaps and bounds in the height but is gradually carried out within four and eight years .
The enterprise imposes another obligation on himself what more - : The enterprise wants to invest all takings from the rent increase ( see diagram ) in the flats primarily in warmth savings into new windows and into the insulation again .
But these shall as a matter of priority people be of benefit to the ones , this one sign the agreements on the rent increase .

The `` green '' label is not inspiring confidence barometer of responsible consumption
Green but frankly sceptical .
The Quebecers ' consumer has little confidence in the dominant players of the sustainable growth , for the labelled brands or the environmental identifications which shall steer his election however just as little .
Harm although it takes a bath in a mediagenic universe , where it teems of information in favour of a more responsible consumption only in such a way : The barometer of responsible consumption has to lament a lack of credible information , an insufficiency which makes itself recognizable as a horsefly of his engagement as the first reading which was held yesterday pointed .
Seeming the Quebecers to give little credit nevertheless to the ones who try to sell these although they have advanced consumption of the so-called socially wholesome products in 2010 .
The environmental engagement of the companies to believe just as little like the green enterprise advertising admits two thirds of the Quebecers population , indeed , the measuring instrument worked out by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke betrays so .
Other results : The half of the consumers doubts the trustworthiness of the certificates which are official and attached to the putatively fair products but also the reliability of the products and brands which declares themselves as environment-conscious the barometer so .
After the same sample the discourse of the politicians is taken seriously to this topic of merely 14.6 % of the Quebecers population .
The information with regard to a responsible consumption seems nevertheless importantly to the stimulation of this consumption segment , of at present approaching this only one third of the Quebecers consumers is stimulated .
Emptiness and doubtful character of the information indeed muffled the enthusiasm of 46 % of the consumers .
This is the second after the higher price of the products , horsefly identified on the part of the barometer .
In addition , a third of the Quebecers is mistrustfully confronted with the given efficiency of the green products and services which one tries to his hand to put for them .
According to another communication had already changed her habits about the half of the consumers in 2010 and the brand of one or several changed products mainly to express her conviction .
They had preferred also to 61 % purchases with dealers of her district and favoured the purchase of food cultivated in her region according to the barometer .
The index of environment-conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the peak value of 100 green and responsible - - this year the homo consumus of the Quebec loves it , themselves as a king present recycling , this one reduce tempted , his in traces left to the environment , by caring about the protection of animals .
But the barometer seems the social and ecological consciousness nevertheless of stopping at his car , so : Even 28 % of the Quebecers have claimed to have used or preferred the car sharing agency in 2010 public transport to demonstrate her ecological interest .
The going on foot as well as cycling were also approved of 39.1 % of the participants of this comprehensive behaviour survey which eats the clichés .

Ivory Coast expects excitedly the announcement of the election results
UNO Secretary General ban Ki-Moon has demanded the `` immediate '' publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast directly after the expiration of time .
`` The Secretary General underlines the necessity of the independent electoral commission to receive her work and to announce the temporary results without further delay '' , a press agent of the UNO boss emphasized so .
`` He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to give proof of her responsibility and to abstain from every initiative up to the proclamation of the temporary results . ''
Despite the pressure put on the part of certain foreign governments the electoral commission had let , three days after the choice on Sunday , put the deadline which was fixed for Wednesday around midnight without publication of the results .
About forty minutes from expiration of time the president had confirmed on television to the CEI that the commission would `` continue with the work '' to announce the results .
On Wednesday multiple calls have got loud from the whole world , the CEI finally may exclaim the name of the winner of the second round of the balloting under letting Ouattara from the Laurent Gbagbo separating office and his opponents anyway .
The Gbagbo camp expects , however , the cancellation of `` deceitful '' votings in the north by the constitutional advice which were obtained by the former rebel camp the Forces Nouvelle ( FN ) during the revolt failed in September 2002 .
Guessan , leader of the presidency campaign of the Ivory Coast , had Pascal Affi N confirmed to the election that the manoeuvres practised on the part of the FN had deterred the supporters of the president to the intimidation of the electors in the north of the country ' to go .
The complete election could be annulled if the complaints inserted by Gbagbo are taken into account by the constitutional advice .
More of the opinion that the highest court of justice of the country is not neutral are the Gbagbo opponents , however , now , there he is conducted of Paul Yao N ' politically narrowly obliged to Dré , one for Gbagbo .
Letting Ouattara , man of the north which denies each contact to the former rebels , has judged the delay in the proclamation of the election results when `` unacceptable '' and asked Gbagbo to respect these even if he has not gone so far to call in the victory .
His allies confirm Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results , since he knows that he has lost ; and submitting a complaint ahead of the constitutional court , after one has prevented the electoral commission to publish the results , be illegal .
Became the second round of the presidential elections on Sunday regarded as the culmination of the process of union and reconciliation of a country which was split into two parts over years .
The united nations had warned the politicians of the Ivory Coast on Wednesday she can be kept responsible for these in the case of possible riots .
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of the balloting this one , on October 31st with 38 % of the votes toward the 32 % for letting Ouattara the public support of the former president enjoyed Henri Konan Bédié ( 25 % in the first round ) , brought as a favourite candidate behind himself .

Reprimanded for Dupont partly
The Quebecers ' broadcast presenter Stéphane Dupont has one partial setback suffered in front of the Canadian supervisory board for broadcast norms ( CCNR ) because of his controversial remarks over social casework and Haitians just like because of his impertinent talk way over radio .
The CCNR holds the opinion M. Dupont and his Choi 98.1 cbm team would have the right to an expression of opinion of one 's own , would have certain remarks , though the Haitian as well as also such an unplaned talk way which is not adequate to the shipments broadcast during the day `` contain '' inaccurate information about the social casework and unauthorizedly negative representations
The supervisory board also had end drawn a conclusion that the distribution of the names two persons contained which has committed suicide violates a discussion about suicide , this one , the codex of the programme transmission .
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the shipments broadcast in the period of 2008 and 2010 .
This one became the first disposal front common the persons assistées because of a complaint `` social you Quebec `` inserted .
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the shipment are inaccurate .
The presenters should rather assign solidly as a misleading information .
With regard to the suicide topic presenter Stéphane Dupont had held the opinion , the suicide is an expression of cowardice .
The conclusion drawn , it is the switched embassy that suicide may not be considered as solution by personal crises , had the majority of the supervisory board members .
`` This one would have stationary results of the shipment Dupont Le the majority of the supervisory board taken into account , that `` midi `` touched on a sensitive topic in a suitable for families and suitable way . ''
He was therefore covered with a no reproach opposite his person .
Contentious issue concerned the statements which had referred to the earthquake in Haiti the last .
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a mediagenic debate to himself regarding this , that a set of reactions has caused .
The Choi presenter had professedly , not in favour of the Haiti help to have donated , since one would not know certainly whether the needy ones also really would get the donations .
The supervisory board thinks that these comments of not improper character have been , that her cumulative effect presents an unauthorizedly negative representation of the Haitians , however .
`` I have already served my three-day suspension punishment in this thing . ''
`` My file has been virgin for one and a half years '' , explained the presenter .
In all decisions the supervisory board denounces the distribution of an unplaned mode of expression .
The Choi cbm of radio announcers has in any case acted `` on the other side of his obligations '' .
The consequences for the radio transmitter which among other things had once been supposed to inform about his decisions during the prime time within a period of three days are insignificant .

The F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens speaks Bull wins in
The cars are improved with a software in real time .
Talk since Bull 2004 penetrated into the world of the formula 1 , her story in this exquisite universe of the speed of surprises and successes is marked .
At first nobody gave the newcomer attention and despite his steeply ascending career during the last seasons everyone set at the final spurt in last November on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso .
Without wanting to reduce the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the high performance of the engine of Renault the `` secret weapon '' is , this one talk the multinational Siemens Bull put in her hands and a winner team created with that , become a legend .
In reality is an efficient software for the simulation from processes which the German enterprise put 2007 on the market for purposes which do not have to do with motor racings .
This computer science programme described as a PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factories at the whole world , energy works and high-precision instruments .
Aimed there is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this is actually built to avoid faults and superfluous costs so .
PLM has made the development of the cameras of Canon , the aeroplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan easier .
Siegfried Russwurm , head of the industry department of Siemens , professed , talk that , `` within few hours , almost in real time '' , Bull can factory - with the use of this software in the formula 1 design and execute the changes and improvements which is established on the runnings and at the tests .
Russwurm takes out , that on an average ten technicians who could introduce not more than three or four improvements in a season worked in the racing stables in 1992 .
Talk into 180 highly qualified young people are busily Bulls team today . They would drive analyses and all possible changes with efficient EDP equipments through to the racing car .
The Siemens manager explained the PLM software is able of talk analyse and improve Bull with the exception of the engine for which responsible to exclusively Renault explains oneself , all components of the racing cars .
The materials , the fuel , the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed .
The changes can be transferred thanks to progressive production plants and high tech autoclaves within some as 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulator into the reality .
The 40 million dollars , the one formula 1 , are the only limit which is set to this crazy technical perfectionism - race may distribute team for his in a season .
Talks Bull has built up his high tech factory for the development and production of his racing cars in a place 50 kilometres remote from London .
It is two buildings in which visits are localized strongly particularly of journalists .
Everything which happens there is top Secret .
The staff embraces 580 persons including the two pilots , the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber .
But talk a true formula 1 Bulls - hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell .
Behind the enormous technological resources put that one of the Energy drink manufacturers into the services of his participation on the racetracks , further protagonists hide , zero is the support incalculable and the fame at once .
The technological the work , Steve Nevey , emphatic , one , that one still could say five years ago , that the progress contributed to the victory for racing cars with 50 per cent in the area of F & E and the pilots were responsible for the rest .
The share values have changed today . The technology makes up 85 per cent of the success while the contribution of the pilots is valued at 15 per cent .
Nevey appreciates that Vettel and Webber can be never replaced by EDP , because they `` are not predictable gladiators '' .

The trace of the stones
Which one does have himself Uli Gsell 400 kilos gottenly , altogether approximately also ?
He stood on the Monday evening in front of the Stuttgart station , the tuba on the back .
It was demo .
It snowed .
The story is known : The excavators had advanced in September and had started to stop a large piece of the north grand piano .
The same was not the Stuttgart world any more : Demonstrated against S21 , the lowering of the station worth a few billion , tens of thousands .
When it came to the building freeze , a large part of the grand piano lay in ruins .
Broken in 6000 , 7000 piece .
A Crailsheim Muschelkalk , a soft coarse stone , between 1914 and 1920 obstructed .
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern 43 years oldly .
He has himself the chunk protected itself couple of one .
`` These stones are relics . ''
`` You must n't disappear . ''
He swarms : `` A cheap and poor stone , simple and earth custody . ''
When he sawed one , this one has smelled of cigarette fug .
He does not know yet what he will do with the chunks .
Stones have time .
Uli Gsell also .
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads to a former ammunition depot of the French army where Manuel Rongen has set up his stone empire to woods at Tuebingen .
The 44-year-old trades in old stones .
He has bought everyone whom attacked at the demolition in Stuttgart .
`` It would be a disgrace , they would be ground to gravel or in the dump disappear '' , he says in his office , a wood hut which was once a little guardhouse .
Swears and threatens one has him , he tells stories when in this September was in the newspapers that he has bought the remains of the north grand piano of the demolition contractor .
But he has talked with the S 21 opponents for days .
And he has explained to them that he really can for the demolition do nothing at all now .
And , if it happens now once , then it is the most sensible anyway if the stones were continued to use .
About 200 s 21 opponents took one this one on average cuboid heavy 80 kilos , unit price 6.50 to 14 euro after that .
However , being able to some give him back also in the hope at a reconstruction as a souvenir .
Rongen had bought 500 tons , 25 big lorry cargo loads .
Approximately the half is still stored in the woods , the rest is sold already .
Owner of a garden , landscape gardener , private developer .
They have come and would have dragged away , what boot and caravans could carry of everywhere .
The Stuttgart bones of contention have changed into `` Mäuerle '' long ago or into limitations of herb beds .
`` This stone is actually nothing special '' , says Rongen .
`` The political component would not be . ''
He climbs into his cross-country vehicle , makes a tour of his 20 hectares empire .
He has studied law and broken off then he has been interested in computers and finally has become stone dealers , late biology .
And stone enthusiast .
he stores 40000 tons of stones .
He carts his treasures from all of Germany together .
He says he is the greatest old stone dealer of the republic .
He brakes .
Sandstones hewed artistically lie in the snow .
`` You belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke once '' , he says .
Elbe sand stone yellow , warm , he , swarms .
`` My favourite stone . ''
It goes up the way through the woods .
He points at a heap : Red sandstone , early part of the Karlsruhe station .
And .
`` Beautiful travertine . ''
The cuboids were part of the platform of the Stuttgart Neckar stadium once .
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories , Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters , reddish granite out of the cathedral Sankt Blasien , tuff of the Heilbronn hospital .
Which work , which efforts , which sweat .
If Rongen thinks as the stones were hit by hand and moved with simple block and tackles and ox carts earlier gets he quite reverent .
`` It would be a scandal anyway if one would something like that become shredders . ''
He richly does not have become , stinking rich already not at all .
But 14 people employed of the stone dealers have today , in addition set up above in the woods stonemasons , a sculptor , a blacksmith , a glassblower and a horticulturist .
`` We work hard but it is satisfactory '' , says the rest dismantler and recycler .
He must to Cologne soon .
Also there there is to save stones .

Europeans think about the development of the anti crisis measures
It had still particularly stressed Christine Lagarde in the context of a press conference in Paris yesterday : `` I think one still has proved it on the Sunday afternoon as well as also in the evening : The Europeans hold together obviously , are ready and dedicated to defend her currency as well as her monetary area `` .
Relative - the discount drawn wrong yesterday in the interest rates of the European government securities completely was although water on the mills of the governments as well as the ECB .
A normalization beginning can not be the talk , however , yet .
The credit rating agency standard & Poor had announced she can reduce the fault remark of Portugal , the probably most effective target of the speculators nowadays .
Like in May an honest defect `` passes '' to clarity and more politically perceivability the opinion the economists the Exane BNP Paribass which particularly lays on the banking systems , so .
Primarily , the political time `` passes '' especially much more slowly than that one of the markets .
The European countries which are probably conscious of both this ravine and the danger which hides into this intensify the discussions for the reinforcements of the already available anti crisis measures .
The informal consultations between the Chancellors of the Exchequer most directly concerned and in the broader sense with her opposite numbers of the G20 go on well .
And this also into regard on the meetings of euro Group and the Ecofin beginning of next week .
The ECB meets today .
On the plan the lot of the unconventional measures for the moral support of the countries of the euro zone is in the cross-lines of the markets ( see below ) .
The executive director Klaus Regling has already on Tuesday so what concerns the EU stability funds his Asia tour in Singapore started to inform the investors about the developments with regard to the crisis in the Far East in Europe .
If although aim of his visit is not express Fundraising , then he surely prepares this to this the land .
The first Werpapierausgaben on the part of the EU stability fund are planned for next month .
This one had entrusted an official American representative of the agency of Reuter , yesterday this one by the additional one , direct engagement of the IMF mobilized fund supported a possible increase for United States .
Portugal and Spain , the countries in first row , prepare for their part to take on too much particularly in the area of the labour market organisation , structural reforms .
Reforms which join the economy measures , being supposed to show however effects in the nearer future .
Lisbon and Madrid walking along another way when Greece and Ireland have done this .
Both the one and means much to avoid at every price to this which in the long run brings them the confidence back having to ask for an international support before they have built her own budget correctives and decided on inevitable structural reforms to the other one .
In turn the European capital owners talk about the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the markets of government bonds .
Axel Weber , this one in Paris was on the journey through on November 24th , had produced the idea first that if the 750 billion mobilized by Europa and the international monetary fund euros would not be enough , the union would not hesitate to grip into the bag of its own once more so .
The economists of Barclays Capital , protagonist completely being in the foreground with regard to the market of the European national debt , judge , of a prolongation would suffice , `` preferably '' by the 100 billion euros in form of a direct liquidity syringe .
This means exists : The European mechanism of a remunerative finance stabilization which is 60 billion euros at present .
An advisory board who has all chances in the European capitals to be examined attentively .
Primarily if the trading conditions get critical .

But the advocates of the law need sixty voices for the adoption of the initiative why they are dependent on the voices of a handful republican . The organisations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intensive influencing control on the adoption of the law at the moment .
The democrats of whom support the majority the Dream Act have 58 seats .
One of them , told from Nebraska to the senator Ben Nelson , though , he would vote against it and only a republican , Richard Lugar from Indiana , has announced his support of the law .
Therefore the defenders of the Dream Acts must get several republicans on her side if other democrats should make up their mind to turn their back on the initiative .
These from Maine , Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins as well as the senator George Lemieux from Florida who took on the brief of the senator Mel Martínez belong to the most courted republicans .
Further republicans explain who supported the Dream Act in the past , are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas , however , did they not supporting it on another occasion any more .
One , till now , further republican who had voiced in favor of the law , John McCain , has not fixed his attitude yet .
The House of Representatives has another version , this the analysts agree on it although the Dream Act is in the senate with the biggest obstacles .

Putting the finger in the wound with literature
'The desire at the language ' was a walk at which the participants made themselves strong for the story the second round of
`` Yes , I understand this with the sex in the language , but ... The finger in the wound ? What is expected by me ? `` , a cycle asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela who should open the second round of 'lot placeres de of La lengua ' , which the Spanish speaking literature celebrated and on this occasion the subtitle of her question used ( she explained the round 's table was dedicated to the sex in the language on another event ) ?
`` The finger in the wound ... takes us to difficulties '' , the Argentine spat document putting one sweet contrary to the audience , around this which mainly consisted of young people who came together at the international book fair in Guadalajara ( FIL ) of Marisol Shultz in whom Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part , Valenzuela , Sergio Ramírez , to be present at presented rounds table .
Luisa Valenzuela read a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio , and indicated the Shultz after that as an excellent story . Luisa who is the search to learn what is a `` wound '' and goes from doctor to doctor on tells stories in first person and is the protagonist although she receives no answer but notes which for the guide of her story .
She leaves the infectiologists convincedly : `` Patience is not my strength , perhaps this is my wound . ''
For the end after a frustrating approach at the traumatologists which robbed her of the breath in the middle of the corridor , the psychoanalyst and , however , you explain to it that wound is not a scientific concept , revealed , the secret : `` the really open ones , this are the wound symbolic is the scar . ''
The main character of the story sighs relievedly and closes , this she only `` learned from the wound that this is really open and does not exist '' . But she is convinced that the desire at the language and its traps mix .
Valenzuela , the writer , played with both .
The Nicaraguans ' Sergio Ramírez also introduced a delightful story which he called 'praise of the invention ' and although is not mentioned but discovered in that one of the fingers in the wound .
With allusions to the magical realism he talks about a famous magician who touched the clouds , far brought travelled men back or restored the virtue lost by a girl . The story made a three-point turn and reported of America , the big novel which did not lack his own chroniclers from the beginning , this one , and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo of the conquer the abundance this one stories told stories criticized .
`` Cervantes who invited all of us ( the writers ) mocked the story of America , however , would have never been told to the feigned witnesses who appeared in the stories represented as true in another way with imagination which lost even the sense of shame . ''
He stresses , though , `` it is the crazy and liars which imagine the things best '' and reality and lie approach each other there , where one does not know any more of which side the story is part , where the fictitious literature reaches the summit .
He actually calls this the 'tradition Cervantes ' .
`` We have inherited from him what is told to be . ''
When it was Mayra Montero 's turn the writer commented on and praised the variety of the interpretations to which the invitation of the FIl for the round table of 'the fingers in the wound ' had contributed .
The Cuban and puerto rican dedicated her contribution of the big wound of the social force which affects her country - like whole Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug traffic .
`` I think that good literature , good poetry , she explained good songs contain an engagement which is silent and not planned deliberately `` , building this one up between the author and the readers as in the case of a `` chemical reaction '' after she had stressed that literature communication and liability is .
The Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose contribution also stressed `` this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer '' concluded the evening .
He remarked that the intellectual habits and control of the consciousness also come to dogmatisms in a fast-moving world , a small yes that and will forget , `` behind every confirmation a small no stands and behind every denial ``
`` To our thoughts and be the reality in the possession , we must give nuances : Frequently indicates to put the finger in the wound and to annoy those which feels much well and give nuances , he noticed and loaded to rediscover the meaning of the letter if they think in the form of caricatures in black and white in prefabricated ideas without nuances and also the powerful one annoy , this one prefer it , the world in black and white , to divide up .

More and more parents want man monitors to have the kids under control
The worry about the children of one 's own grows and more and more parents consider so to supervise her by GPS .
The system which originally was invented for the search for cars can just as well locate to people namely , what would be helpful also in such cases like recently at the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anika Janatková without trace .
At present , the device is approximately as big as a cigarette box but already soon it might not be bigger than a watch .
The case has given many people to disappeared Anika in fear and frights and they think the lookout to means and ways to protect her children so better .
Also for the price of an impairment of her privacy .
Petr Pilin leads `` we do our best to tell everyone that it is under no circumstances about snooping about but to reduce the probability around an effective means that it comes to the tragedy '' of the society Macro because on , one of the suppliers of GPS locating units on the Czech market .
`` I admit that it can come to the abuse of such an equipment in the individual case for example if one tells it to somebody into the bag without him knowing but we did not have to record such a case till now . ''
`` Most customers really buy it for themselves for safety reasons '' , Pilin adds to .
In his opinion , however , the child should always know which purpose the `` box '' serves and how one if necessary uses her .
The child psychologist Dana Bocková points , however , that a child , if it does not like to carry such a thing , it simply rids itself of him .
`` Also very little children show a great creativity if it is all about to lose certain things deliberately , if they do not want to be checked . ''
`` Already at first great expectations woke the mobile telephones among the parents but let her switch themselves off just as easily like these new monitors '' , thinks Mrs Bocková .
In your opinion is also controversial , whether such a facilities actually help in the case of an attack ?
`` At planned kidnappings the kidnapper always checks practically , whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located to with it . ''
`` It is the mobile telephone today . ''
`` If such monitors were more broadly used , they also would look for these , since her sale would for certain be accompanied by heavy advertising . ''
The criminals are `` always ahead of the police the psychologist thinks a step ahead `` , in these cases .
You fills , however , that a similar equipment can absolutely be helpful at a sudden attack by a pedophile .
Which offers locating services both for motorcars and for persons , the existence of such a device then can help , too if it is immediately after the attack destroyed according to Roberta Cech of the society RC monitoring .
`` The device can be adjusted namely so that it reports the respective position in certain intervals . ''
`` Even if it would be immediately destroyed the last position of the person concerned is at least available . ''
`` Even an inclinometer is integrated at a more expensive equipment , this means if one falls down and is left motionlessly the device immediately sends a warning under detail of the position `` , Mr Cech claims .
In his opinion similar services could carry out also intelligent mobile telephones with navigation , one needs to play in only a special software .
The problem of the present locating units consists in the fact that either it is in matchbox size about equipment either which resembles pendants or around smaller mobile telephones .
There is always the danger so that one loses her .
One therefore tests equipment Mr Pilin of the Macro in the presence which looks like normal digital watches because according to .
`` This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all , that it is a supervision or locating unit .
`` Or '' he notices only after certain time what gives the police a time lead he adds .
The same technology is no matter the development goes in which direction - to to bracelets or pendants , always used as in the case of the vehicle locating .
Therefore around the combination from locating function with the help of the GPS system ( just like at the Navi in the car ) and the function of a mobile telephone which reports the current position .

The chairman of the executive board of owls contest the general meeting of Vega Sicilia on application of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez , owner of the societies owls and El Enebro , does not drop .
David Álvarez , founder of the consortium , will contest the general meeting of El Enebro which will take place on application of five of his seven children on 16th , since he regards her as `` absolutely trivial '' . His children will try to get a majority to check the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the wine-growing estate Bodega Vega Sicilia .
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new justice chapter in her quarrel about control of a part of the consortium .
For enterprise services the founder of the greatest does not seem ready to be , in his lawsuit holdings to give in control of the organs of El Enebro .
He was expelled from the administrative board of five of his seven children . These appointed themselves on the shareholders ' meeting of January 18th this year which is already listed in the register of companies as contested to members of the administrative board .
The general meeting of El Enebro which was called by the judge of the commercial court Nummer 2 of Madrid for the 16th has triggered a new thunderclap in the lap of the family Álvarez .
The appeal to the judge to the setting of the meeting is the only legal way which ensures the convention of the general meeting .
The last strategy of Juan Carlos , Pablo , Emilio , Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is of David Álvarez a desperate means of the applicants - his five children - paid , around by means of legal over-subtlenesses , deceitful to let wheelings and dealings and abuse of the law appreciate the meeting declared trivial of January 18th `` , declare how official speakers as one `` .
This argumentation is the basis for the contestation of the meeting afterwards to declare her `` absolutely trivial '' .
The same protagonists who remain silent tried already without success in June to call a meeting on a judicial way .
Children sift 100 per cent of the capital at El Enebro - fortune company and owner of Bodega Vega Sicilia besides other assets - check David Álvarez ' .
The founder of the service performance group , however , demands the usufruct according to the family protocols more than 51 % of the capital .
This is the real background of the thing about that one of the judges in the hearing for the treatment of the action for the invalidation for which no date was fixed yet , to decide has .

What shall she do , the CSSD ? The Czech social democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor this one `` café '' .
The new councillors of the capital from the rows of the CSSD will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers to be able to understand her old new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and in the city representation at all .
The newspaper Aktuálne.cz has `` knocked '' members of the new council off from the CSSD a little once as they master the notorious slang which has become naturalized within the last few years in which today 's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague .
The vocabulary coded , this one of mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Praguely political elite , is it borrowed for some of the most well-known protagonists , situations and affairs in the bygone era .
Surprisingly , the new councils let themselves be seen that with respect to this one these new concepts grope in the dark a little .
They claim this at least .
`` Who is Voldemort ? ''
`` No idea . ''
`` I am rather a newcomer in Prague politics '' , Lukás Kauck ý , the new councillor for culture , reacted on the test of the `` godfather vocabulary '' .
But also the councillor Karel Brezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar manner .
For example on the concept `` putting-hole '' .
`` This is the only expression of the ones whom you present to me here which I use now and then . ''
`` I otherwise do not think much of slang . ''
From the vocabulary which the daily newspaper Aktuálne.cz had published in this year 's June before the election convention of the ODS the editorial staff picked six concepts , primarily such which is put through to the Prague municipal authorities notoriously .
The concepts `` Voldemort '' , `` greatest Prague putting-hole '' , should `` go to the café '' , `` thick neck '' , `` betrayal of the capital '' , and `` flash '' the social democrats define .
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test , the fourth - Antonín Weinerts , the future boss of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation but first , did not pick the receiver up then , however .
The fifth councillor , Petr Dolínek , declined the test from the start .
`` I do not care about these things and as the middle-class democrats talk under each other , I do not judge it . ''
He `` is important to me how we get on in the context of our programmes '' , countered .
As indicated already , Lukás Kauck ý would not have recognized allegedly in the headline mentioned above that the talk is from the influential businessman and friend of the former mayor Bém , Roman Janoušek .
The concept `` Voldemort '' says Kaucky nothing at all and the only concept which he correctly guessed at the test was `` the greatest Prague putting-hole '' .
Kauck ý says `` this is the tunnel Blanka '' , however , still added to safety reasons : `` But I rather know this from the newspaper . ''
And jocular : `` I will have to take a language course well . ''
The `` putting-hole '' then is not only decoded correctly by matador Karel Brezina but also by the councillor for enviromental issues Lukás Plach ý as a tunnel Blanka .
However , both social democrats also know for whom the concept Voldemort stands and Lukás Plach ý suspects even , where this figure be found can and also through what means it `` to go to the café '' ?
`` I think , this means to go into any Prague restaurant `` , Plach ý is rather near to this at the puzzle 's solution , if one knows that this is the seat of Janouseks companies .
Agreing with Brezina , however , he declares rather to have created this knowledge from the newspaper in that this vocabulary would be characteristic of him .
The test participants do not seem to give any slang naturalized similarly actually under the social democrats after to judge .
`` I also have asked my colleagues but obviously really does not give something like that with us . ''
We we call us at the name , use contractions or nicknames now and then , too `` `` , the chairman of the Prague CSSD says to Petr Hulínský - called `` Hulda '' by his party members sloppily .
`` I was called Bríza ( birch ) in school but I do not know , Karel Brezina betrays his nickname to us whether my colleagues also call me so `` .
The newspaper Deník Aktuálne.cz has tried out the name and see there - he works .
Councillor Weinert is friendly the `` grandpa '' or less kind of the `` altos '' for the party members , the representative Miroslav Poche who drew one 's attention to himself by wheelings and dealings at the party sponsoring before the elections is called `` Igrácek '' ( known Czech Lego figure ) by some colleagues .
Nicknames are the only thing so which in the inner-party useage the social democrats allow .
Hulínský allegedly does not like it if one mentions him `` to Hulda '' but Deník Aktuálne.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman .
His nickname `` doctor of rubber truncheon laws '' has to do allegedly with that , that Petr Hulínský has obtained his title Doctor jurist at the Bratislaver police academy .

No objections of the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not have any objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners over a Spanish national territory to Guantánamo as the U.S.A. results from a telegram of the ambassador in Madrid .
The documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily `` El País '' ( by cables ) reflect this . It is the Spanish government shall that the former acting head of the government María Teresa Fernández de demanded La Vega be informed , added , `` to prove , that foreign aeroplanes which overflies Spain are supervised adequately ``
The former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de consulted La Vega in June 2006 after the publication of a report of the Council of Europe in which financial assistance in human right disdaining practices was accused addressing with the familiar 'du'-form for countries , among this also Spain , in one .
The acting head of the government admitted , `` Zapatero has the report of the council met in the offside '' and confirmed Spain has nothing to hide in this matter .
`` La Vega underlined , De Spain does not have any objections to the secret service flights over a Spanish national territory . ''
`` You simply only would like to be informed '' to `` be not surprised without preparation '' , reports Aguirre by cables .
The former Foreign Secretary , Miguel Ángel Moratinos , also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government does not `` want to give this matter great attention although the government only has few chances to exercise one 's influence , since these would be in the hands of the judges . ''
The public prosecutor Vicente González gave for his part the embassy in January 2007 to understand that he would not the judicial initiative jam apply for the declassification of the documents of the Spanish secret service head office ( CNI ) and the Minister of Defence about the CIA flights .
`` These reports contain no charging or sensitive information '' , explained the ambassador after a conversation with the public prosecutor .
About the `` apparent coordination between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German public prosecutors '' , the USA were nevertheless more worried than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence .
`` This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts for the discreet handling '' between governments , lamented for Aguirre .
At a lunch in March 2007 in which the ambassador of the USA and the Spanish Home Secretary Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part the latter commented , that `` what they regard '' although the Spanish judges are strongly concerned about her independence and would do this incredibly as adequate , he has given his employees instructions `` to avoid puffed-uply rhetorical comments to let the tension drop ''
The ambassador also expressed his anxiety about the procedure of the PP in this matter .
`` Despite her generally pro-American attitude our experience teaches us from a note that the government Zapateros actions of the USA that the PP will not doubt , will `` , he stresses this one beat capital when possible violations of human rights could be interpreted , tolerate or have ignored deliberately even if these uncoverings could have a negative effect on the government of the USA .

Two training aeroplanes L 159 for the first time in a strange hand - in Spain
Two light fighter planes L 159 of altogether five the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged Casa C 295 m for the transport aircraft , has Seville flown to the Spanish town on Tuesday , this one , EADS settles where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa .
It is the first time that machines of this type have been into possession of a strange army .
They could be seen merely at manoeuvres or flight shows abroad till now .
It is all about the airworthy two-seater version L 159 T1 which was operated by the Czech army .
The other three aeroplanes are single-seater L 159 .
These stand one at present conserved still in the Aero Vodochody , the mediator of this business , the company Omnipol has she taken on too much last week .
When she dispatches the aeroplanes physically from Vodochody , Jan Pejšek is , not confessed according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence yet .
In turn and this without further liabilities and investments got fighter plane L 159 the single-seater on the part of the department of the ministry out of aeroplanes stored in the long run picked out .
`` The double-seater L 159 became T1 exchanged in present condition and appearances '' , told Pejšek to the newspaper Právo .
He added , the army will not have to get by without two-seater fighter planes , in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200 million contract over the reorganisation of four superfluous L 159 to the two-seater version signed since the Ministry of Defence .
A new aeroplane has taken the army in July , the second wants to take her by the end of this year .
EADS has obliged herself according to Pejšek to succeed with the fighter planes into the equipment of one of the NATO countries .
`` It is specified in the contract frankly that the enterprise EADS buyer of the aeroplanes is L 159 and that these shall serve for the education of pilots of the NATO countries .
`` It is therefore thing of the buyer how he realizes the thing '' , cited Pejšek .
The business paper ( HN ) had reported in days of yore that the Spanish government of none has the L 159 interest to .
The barter of five l 159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aeroplanes for 3.5 billion crowns still had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year .
The Ministry of Defence had not announced any tendering procedure for the purchase at that time but mentioned EADS directly .
The defence office then argued this exchange will support the future export of the L 159 abroad .
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines , of which she uses only 24 , she wanted to sell the rest .
The purchase of the aeroplanes Casa also should by the way have a legal sequel .
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence namely at the European court of justice . The reason ? It would have had to select the aeroplanes due to a whole European advertising and not at all by appealing to one single manufacturer .
The army has taken already three aeroplanes Casa , the last shall land at the airport Kbely within fourteen days .

The architects saw , a nursery school also is part of the office
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the enterprise Arch.Design .
But who would expect a mini-nursery school here already , what is included with everything : Colourful walls , creative furniture , a crowd 's toys and even a mini-playground on the outer terrace .
For last year this nursery school is at the employees ' of Arch.Design disposal .
The project planning and architectural office Arch.Design from whose studios a whole number of well-known Brno buildings is imputed of the first outlines for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for his company mini-nursery school .
Has lain that the designers and architects return as fast as possible to her job in baby boom old age and the company in a wise foresight , because most of his 90 employees are ( inside ) .
The nursery school is another bonus which Arch.Design has to offer his employees in the concept of her fair deal , shortened together with the possibility working .
The civil engineers and architects have it so more easily to bring her demanding profession and the childcare under one roof .
An original idea of the employees is ( inside ) the mini-nursery school of Arch.Design and they managed to win promoting monies of the European Union and the ministry with the support of the management for her project for work and social .
The operational mini-nursery school is financed by the operation programme humane resources and manpower policy from means of the European social fund and from the national accounts budget of the Czech Republic .
Thanks to this financing ( subsidies in the amount of 2 , 8 m. CZK ) the necessary facilities and the equipment could be obtained and for the duration of 2 years you provide qualified staff and the business .

The nursery school business is , coordinated flexibly with the need of the parents this one children of all employees have the same rights with respect to the use of the nursery school without consideration for the company hierarchy and her respective position .
Although it is individual education and care , the programme contents are nevertheless comparable with the framework of the pre-school education in the mini-nursery school .
The children do only not play here , excellent lessons primarily are commanded to them from basic knowledge up to the pre-school lessons they at the same time also learn English .
The classroom is not only with toys and creative games but also with a computer equipped which is at the children 's disposal .
The presence of little children in the company contributes what to a kind and positive company environment more .
The parents can glance at the children any time and the stress is so dropped when picking up the children with a delay from a far away nursery school .
The parents therefore use her working time more productively .
No wonder that also natural and loyal employer employee relations take shape here .
Arch.Design joined so under the Czech companies which offer at the recruiting of new employees clear Benefits who are family-orientated and confirm her staff marketing by such programmes .

450 million in contracts without advertising
Hydro Québec has allowed project planning companies 450 million dollars Eastman 1-A Sarcelle-Rupert by mutual agreement at contracts for the water-power project .
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts a syndicate stands this the most important share consisting of the companies BPR , Dessau , Groupe sm and Axor , namely that one of the project management has got , to a sum of 295 million dollars without advertising .
This syndicate 2004 as concomitant of the decision of hydro Québec , the private sector became her responsibility , this important , called `` energy gérance '' , hydroelectric project in amount of a sum of 5 billion dollars to over-answers , formed .
The syndicate `` energy gérance '' got hold of the lucrative contract at the beginning of 2005 without there having been a public advertising .
For the Parti Québécois going back to enterprise syndicates represents a grave ethical problem which brings about the risk of the competition superseding as well as a price increase .
`` This is a new way of a put-up job and weakens the competition . ''
`` This means that one carries out in open form instead of put-up job instead of in a secret way now '' , explained Sylvain Simard , representative the PQ , yesterday at the press conference .
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly because it seems to him in a way difficult to understand how , that way , the interest of the public can be used .
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to it in the afternoon by denying vehemently that this contract would have been a put-up job .
`` I remain faithful to my line '' , she cursed , she confirmed by , the PQ has been more important `` dishonestly '' and `` she lacks '' hardness .
She said it `` was the least '' that the PQ apologizes .
The model of the syndicate is worldwide common practice .
It normally is a from the point of view of time so temporary alliance which permits two or more enterprises to bundle her expertises with regard to a commandment on an advertising for a complex project .
The project `` Eastman '' shows a high complexity standard regarding his work extent .
The construction method is in way and shall be built to 2012 .
The contract nevertheless was allocated without a business struggle having been able to take place ; there had already been negotiations .
Moreover , more represents the model of the syndicate an exception in the Quebec even at relatively simple projects not at all .
As the newspaper `` Le Devoir '' made a note last week , the model of the syndicate used in the area of the civil engineer and advice nature is object of government inquiries .
A short overflight permits the Quebecer enterprise register more but to name 200 syndicates of which some of constant duration seem to be .
That way , for example the company Dessau works into partnership together with the majority of her nuclear competitors to whom SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult belong , CIMA+ , Génivar .
Any combination , and of this it gives several up , dozen explains by the very same legal entity back , namely on Dessau .
What the syndicate `` energy gérance '' concerns , has minister Normandeau emphasized so that the territory of the Baie of Jame is `` subject to a special labour dynamics and that hydro Québec gives invoice to this fact in a special way for the seventies `` .
Réal Laporte has the great employer the Société this énergie de La Baie James ( SEBJ ) given an explanation the nose about the fact has had turned up which that the contract was allowed about the project management according to agreement , ' .
`` An advertising makes and there are only few applicants , your prices will jump if you . ''
`` So you have two possibilities : You take people either , which is on this Mart and say to you : One will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price . ''
It is , however , the thought Laporte confirmed that the price is not decisive `` but the expertise of the persons `` .
This contract allowed the syndicate `` energy gérance '' is part of a long list dollar got of the Parti Québécois from contracts about more than .
The contracts were allowed to Eastman 1-A Sarcelle-Rupert by either the hydro Québec or the SEBJ for the project .
After check the branch offices , among this particularly resource laboratories , between 2002 and March more than 100 engineer and consultancy contracts , the companies counted the newspaper `` Le Devoir '' or 2010 were granted .
SNC-Lavalin had gathered 22 contracts to himself , Génivar had got 16 , Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without counting the participation in `` energy gérance '' .
All these contracts have been negotiated .
You amount completely to $ in this , included the contract with `` energy gérance '' about $ in this .
Sylvain Simard had said , that this one `` you declared yourself for Quebec well liberally `` Parti the four companies , this one form the syndicate ( BPR , Dessau , Groupe sm and Axor ) , is .
Minister Normandeau had had been touched on , the PQ is similarly connected to the companies which `` financed '' her before she specified that it rather is the executives .

Threatening gestures of the European Central Bank ( ECB . )
The investors reacted keenly on the threat of the ECB president Törichte who warned yesterday `` the markets should not underestimate our speed of reaction ''
The risk impacts of the euro periphery countries have increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks by more than 5 % .
We nevertheless should not the possibility that the ECB can be mistaken and the euro has hardly improved its performance at points underestimate what arranges to the worry .
The events of yesterday are typically of an illiquid market , this one in the measure , in which he caves in recovers again though because of the shutdown of short and highly speculative positions .
The institutional investor will not lose his fear yet for a long time .
Today a month ago the European Central Bank invited us our liquidity measures , to make the ECB must back out within two years and probably still quite a few times in the future after what tomorrow for the fourth time .
The finalisation of the plan demanded the Federal Bank for sale of national debts since these are ineffective as well as liquidity measures limited the abolition of all unusual . Only a one-week permanent access shall be kept .
After the Irland crisis we expect the present liquidity measures `` at least until March '' prolonged and the quarterly advertisings with an unlimited access on the end of the quarter to ensure of the liquidity until at least June to want to keep .
We also expect the programme for sale of bonds continual and a signal being fortifying to want to distribute .
This is , if the created expectations are not met , be the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday thrown back again and insisted if obstinate we to take our liquidity measures back , only God can help us !
Could this story recur tomorrow not take the purchase of national debts papers into consideration and the markets caved in after that just like during the ECB meeting in May during which confirmed the bank .
The ECB must be credible and insistent .
She showed her teeth in May and she , already much said on Wednesday bought to have with what she provoked a new break of the market .
The auction of one-year-old state titles was rather weak in Portugal yesterday .
The state portfolio management distributed only 500 million to 5.28 % opposite 750 million to 4.81 % in the previous auction .
Nevertheless the interest rates dropped around 30 base points in Portugal in the complete curve and funnel reflected a perception change of the markets according to the words with that .
The numbers of the fault hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland in Ireland .
The sum is valued at approximately 10 000 millions of at short notice and possible further 15 000 . There is time until February to obtain private capital or these banks are nationalized .
Although Ireland has lost his credibility completely after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July , the numbers are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty .
The government must receive the parliamentary consent to his new budget next Tuesday , though . Since she still does not have the sufficient support , Ireland is one source of the uncertainty furthermore , too .
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of the leaders and the government on December 14th . There political unity is in demand to point that these play the same score us together .
Countries are the problem , that Beethoven 's ninth symphony Germany Wagner wants to play and the other .
The Spanish district president introduced the action plan yesterday which shall be adopted by the ministerial committee on Friday .
Reform of pensions , transparency into the independent regions as in the case of the financial institutions , reduction of the government 's deficit , liberalization , privatization and job creation schemes . Measures which sound in the ears of the investors like vivaldi four seasons .
The double effect Zapatero and foolish explain twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges why the Spanish stock exchange has improved its performance by 4.5 per cent .
In comparison with February the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing and we profit from the shock effect .
There is a substantial auction of a three-year government bond which will profit from the foolish effect today . Therefore we back a heavy demand which will remove all doubts about our funding ability .
For Spain the application for a help plan would be a self-sacrifice .
We would get liquidity which we do not need . The Treasury has 40 billion euros three times as much as in March at the disposal . The interest rates are extremely expensive and the entry to the markets would be closed without notice .
Our strategy nevertheless should Caesar 's wife correspond to the motto : `` Being only not but also the appearances are counting now . ''
We create this only courage !

`` It is an independent decision of the order commission in Sonoran Desert . ''
`` Mr Espino has the right , himself in his case about the grievance procedure to the Comisión de medals del Consejo National to address , he added so that a decision is taken by a responsible place `` .
On the other hand he , it is not on the time to think of 2012 , explained and that an alliance has never sat for candidates for the presidency at the negotiating table to this one .
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción of National December 4th and 5th coming at this from the internal coordination strengthenedly at which his successor is elected would result .
`` In the year 2012 ) an alliance is not a topic which never was on the negotiating table this ( at least up till now . It was a suggestion on the local election , he was successful and fulfilled his purpose `` , he executed .
The pianistic leader therefore explained that the pan looks back at 71 years dialog `` the internal competition does not frighten us ; on the contrary `` we enjoy her and she strengthens us '' , he commented .
He said that the council needs , the or the best chairwoman , the Acción would select undisputed National for the next three years . Therefore he would submit the courier . `` at the ones whom the council would determine ''

When he is questioned over the criticism the PRI of the president Felipe Calderón because of his disk course in the context of his four-year-old government , César Nava called upon the supporters of the PRI to think about the six-year time period of the former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari .
He confirmed `` , if the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the one of Fox and Calderón , they should begin to defend her , they finally should come from the cupboard '' .
He is of the opinion that the owner of the Federal Government expressions like these , these can him make National in his discourse in the Auditorio , because there would be no mouth ban and still less one in this country censorship .

The government wants to stop the torture of `` witches '' and published a booklet
As a rule , women who are labelled as witches in Burkina Faso show some common social features .
You rather belong to the older generation , they do not find work for example for physical reasons they are single and no children have .
If one of these women `` turns '' witch , she is isolated strictly , the rest of the village can not get dangerous so that she .
`` Men are quite seldom concerned by this destiny . ''
Also young and healthy women this `` remains '' saved since they help and give birth to children at work , a nun describes the situation which takes care of more than one hundred women who were ejected by her communities in a special home in the capital of the west African country Burkina Faso .
The local government decided `` social measure '' to proceed against this abnormal one now .
And a booklet which shall stop the `` witch-hunt '' published for this reason .
However , there 's a rub in it .
`` More than 70 per cent of all adults in Burkina Faso can not read '' , the newspaper `` the standard '' pointed to the dilemma of the written enlightenment .
However , it also is to be accused of the sorcery in other African countries a matter of course .
In Ghana , the neighboring country of Burkina Faso , the 27-year Ammy Hemmahová was tormented by three women and two men to death - they poured paraffin over her and simply switched her on .
The Server BBC also reported about this occurrence among others .
The perpetrators claimed , though , the thing would have been only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances .
According to your version oil which is used for ritual unctions has caught fire .
And but after the group has tried `` to exorcize '' `` an evil spirit '' from the woman .
The people here support the isolation of `` witches '' without consideration for her education .
`` The standard '' quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso to this : `` In the past like today , eaters of human souls are a danger '' , he said .
In Burkina Faso therefore the Gambian president has at least done the government his best during himself the president been involved himself properly to defuse the witch-hunt last year .
`` President Yahya Jammeh kindled a monstrous witch-hunt after the death of his aunt since these made allegedly a contribution to the death and would try now to kill the president even by black magic also . ''
He exclaimed it `` shaman from the near Guinea to help which women and men arrested at random in the company of policemen , soldiers and the bodyguards of the president forcibly from Gambian villages carried off and in Kanilai brought about to the farm of the president `` , the organisation cited Amnesty International in her report .
The incarcerated people were forced to drink an Absud from plants with a hallucinogenic effect which , however , also caused intestines and kidney problems on the farm .
Two of the locked people did not survive the stay on the farm .
Only due to the international pressure the almost one thousand prisoners were released again .

NASA announces the find of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called a press conference to , tomorrow , introduce a find which will have effects on the search for living beings in space .
The national air and space authority ( NASA ) of the United States announces an astro-biological discovery tomorrow Thursday which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life .
The find is introduced to NASA in Washington of experts of astrobiology at a press conference in the seat tomorrow at 13.00 clock . It is this one the origin the development it a science , the distribution and the future of lives in the universe examined .
At convention of the press conference NASA assured she will introduce `` a supervision exciting find for the search for extraterrestrial life '' , what aroused speculations among experts of other countries .
The discovery could cover the theory that man-like creatures can it exist in hostile surroundings which one regarded as uninhabitable till now . The hypothesis was raised that this could change into intelligent living beings like people , if her conditions of life improved .
It apparently is a microbe , this one on the reason the mono brine was found in the Yosemite national park , California . She lives there in surroundings which were regarded as all conceivable life-forms for too poisonous , since the lake is strongly arsenic .
The microbe puts the arsenic as an over-life resource into any way . The chances increase , that under consideration of this ability there could be similar life on other planets which does not have our protective atmosphere .
If these organisms metabolise the arsenic , it is proved in accordance with astrobiologies , that `` actual another life-form , a second life-form which is different from the known one to us gives ``

Climate : As France is a smooth talker his finance promises
It is time a year according to the Copenhagen contract to examine the compliance with the financing promises ( also called `` almost start '' or premature financings ) solved fast which were carried out by the developing countries .
And the rough French whitewashings are already uncovered .
With the Copenhagen contract the developing countries have themselves obligedly to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012 .
The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years promised , France 1.26 billion euros , ( i.e . 420 million per annum ) .
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the EU has pulled all the stops to convince her partners of the fact of her engagement regarding the almost start financings : Procedure report of her member states , press conference , great side events , booklet distribution , true to detail .
The operation transparency is remarkable and degrees valued for her real value : The countries developing and the civilian company would like to see it if all developed countries made the same on the same precision standard .
The EU announces , released in 2010 2,2 billions euro to have got done what she sets on the right way to the admiration of her engagement of 7.2 billion in 2012 .
If one , however , looks into the detail , the things lie a little more complicatedly .
This money should be `` new and additional '' according to the Copenhagen contract to ensure that an additional use was brought in without doing the public foreign aid the disadvantage .
Unfortunately , there is no agreement about what `` newly and in addition '' means .
Having certain member states , among this France which blocks methods , while the EU commission had suggested a harmonization .
Everybody chooses the reference value today which he considers when at the best .
The EU commission has herself for the one of the year 2009 as a reference value chosenly , for example : The international financings will keep and `` almost start '' over three gives in the context of the financing 150 million for years to this .
Other countries have similar reference values , elected either with regard to year or regarding conditions on level of the public foreign aid .
France thought in return to it `` newly and in addition '' the financings of `` all new projects '' of the year are 2010 .
Expressed differently : There are no reference values at the versions of the year gone in front or at a global level of the public foreign aid .
Said concrete the grand total of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable ( or also decrease ) - France pretends to observe his obligation with regard to the `` new and additional '' financings .
Another , decisive element is the itemized breakdown in donations and loans .
About this there is no rule yet and everybody chooses his computing mode .
Some , such as France , are lent € 1 as equivalent with donated € 1 .
Obviously this is only heavily acceptable : The effort is not comparable .
If the use can be justified by loans for certain profitable investments ( often projects bound to the issue checking which are based on the most effective technology ) , it is deceitful to present the euro which one takes as an equivalent for a donated euro ... Moreover , only the costs of the loan for the capital owner country as engagement should be imputed , ( i.e . the equivalent of an interest rate ) .
But France has nothing according to consideration following as this one differently : It `` respects '' his obligation of 420 million euros by convince oneself of it around himself ) it 91.5 % loans ( 389,8 millions euro takes and % donates to 8.5 ) 36,1 millions euros ) , see the EU document also .
France is the only one the EU land , that loan starts in large measure .
Germany demands 46 % the Netherlands during Denmark or ( among other things ) Slovakia follow her obligations to 100 % with donations .
If the vast majority of the European Union spends € 1 for the fulfilment of her obligations , France gives 10 cents just once and understands a comparable use by it differently , said .
Beautiful hey presto !
France all in all operates in his almost start financing with a double dizziness : To a part with a further development of the action over the time and on the other hand part with the reality of financial use .
It is France successful to let think that it has distributed 420 million of `` new and additional '' millions in agreement with his promises and saves 36.1 million euros .
This one seems that it was Bercy , ( the manipulation the Treasury since it well the arbitrage has carried out ) , one could draw twice negative effect after himself ; the other member states continue once EU internal ( why , if with donating it suffices to lend anyway ) ? and then in the negotiations , since be able to not to deceive the countries developing completely ...
The chapter of the premature financings only a small question until relatively short time in comparison with the totality to discussions about the climate .
But the drop could be too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC .
We hope that this will not be the case .
Like this also , always is , it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financings .
France could primarily announce a change in his booking way for the years 2011 and 2012 and to be more precise in spirit of the respect for his obligations and the compensating justice with the other countries of the European Union .
France could primarily bring about the discussions about the matter in controversy of the long-term financings forwards , however , ( another , decisive and short-term discussed topic : ) One does not escape from the question of the `` chargeability '' or the booking type of his loans .
France could change his position to be just as progressive with regard to the points at issue how it is this at other things .
So the hope is based on the new minister of the environment Kosciusko-Morizet who will arrive in Cancun next week .
A surprising announcement over the almost start of France and his vision of the `` chargeability '' as well as the use of loans would raise the international basis of trust from nature which is necessary for secondary discussions .

The right mattress and the right bedding down grid ? Women have other wishes than men
Not the most terrific bed framework but the quality of the mattress area mattress and grid therefore agree on the good bed .
These must complete themselves harmoniously , though , to do justice to the wishes of the concrete user .
In the choice many things play a role , the weight , the size , the state of health and not least also the sex of the sleeper .
The interior in which mattress and grid have to subordinate themselves is also just as important .
Typical example ?
Latex mattresses are not suitable well in a weekend house in which you do not regularly have the heating on , since they need much longer to `` get warm '' .
Furthermore they are considerably heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses .
They should be turned regularly and .
If they do not have enough little venting channels in the core and are to this on a solid plate still namely , humidity dams himself : So it is not ruled out that mould forms under her .
In the election of course also plays a role , to what one is used .
Abroad who was for some time where very high mattresses are usual with soft stratum will a low mattress get used with a hard surface heavily on be able to .
`` All ice-hockey players which has come back from the NHL have welfare complained that they can sleep no longer correctly here to me . ''
`` They simply need a soft shift for her toiled shoulders , heels and hips from Visco foam ( memory Foam - a shape memory polymer ) . ''
`` Among other things I recommend these to also diabetic people who suffers from a disturbance of the nervous system so that they can receive the `` information '' badly from the joints and the skin '' , Sylva Hadamcziková explains which specializes in upholstered furniture .
Therefore I have already got many ice-hockey players but also other customer these mattresses with Visco foam ( memory Foam ) years ago .
`` This is no more problem today because the manufacturer Tempur , the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico offers such mattresses among others . ''
And one does not certainly have to be a famous ice-hockey player to learn to appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam .
This `` miracle '' very simply works actually .
The foam optimalises his hardness and form according to the absorbed warmth , different said , he nestles up really at the warm body .
It pushes nowhere , in the night one does not roll around like after a heavy fight .
One simply sleeps much better .
Furthermore the viscoelastic foam also offers protection from decubitus ( gangrene ) .
One still should add the length of the soles of the foot to the height in the election of the mattress size that is approx . 21 to 34 cm .
These about 180 cm are big , need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed man like woman .
At least 90 cm of couch breadth should together that is 180 cm be at each 's of the sleepers disposal .
120 to 140 cm are appropriate at single beds for example at singles .
On account of the comfort and also for possible visitors .
The following rule of thumb otherwise applies to the ideal bed breadth : `` Enough room still should , if one lies on the back , be for the arms bent easily '' , advises engineer Helena Prokopová , the guild master of the upholsterers and interior decorators who devotes herself to the difficulties of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture already for years and reports this topic also on technical colleges .
Everybody needs a grid of his own and his own mattress , however , pay attention at the purchase at a double bed , so that the mattresses are also just as high .
Nothing else otherwise is left but to put the cooking surfaces together in different height and this is not possible at every bed framework by far .
Foam mattresses at least three centimetres should be at least 14 cm highly , mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm , of this should be allotted to the form stratum and the fine cushion .
`` One may feel the feathers by no means with the hand or when putting down '' , warns Helena Prokopová .
Every mattress requires a special grid type .
Whole upholstered beds with mattress and pad like Siam twins grown together have to look for nothing in the bedroom .
These mattresses can not be let some air in and one can not wash the reference , today , what already a matter of course is .
The mattress after five to seven years and one loses , is clear there in one single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat that becomes slow to a gigantic one ( and stopped sieve up ) .
Also because of this experts decline advertising slogans , of promise up to 25 years , yes even lifelong guarantee this one at mattresses a life time .
Every thing has her ifs and buts .
And therefore a practical council of the dealers : One should not shun the hygiene of the washable , deductible income at mattresses of 120 or 140 cm of breadth , recommends himself nevertheless to use a mattress cover which one can easily remove and wash .
The manipulation often appears even if , today , mattress income is established with all around zip-fastener , as a rule , so that one gets after opening two halves ( immensely important to the washing process and the washing machine size ) ! , with bigger mattresses like the dissimilar fight between David and Goliath , executed primarily alone .
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust ?
Out so that !
Or at the most for a bed for unloved guests and for one single night .
They should provide the plate with cooling holes rather , ( provided that none already are into this ) , and use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm of minimum altitude with so-called bag inner-spring and fine cushion also so .
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a pad .
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for not adjustable gratings with 14 to 18 spring contact strips ( lamellae ) ( if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut ) , grids always pay off with a larger slat number therefore of 28 and more spring contact strips with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebrae region and the possibility , regulating the slat hardness .
No mattresses belong on adjustable lamellar grids with feather skeleton since they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment .
Besides the attitude of the stiffness of the spring contact strips also special flexible shoulder modules are demanded .
Goes around a special fastening of the spring contact strips which makes it possible to press in the spring contact strips or to wind really so that they make possible sinking in selectively for the shoulder of the sleeper .
By name for men with broad shoulders an important thing .
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area at `` sir mattresses . ''
Also the ladies are thought , one is glad for them to have these soft zones in the hip area .
Point elastic wing feather systems ( Lattoflex ) or grills are intended for most demanding customers with point elastic contact pads with a so-called multi-torsion springing .
The pressure is distributed on several points , through what the tension is reduced .
To the right one one a bad ( too great and corpulent ) pillow uses mattress and right grid , most advantages are lost again but if .
Also here a rule of thumb : The pillow shall support the head , his tops only should reach the shoulders , so that the shoulder muscles can relax .
Ideally a 50 x 60 therefore appears to cm of a big cushion , like it the Scandinavians for example like .
In the side position the pillow should compensate for the shoulder height ( together with the shoulder relief zone in the grid or the soft zone in the mattress ) .
Our modern mattresses have got with the former palliasses ( filled ) hay commonly have something anyway .
Modern manufacturers always more frequently use natural materials or at least their additions .
The new magic word `` biol '' is called also at mattresses .
Instead of mineral oil raw materials one always more frequently uses temperaments oils - for example castor-oil and soya oil for the production of polyurethane foams .
Soya is used by all well-known manufacturers well .
Biol is `` , said her core consists of materials of purely natural origin Petr Vašícek of the company Tropico explains plus this `` , at mattresses .
However , natural substances are - the first used also at the production of mattress income one aloe was Vera .
However , one also can allow himself microcapsules which spread a fresh woods or lavender smell when sleeping .
One makes a difference between man and woman also here .
While with the men one `` refrigerant '' plant extract from birch newspapers is used so that the mattress earnings can absorb the warmth and cool the body down , the income has `` warming '' effect for women .
Extracts from red peppers activate the blood circulation , so the weakerer sex gets warm when sleeping pleasantly .
And today 's favourites ?
Mattresses from cold foam he ( has bigger pores with a destroyed cell structure and therefore is more breathable than customary polyurethane and also many more flexibly ) .
Increase zone mattresses which exactly know are made from the combination of the different stiffness ( hardness ) of cold foams and Visco foams , where head , hip and heels are .
For a high-quality mattress one has to pay 7000 crowns and more , though .
However , health mattresses are charged usually by a less value added tax since they are regarded as medical aids .
As the first Czech enterprise this advantage was granted to Gumotex .
One sees , it is so easy not to economize at the mattress and at the grid .
There are special offers of manufacturers and dealers now and then who offer two mattresses at a price of one .
So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with Visco foam memory turned into desert in the purchase for 11.990 CZK .
One gets the second to it freely .
It was the material Tempur which started the era of the viscoelastic foam materials with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic tempo .
They were not developed for NASA anyway any miracle , because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the starts .
Tempur gets soft in warmth , in turn it hardens in a cool environment .
So it adapts to the human body perfectly and distributes the body printing in an optimal way .
It therefore is not only ideal for the prevention of pressure fire but increases the sleeping convenience generally .
However , viscoelastic foam materials will be supposed to provide the legs and the vessels of relief with it , not used only at mattresses but also at other health products such as at special foot cushions .
Local manufacturers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C , Twinsaver or similar products .

The Catalan cell got Al-Qaeda thousands of passports
There was three apart from the seven arrests in Barcelona further in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis arrested of the policemen of the intelligence agency of the police of Barcelona and the Nigerian formed the jihadi cell , different Al-Qaeda groups , among this the `` movement for the liberation of tamil Eelam '' ( LTTE ) and `` feeble corrie e-Taiba '' ( Let ) , steered from Thailand - the latter was an author of the assassinations in Bombay which claimed 2008 106 dead bodies - this one provided with passports .
The Spanish Home Secretary assigns a great importance to these examinations which goes so far that he insures , and `` therefore the ability to act '' with the `` operation Kampai '' the fake apparatus Al Qaidas has worldwide been `` weakened '' .
The researchers assume that thousands of passports were sent to Thailand within the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia , where these were sent forgedly and after this to the groups the criminal galaxy Al-Qaeda consists of , so that the `` fighters '' could unpunishedly exceed the limits of European and other western countries .
The uncovered cell is not , the only ones the jihadi net which was active in Europe . Therefore also other European police units have played a part in the investigations apart from the Thai fact-finding organs . It is not to rule out that it will come assassinations too similar to the EU within the next days like the one who was executed in Barcelona on last Tuesday in the field .
In coordination with this operation ( the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun , Atiqur Rehman , Jabran Asghar , Malik Iftikhar Ahmad , Mohammad Saddique Khan begum , Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerians ' Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested ) a further was carried out in Thailand , this one the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar flounder and Zeeshan Ehsan flounder as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested .
You had this one from Bangkok in Spain and a set up cell escorts for other European countries .
A part of it the Catalan net had been wrecked in the year 2009 - stole particularly tourists passports in accordance with the specifications of the so-called `` international Islamic front '' .
This means that the documents had to be issued from 25 to 45 years and to be valid for even more years on the name of men in old age ; they were not allowed to show any visa stamps .
In examination circles you underline that could up till now no arrested for unions between this one in Catalonia and be proved against the assassination in Bombay although the author of this assassination , `` feeble corrie e-Taiba '' , was do one of the receiver groups of the passports stolen in Spain and falsified in Thailand after that .
You should nevertheless remind that several thousand dollars which were `` invested '' in the purchase of Prepaid cards for mobile telephones which were used by the members of the `` command '' which an end prepared to the life of 106 persons later had been sent by Catalonia by means of a transfer of funds enterprise some days before the assassination .
The police have confiscated an extensive documentation .

He immediately invested the whole profit again in the house which he then rebuilt to the pension with 54 beds step by step .
He managed to reveal four pensions , two restaurants in original style and two hotels to entrepreneurial activity with a global capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec within only seven years since then .
The most comfortable of them was the 4-star hotel `` Pytloun design hotel '' until recently .
This year another first-class hotel joined .
`` We just have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov U Tisé , already we have sold which our franchise concept and further interested parties have themselves at the franchise of the Pytloun hotels reported '' , says the businessman Nummer one of the last year .

We always check whether it makes more sense `` have or sell ourselves and then rent back `` , he said , real estate .
Germany 's largest credit institution hands in his corporate centre again already after short time with that .
The bank had taken and then redeveloped effortfully the double towers for 272 million euros of the investors of a fund of one 's own only in the middle of 2007 .

Mysterious excavation
The atomic energy authority IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria .
However , the country defends itself , to take position as it , it still allows controls .
At least four Israeli F 15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious , cube-shaped building in Syria toward midnight from 5th until September 6th , 2007 .
It is at the bank of the Euphrat ; the next larger town , 30 kilometres removed , is Dair ace Saur .
Your name appears in documents of the international atomic energy authority ( IAEA ) if it is about the reactor alleged with the help the Syria has built in the cuboid from North Korea , hides in a valley which comes off the current .
According to a briefing of the U.S. foreign secret service CIA of the end of April 2008 this one also would have been suitable well under the name reactor familiar to the near village of tbsp Kibar to produce plutonium , nuclear weapons could be built from this .
For other purposes however technology hardly is good from the fifties .
The CIA demonstrated a business video with blurred satellite pictures .
She displayed by computer animation , where which components of the reactor have been in front of the destruction shall , the one is reduced copy of the North Korean model from the atom centre Yongbyon .
Moreover , she presented photos , the interior which shows the building from the proximity or cooked .
It was said the reactor has stood shortly before the putting into operation but still not with fuel rods equippedly been .
Today hardly more is known more than three year after the bombardment than at that time , the puzzles got rather bigger with the time .
The former U.S. president George W. Bush has revealed in his memoirs recently , it was sure that although the CIA rakes herself before the attack , however , hardly clues saw that there was `` an active nuclear weapon programme '' in the country that Syria in tbsp Kibar built a reactor .
Some secret service agents in Europe are kind even more careful there and only speak about an `` alleged reactor '' even if they keep the CIA presentation to `` plausible '' .
You lack a hard proof just like the IAEA .
Asked how he assure a high UN diplomat answered summers only succinct , the IAEA in this it was to have a reactor in front of himself enough material has `` , to guarantee around questions `` .
The Syrians misappropriated the rubble of the alleged `` unused armed forces building '' quickly and levelled the area thoroughly .
Nevertheless found an IAEA team in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in tbsp Kibar traces of uranium which had been produced by people .
Moreover , the IAEA got satellite pictures of commercial suppliers about a member state directly after the attack , from the time which might be more meaningful than the one of the CIA presented .
These photos can not be got on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - has bought her exclusively , though .
The IAEA can not verify her genuineness therefore independently .
Syria has always declared to have operated a secret nuclear programme or built a reactor never .
Damascus explained the uranium is from the Israeli weapons .
But this rejected the IAEA after analysis of the particles as improbable .
Damascus refuses to discuss it - just like about the satellite pictures since then .
Moreover , it refuses the inspectors a second inspection in tbsp Kibar and the entry to the ruins of the bombed-out building .
Israel is but also ironly silent .
`` We will never comment on it '' , the premier being in office in the time of the attack , Ehud Olmert , confirmed the official position recently .
So the examination of the case has dragged itself without result to since June 2008 and `` develops into a grave reliability problem increasingly for the authority '' as a high western diplomat grants the IAEA at the seat in Vienna , a difficult violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty finally is in the room the IAEA watches over .
As a key for progress in the enlightenment the IAEA still sees apparently another three facilities which shall be `` in a functional connection '' with the presumed reactor and different from it existing .
Neither the inspectors have disclosed till now nor which plants it is , which function they have or what she seem suspicious makes .
According to information of the Süddeutsche Zeitung they are described internally as Marj ace sultan , Masyaf and Iskandariayah , derived from near situated towns in turn , at the IAEA .
International Security in Washington ( Isis ) which it in all probability is one of the suspicious objects has identified these places and found a building complex on satellite pictures at Masyaf the independent institutes for Science and .
It possibly is in or immediately next to a military base - with these grounds Syria exactly refuses the IAEA the access to the three places .
It is said in Vienna the Syrians were afraid of a fishing expedition - that the IAEA is sent forward by the USA to //späh// armed forces plants .
Because the nuclear private investigators had got aware of the facilities by a tip of the U.S. secret services .
The IAEA has indications , among this satellite photographs , that material was transported to and fro between the three places and the cuboid at the Euphrat .
A high western diplomat in Vienna said one of the plants could at least stand `` in connection with the fuel production '' .
However , there are `` no indications of sensitive activities '' , that is uranium enrichment or reprocessing ; Processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons .
Although the reactor type is operated with uranium which is not enriched .
The uranium would have been supposed to come here and where the plutonium should be divided off for the bomb from this later , for these central questions there are if need be plausible assumptions but where .
Whether ruins which could hold valuable traces were stored at the three places is also unclear .
As if the hundreds of truck loads of the ground had disappeared , nobody wants to have information about it , where the rubble has remained .
The only few kilometres of tbsp Kibar on the other side of the Euphrat situated salt mine al-Tibni which has examined Syria 1998 for her suitability as a store for radioactive rubbish is for the IAEA as improbable .
She had the former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley brought Intelligence review to Jane in an analysis of satellite pictures for the renowned magazine with the reactor in union recently .
However , photos from the orbit show that Syria carried out excavation and removed big containers at places suspicious to three , after the IAEA had required entrance .
This can be chance , however , has hardly contributed to dispel the suspicion .
Moreover , it is called in diplomat circles , has put the IAEA into this for quite a number of months which should permit Syria , develop a plan for inspections there , to keep possible armed forces secrets , alone the effort shows how big the interest of the inspectors is .
Damascus ironed this suggestion meanwhile , too .
High urgency had the thing therefore has no western diplomats in Vienna still a year ago appeased , the reactor is destroyed , U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies has approximately taken so-called special inspections to the game , one of the toughest means which has the Viennese state nuclear authority for a couple of months to succeed with controls .
IAEA boss Yukiya Amano who must suggest these inspections already has spoken about `` an option which I am straight in the future '' , he still hesitates , however .
A high risk lies in this way : On the one hand , it needs a majority for it in the governor council of the IAEA and quite a lot of 35 represented there are countries anything but keenly on an escalation .
On the other hand , how a diplomat points out : `` What is if they find nothing at all at the end ? ''

Affaire Clotilde Reiss : The Elysée palace exaggerates his mediator function for Syria
Within more than six months of July 2009 until May 2010 the destiny of Clotilde Reiss , a young French researcher who was held tight because of `` spying '' in Iran , kept the French public in suspense , the diplomacy put on alert and accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran .
This everything under the attentive looks of the diplomats of the United States .
The American documents received from WikiLeaks and had a look by the newspaper `` Le Monde '' surrender some backgrounds of this crisis .
You describe how the Elysée had explained his strategy to the Americans who on the whole went to give these advice to dealing with her own crisis of `` takings of hostages '' in Iran ( a small group of hikers ) .
Showing you as the French responsible parties have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman does not have the release of Iranian held prisoner in France by Majid Kakavand , one and looked for due to trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme by the American justice for the service in return .
Finally they put the way with which the French committee has tried manipulate the media to an end to make these the idea credible , the Syrian president Bachar Al Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss in a glaring light .
He had done nothing in this regard in truth .
A diplomat telegram edited on August 12th , 2009 in Paris bears the title Iran `` : French commentaries on the way of dealing with takings of hostages `` .
François Richter , Elysée adviser in strategy questions , talked the quay this in the company of Patrice Paoli , director ' Orsay for North Africa and the middle Orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone .
You explained the French method to her .
These advised the Americans to risk everything to lead her own nationals who would forcibly be held tight in Iran back .
They said `` noise makes '' , `` the word `` basic human rights '' , `` innocence '' , `` immediate release '' in the media , articulates loudly and considerably and without refrain `` .
This is at a loss necessarily , around the Iranian regime to take , which very severely pays attention to his image .
`` All the more this operates , do not do this particularly since the Iranians ask you `` .
Ways , the Iranians are because `` silence solves nothing '' , past `` masters in evasive actions '' the discussion tests about on unobtrusive .
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is `` common , Iranian tactics '' : `` Taking of hostages to an end of political extortion '' .
He is , heralded `` the payment of a large sum of money asks ( 230,000 euro bail of Clotilde Reiss from prison ( which should take place on August 16th on the day on which she flees to the French embassy ) to the Iranians '' the release ) .
And he lets announce , the Elysée anticipates further takings of hostages , a phenomenon which `` will intensify '' .
The Iranians could `` in the near future unite the approximately 1,800 arrest a French citizen , live this one in Iran `` , others he said so .
August 28th , 2009 .
Clotilde Reiss has been discharged from prison twelve days ago , is held tight in Iran , however , furthermore .
Some information was taken to circulation : The Iranian Majid Kakavand whose delivery the united states demand due to an illegal trade with delicate electronic material to Iran has been dismissed from the custody after decision of a judge in Paris .
The American embassy faces , like numerous other observers , questions about this worrying coincidence .
For Washington which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of this for the nuclear programme scheduled material the release of Majid Khakavand represents a piece of bad news .
Has France accepted a horse-trading ?
The liberation of the Iranian against the one of the Frenchwoman ?
On the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4th François Richier assures that this is not the case .
The Elysée , not he says so , was only `` surprised '' by the decision of the judge completely but also has tried to rebel against it .
( At present Michèle Alliot-Marie ) `` has given an active exchange between the French committee and the French Lord Chancellor '' but he explains `` the French government can not change the judicial decision '' .
Mr Richier also would like to point out that furthermore Majid Kakavand stands under `` strict '' supervision of the French secret service .
Informs the American diplomat thereupon the Elysée adviser chooses a phone number , establishes again , the Iranian `` would be in the buildings escorted by the Iranian embassy in Paris at present '' .
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran and `` influential mediator role '' the Elysée does not spare his efforts , by means of announcements and `` escape attempts organized by the media '' thinks to make , the Syrian president Bachar Al Assad plays one `` important '' .
The Americans do not watch this activity without irony and notice that the manipulation carries fruits , since several press articles reflect the official French version .
A telegram dating of August 25th , 2009 brings about `` the medium lightning of the French authorities '' .
The Parisian message asks herself what bases so much `` intimation of gratitude '' opposite Mr Assad on .
`` Despite her explanations full of praise the French authorities admit secretly that they have only a vague idea about it what the syrians have actually done '' .
The document deals thereupon , with the reasons these have to become a slave to this fiction taken the Elysée .
The intensive communication efforts are `` as of , aimed he analyses to confirm Sarkozys policy of the opening opposite Syria `` .
A 2008 launched politics which `` was perceived in France as well as abroad by numerous critic voices as premature and undeserved '' at that time .
`` Blowing the Syrian role out `` Paris tries '' to make clear to Syria which commendation one can obtain , by one playing a constructive role in the region `` .
In addition , it is aim `` to sow discord between Syria and Iran '' .
The American embassy knows this from a reliable source .
You had entrusted François Richier on August 11th : `` we of course do not know whether the syrians have always done what , too '' .
`` But we have thanked them despite everything . ''
`` This should at least cause confusion with the Iranians '' .
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16th , 2010 .
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Elysée .
He thanks the presidents of Brazil , the Senegal and Syria for her `` active role in favour of the release of our compatriot '' in a communiqué .

Supply offensive for the hunting for customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar drops an avalanche this year .
The celebrations paid by employees spread . You do not want to issue any more than 20 to 30 euros .
How the Turrón and the christmas draw gives it again in the pre-christmas period to group dinners which supply the restaurants and leisure trade with Barcelona 's oxygen , too . But because of the economic crisis they trigger a price offensive to also capture the customer segment which represents the big mass : Everyone almost would like between 20 and 30 euros for one noon or confirms dinners distribute the questioned businessmen and associations .
The accounting gets even a bit more complicated , the calendar ( New Year 's Eves fells ) for a Friday has dropped all orders in the week from December 13th with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinners on two top days ( the 16. and 17 . ) and hardly any so that orders in the week before that .
Having when the bad times started many enterprises stopped the group dinners since 2008 for household reasons .
To not have to abstain from this tradition , many employees pay these from her own bag .
As the economic situation also always lies , lowest prices are asked does the chairman of the restaurant committee confirm of Barcelona , Gaietà Farràs ?
Up till now the representative of the holding organization does not venture to predict how the holidays this month will look .
`` People think it over ' umpteen time , before they reserve . ''
He emphasizes `` you would like to go out but respect her strongly on the prices '' .
The business will turn out all right these , `` the quality at good prices with a good service offers '' , he adds and calls us in the memory that the customers economize in times of crisis , why prices are asked for by 25 euros most strongly .
At a survey in various centrally situated restaurants it turns out that the evening of December 17th leads the suppliers to the collapse .
The group of Soteras says the demands would less but to spend 30 euros boom with the intention for this Friday . The group has adapted her menus to the economic situation with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros .
With another leading group , Andilana , the 16 restaurants in the town ( Hostal de La Rita , market , La Fonda and others ) maintains , the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations even as of the beginning of November .
He explains `` we have made the impossible possible to maintain last year 's prices with menus for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euros '' .
To Grup , the tbsp of mush sol , Attic , QuQu and altogether 23 restaurants conducts , does not lose the optimism one at , since the second quarter the takings flourish again and good if you await also on prospects of the Christmas trade concentrated few days after .
Sources of the consortium stress that the 18th also will be a hyperactive day with friend groups , the Christmas early celebrations .
A Christmas menu was added to the six group menus for 30 euros or more than price hit . One has the impression that the customers are ready to distribute 10 per cent more than in the previous year and in return more wish details such as Cava .
One sees green rungs also in some companies sprouting why the employees are invited again . This conveys the impression that the group meals are again in the upswing .
The acting chairman , Enric Gomà , seeing the end of the tunnel on this familiarly and remark on the part of the holding organization Fecasarm with associations like the pubs , restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona that the reservations altogether are quite `` lively '' although the customers `` hammer out a maximum '' .
The fun with celebrating has not declined no matter who pays , though .

Obama stops new oil drillings
There will not be any new oil drillings within the next years off the coast of the U.S. federal state Florida in the golf of Mexico .
A corresponding ban has passed the government in Washington , and revoked her earlier plans definitely with that .
Also in front of the eastern seaboard new drillings remain forbidden for the time being .
This informed Home Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday .
Trigger for the strict ban which shall be at least valid for the next five years is the explosion of the drilling rig `` Deepwater Horizon '' in April .
This the life cost and led to the greatest ecological disaster of the USA , president Barack Obama had signalled his readiness on pressure of the opposition and the industry to allow new drillings in the eastern part of the golf of Mexico before the accident , eleven workers .
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the USA of oil supplies from abroad with that .
To this day , who takes the responsibility for the devastating oil pollution in the golf is not cleared in conclusion .
The British energy group BP which is confronted with billion demands is in the centre of the criticism .
An investigating committee on behalf of Obama shall present her results in the course of December .
Home Secretary Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion in October .
Different oil companies had immediately made applications for new drilling plans in the connection .
With sharper controls and more severe safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent catastrophe .
At present , the responsible control authority which had got after numerous corruption reproaches in disrepute is reformed basically .
In parallel , Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas groups .
The industry warns publicly now that the capacity in the golf would turn out considerably lower than till now by a stricter regulation .
`` The plans of the government '' are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry , the result of a current industry-specific survey is by the adviser company BDO still with the drilling ban on Wednesday .
Moreover , the American Energy Alliance laments the uncertainty in the line of business : `` Nobody knows what will change with the regulation exactly . ''
Investments into new sponsorship schemes would be put off at the expense of the growth for the time being .

The secret complex shaken Canada let some air in
The new , American diplomat lines which were spread by WikiLeaks reveal the secret about what the united nations consider under the inferiority complex of the Canadians opposite the Americans ; however , they put the superiority complex Canada with the same blow opposite the last-named open .
The American diplomats consequently are astonished about it that the visit of president Obama would that according to have the Canadian elector at the ballot not the Canadian American relation has and they think helped the conservative government to succeed with her budget of 2009 !
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington which were spread publicly yesterday still offer more piquant details than the mere material contents at which one has to nibble .
A connection dating of September 22nd , 2008 not participating as of which point the united nations , report , any more , i.e . in the time period in which the federal election campaign was situated in the full gear in uses discussed by her political bosses .
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins , the ambassador who is employed in Ottawa and American .
Mr Wilkins offers different explanation possibilities of this situation .
`` An inferiority complex almost being inherent in the Canadians conditionally possibly much rather induces the Canadian , political executives to speak about inner points at issue of the weekday but push black Peter over to the United States in this election ( as 1988 at the campaign about the free trade ) '' , he describes so .
He concludes , so the united nation therefore is `` proverbial Goliath this election : Omnipresent but too dangerous potentially to speak about him `` .
All the less the ambassador understands this `` deafening silence '' since the two countries cherish intensive political and economic relations .
`` He judges , logically `` , `` so it should be the ability of a candidate , a party and still much more of a party leader for leading a such essential relation , according to that one of the electors at the going to the polls as a key factor has . ''
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads himself in the communication sent on January 22nd , 2009 of Terry Breese , representative in Ottawa , which president Barack Obama shall prepare on his first visit in Ottawa .
`` Your journey will help to ensure the government continuing to exist by the vote of confidence about the federal budget at the beginning of February at which his first deficit after more than a decade which has arisen due to a revival programme in the height of 30 to 40 billion dollar will announce Canada '' , Breese describes .
Nowhere he had the continuing to exist of the opposition parties so conditionally would have an effect on the quality of the suggested revival programme mentioned that the sitting of parliament before Christmas had the government had to adjourn around to prevent , that the parliament would be brought down by the coalition and himself .
Notification which is another , dating of January 2008 and written on the part of the ambassador Wilkins contacts Washington of the picture getting more and more negative that the series which are broadcast about CBC and dramatic of the United States spread .
The ambassador is in which worried one little subtle allusions to Maher Arar over shipments like Border , Little Mosque on of The Prairie , Intelligence and H2O , CIA of examinations carried out can watch the the `` no Fly cunning '' or also payments to an end of by musclemen .

Public prosecutor will not accuse senator Ensign
Public prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted senator John Ensign of the accusations , these to his Affaire with a former election campaign helper and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobbying of members of parliament were lifted up against him , announced the advocates of the senator on Wednesday .
This decision concludes the most difficult on the right reproach against senator Ensign , the republican from Nevada . Which nationwidely headlines provided and a silencer gave to his career , he was regarded as a possible candidate for the presidency of the republicans for 2012 until the scandal .
As senator Ensigns announced office , he was `` highly pleased '' with the verdict after the one-year examination .
The ethic committee of the senate still could , however , impose a punishment .
According to statement of Ensigns advocates they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the examinations were stopped against senator Ensign and that in this matter no further charges are available .
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case .
The verdict was a surprise for many ethic advocates outside the Ministry of Justice . In your opinion there was an adequate proof that Ensign has disregarded the lobbying ban .
Interviews , e-mails and other documents which was disclosed in the New York Times for the first time in October 2009 , admitted reason for the assumption that helped Ensign Douglas Hampton , one of his polling officers , to get lucrative orders to pay for his silence about an Affaire with Hampton 's wife Cynthia .
Cynthia Hampton was workingly as treasurer Ensigns during an election campaign .
Ensign made contact to some political friends to provide Hampton with work . According to the documents and interrogations he took on lobby work for her after Hampton 's employment .
Since Hampton recently still was in Ensigns election team was he was not allowed to take on lobby work for his former employer or the entire senate for one year .
According to the statement of ethic experts the unusual agreement violated between Ensign and Hampton who were close against the so-called ban on the revolving door lobbycracy in front of the Affaire .
In accordance with the published circumstantial evidence `` it is an arrangement and the violation of the revolving door statutes by all appearance '' , so Stanley Brand , a Washington advocate which has specialized in the defence of clients who are in the visor of the government .
The reasons for the decision in the Ensign case public prosecutor which was pursued by the media with great interest , told Mr . Brand and other ethic advocates the ministry seemed very carefully in taking political charges after a variety of defeats , including the decision last year announce Stevens because of misconduct the fall while the Ministry of Justice said no officially , the charges against the former senator Ted , on the part of to drop .
Melanie Sloan , the chairwoman of the union , told obviously public prosecutors are `` easily startled '' ( to `` Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington '' an organisation , her aim the fighting corruption is the USA in parliament and governmental circles this one ) , a group of lawyers which has brought different charges against Mr. Ensign ahead of court .
`` In principle , this means that government officials of high standing can assume now , she added that the laws do not apply to her `` .
Paul Coggins , leader for the defence of Mr. Ensign , said in an interview he had a telephone call of a public prosecutor got and another day next the on Monday in which that the ministry will not take any proceedings against his client was informed about him .
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the public prosecutors to convince her that the senator has `` sold the law in agreement '' as his office repeated in an explanation on Wednesday once more .
Mr. Coggins declined to explain the legal arguments more exactly which he had put forward opposite the public prosecutors .
`` I am not into the bargain well to go into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me . Only so much is said : We think to have taken the right decision `` , he said .
The federal electoral commission has decided to stop the inquiries because of a separate complaint last month by the ethic group after which the Hampton has expelled a payment of $ 96,000 from Mr. Ensigns parents against the federal electoral act .
The electoral commission said there has not been enough proof that something else than a present has been the money .
The long time supported the senator , NV Energy , a large company in Nevada , one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign was .
An e-mail from December 2008 covered , that , when lobbyist has advanced , Mr. Ensings chief of staff , John Lopez , a discussion had with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he `` knocks '' for the Home Office because of a thing after the company Mr. Hampton .
Mr. Ensign in addition had an appointment with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada , Allegiant Air , for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to agree on a meeting in the name of the airline company , after Hampton had taken on this Mr. for the purpose of lobby work .
When information about this affair penetrated into the public last year for the first time , Mr. Ensign excuses himself with his electors and his position gave up in the senate , where he had been at fourth place in the ranking of the republicans .
After he had not stood out many months any more Mr. Ensign told reporters , two weeks ago which strives in the senate for a third period of office stories .
His press agent , Jennifer Cooper who hopes for senator , explained that the ethic commission follows the example of the Ministry of Justice and very fast stops his inquiries in the announcement , that Mr. Ensign no more be the aim of police investigations .
`` Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada '' , she said .

On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high person responsible for the anti terrorism fight prevention of new uncoverings .
Interpol distributes a red warning for the following and discovery from Assange .
Everything which is connected with Wikileaks and whose founder , Julian Assange , forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can be cleared up only difficult .
Interpol distributed a `` red warning '' for the `` discovery and following '' of Assange yesterday .
This is not a traditional order for the arrest , though .
In addition , she is not new , she is of November 20th .
Nothing also has to do with the last uncovering of over four millions diplomatic documents from the USA but you must face those of the Australians in Sweden with the accusations of a sexual abuse .
Furthermore the advocate of the founder of Wikileaks , Mark Stephens , insures `` the police would know , where and how she can make contact with Mr Assange . ''
The international police authorities distributed the order with seat in Lyon ( France ) on application of Sweden already on 20th but she was not announced until yesterday upon receipt of the authority by the Swedish authorities .
So the things lie . The 188 interpol countries are instructed to identify and to find Assange `` to arrest and deliver him for the time being ''
Although interpol can not order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning many member countries regard the red warning as royal charter after saying the organisation for an arrest - this one must particularly be carried out by the national police , if they dispose how it the case of Sweden and England is of a bilateral delivery agreement , where Assange stays presumably .
Assanges Anwälte filled with indignation proceeding , the gestures published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference .
You also remind that Assange applied for the departure from Sweden and the corresponding one received approval from the public prosecutor who is compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria , chief safety officer of Stalin .
`` This is like a hunting , not like a legal following '' , is accused in the letter .
While the world is looking for him , and his mother declares the innocence of her son from Australia , Assange holds on to an unknown place open , being not silent , though .
On Monday he entered the head of the magazine time an interview by Skype from an uncertain place . He applied to the conversation for the resignation of the permanent secretary of the USA , Hillary Clinton .
Can that she was responsible spy diplomats , UNO out more North American for the order and has violated international agreements signed by the USA with that `` if be proved `` , he said do she must step down .
His opinion was sentenced yesterday by the press secretary of the White House , Robert Gibbs , who described the application for resignation as `` ridiculous and absurd '' .
He explained `` I am not sure why we should attach importance to the opinion of a type with a web site '' to the transmitter CNN .
Obama himself has engaged a high person responsible for the anti terrorism fight , Russell inhabitant of Trave , to do the prevention of new document uncoverings .
The attempt of the spokesman of the president Barack Obama to give Assange less attention conflicts with the opinions which announce conservative politicians and commentators within these days .
The state department has asked the congressional representative Peter King who will lead the chairmanship in the national safety committee of the parliament as of January to examine the possibility of setting Wikileaks organisations on the list more terroristly `` to confiscate around the monies and everybody , which supports her or makes a contribution to pursue ``
His statement Tom Flanagan , adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper , had gone still further and he must , Assange must `` be murdered '' revoked .
`` Obama should convert him to a target and use a not manned aeroplane or something like that . ''
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee , baptist minister , former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency .
Who it always was , too , this one let information leak out in the government and everything is `` what no execution is , a too mild punishment is `` , he guiltily of the betrayal he explained Fox to the transmitter .

Inspectors in the twilight
The European food and drug administration Efsa is infiltrated by the industry experimenting with gene plants .
The group of experts Testbiotech which sees herself as an independent institute for the subsequent estimate of the biotechnology is formulating this reproach now .
`` It sounds like a conspiratorial theory but we have documented it well '' , said Testbiotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich .
The head of the Efsa group of experts for plants , Harry Kuiper , changed genetically and another Efsa expert are Ilsi also at the lobbyist association under contract for years .
This one is paid by groups like Monsanto , Nestle or Bayer .
Kuiper has collaborated in the Efsa test specifications for gene plants substantially and is in a clear conflict of interest with that , criticized for Then .
The Efsa regulations are in paragraphs identical in word with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive the handwriting of the industry with that which shall be checked by the authority actually in the Italian Parma .
It already is the second time that Testbiotech finds fault with an inter meal collision .
So a high-profile Efsa manager is Syngenta without editions or transition period to the Swiss agrarian group recently , and has changed the sides with that .
Also recently had personnel connections between checking EU authority and industry lobby reveals , what the department of the environment just like EU parliamentarian has made poorly soundproofed for Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk ( MDR ) .
The Efsa can not recognize any conflict of interest meanwhile .
One goes back back , also open such to all serious data it is called the industry in a statement as long as they are of high technical quality .
One does not ask of the experts who work for Efsa that they do not have any contacts to the industry .
However , you should disclose these .
Kuiper grants his work to institute ( Ilsi ) in the USA for the International Life Sciences .
This describes itself even as a neutral forum for experts from science , industry and politics - among other things to the calculation of risk for biotechnology without lobby order .
Independent experts like Then criticize in the thing that plants changed genetically are allowed without every feeding test with animals at present and the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested .
`` We want to know what maize changed for example genetically does on the field '' , says Then .
It is a present practice to test isolated proteins but not the whole gene plant merely which does not provide any reliable results .
`` If one does not seek the risks , how shall one then find her ? `` , Then asks accusingly .
This also sees Angelika Hilbeck so .
The scientist searches in the genetic engineering since 1994 and is at present active at the technical university Zurich .
The industry tries to influence or to discredit scientists in this field like in the USA in Europe always more , critical now , too .
There therefore are hardly any researchers who are not interwoven with groups .
As a rule , critical studies would not be published for enterprises .
`` The industry checks the safety research '' , claims Hilbeck .

The army has so many fuses that could one wrap round whole Czechia think you , however , for only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of fuses , explosive devices are detonated .
Before , the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps in the year .
It is already calming down to know that the defense forces have from worried for 225 years .
The problem is - only the durability of the fuses two , at the most but four years .
The army bought the fuses of the public limited company STV Group , a. p. for silly 40 million crowns .
In his grounds for the purchase of this enormous lot of fuse the general staff answered MF DNES the soldiers would use up about 60 kilometres of fuse every year .
Which asked MF DNES about it , goes out from this detail from all generals and officers of the army command up to the secretaries and cleaning ladies that the whole army must complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic education annually according to the enquiries of army pyrotechnists .
Not excepted for Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek .
The considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses could be justified partly only in such a way .
This length corresponds by the way to 25.000 explosions .
This army inventory would suffice for more than ten year but also so .
If the old rule of experts is , however , still valid that two metres of fuse suffice for the training of every new professional soldier completely , then the army has herself for created the 225 years already mentioned by these new purchases - stock calming one also under the point of view of the increased need of the sapper and special squads .
Soldiers of the fast use brigade complained to the Minister of Defence Vondra recently , they would have almost no more cartridges for handguns so that shooting practices are limited strongly because of the missing means .
Completely being silent of the pant defect .
`` Why I not understand , she of us buy such vast amounts fuses either ? ''
But this is her decision at long last , they already will know what they need her for . ''
For us the army is `` , the we as dealers extensive contrary to liked to come `` , a good customer the sales manager says to STV Group Jan Decký .
Spokesman of the Ministry of Defence accounts with that for the purchase one hundred kilometre fuse Jan Pejšek , this one , this one army would have stocked up on this `` ammunition '' so at least for ten years .
Jan Decký of STV Group only speaks , however , about a four-year time of use of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnist really only of two years .
Storage is well possibly `` at perfect `` , also the four mentioned years one of them which , however , wants to remain unnamed to be not accused of the criticism of the army as a soldier fills .
After expiry of the time of use must any ammunition be tested thoroughly , whether she is still reliable and does this not endanger lives of the soldiers ?
These tests , however , are legitimately but cost further money .
Further argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of fuse .
`` You cost us sixty per cent less as the last year 's delivery of 244 kilometres '' , speaker Pejšek informs us about the point of view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence .
Only for comparison purposes : The annual consumption of fuses of pyrotechnists of the police which liquidate ammunition from the second World War or the Soviet brother army exceeds hardly any 1.500 metre already for some years .
And the police always order only such amounts of this ammunition which still can consume her before expiry of the time of use .
Spare because of the safety of the pyrotechnists , in addition , one keeps the possibility for flexible purchases of more modern and therefore also reliable fuses open so .
The Ministry of Defence has anyway gigantic problems at the liquidation ten thousand tons ammunition from times of the Warsaw contract when the Czechoslovakian People 's Army of two hundred thousand prepared for her campaign to the Rhine .
Which mentioned MF DNES according to the pyrotechnists , the same problem at the liquidation of one hundred kilometre old fuses which she has bought so `` favourably '' today expects the Czech defense forces within a couple of years .

Thousands mourn for dead mates
More than 10.000 people have commemorated the miners buried alive in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine .
The corpses still could not be recovered because the security situation is further precarious in the accident shaft .
Almost two weeks ago it had come to an intense explosion near the city of Greymouth into the pike 's River mine .
29 miners at the age between 17 and 62 years were buried alive below day .
A probe had been drained to to the accident shaft , however , had not discovered any trace of survivors .
Due to the high concentration of poisonous gasses and further following explosions no rescue workers to dosshouses could for safety reasons .
After the second intense explosion the authorities and experts had assumed that there is no more chance of survival for the mates .
Till now , the corpses could not be recovered .
Members and friends reminded of the dead bodies with a commemoration now .
Ten thousand people had assembled at a radiant sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand south island .
They were silent for two minutes .
In honor of the miners buried alive , 29 tables were built , were to see helmets , lamps and the names of the mates on which .
Also pictures and personal objects , among this garments and surf boards , found her place here .
The flags blew on at half-mast in front of the government buildings of the country .
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come to the surface `` from the depths of the earth '' again , the New Zealand prime minister John Key said to the participants of the commemoration .
`` But they have never come home . ''
He could not complete with the death of his son as long as he has not seen the corpse , Lawrie Drew said , the son Zen Buddhism was buried alive in the pit .
Several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration next to the prime minister and member of the victims .
At the first explosion on November 19th miners of British and South African origin also had been buried alive .
Rescue workers started to put a fire out inside the coal mine on the south island of New Zealand .
It was begun with that as soon as the explosive gasses are displaced to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine , chief constable Gary Knowles said to journalists .

The democratic routine
The democracy movement in Latin America gets stronger like the support of private enterprises .
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment .
The influence of Brazil is greater than that one of the United States in many parts of the region .
The Latinobarómetro survey which was carried out in 18 countries and published in The Economist exclusively arrived at these conclusions .
This survey is regularly carried out since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region so .
Two facts fall eye particularly into it in this year 's survey of the September and October .
Firstly the good atmosphere in Latin America
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and her most important institutions .
( P. table 1 ) has gained in the democratic movement strongly in numerous countries at the South American pacific coast .
E.g . where the economy grows by approx . 6 % since 2002 every year the number of the democracy supporters increased from 40 % in the year 2005 to 61 % this year in Peru .
Such a trend can be recognized also in Mexico where the economy recovers since the strong drop last year again .
The half of the people asked is convinced democrats in Mexico and Brazil , the population richest countries of the region , what lowers the regional average ( p. diagram 2 ) only ?
Approx . 44 % of the people asked explained that she be satisfied with the democratic practice of her country . These are so many like last year , however 25 % more than in the year 2001 ( diagram 3 ) .
About 34 % trust the convention of her country and 45 % of her government . Both values correspond to those of the last year , however , 2003 ( 17 % or 24 % show a clear increase opposite ) .
A decade ago Latin America 's economic crises undermined the efforts around more democracy .
Also this during the world economic crisis lasted , is due to it possibly that the countries of Latin America this experienced only a short one recession phase and have recovered fast again .
Furthermore the poor were caught by a stronger social net .
( According to the reports of the UN economic committee for Lateinamerika of this week the poverty instalment rose only insignificantly in Latin America in 2009 and has fallen by 32 % this year again . )
But there are strong atmosphere differences ( p. diagram 4 ) of country to country .
Silva is reflected for presidents Luiz Inácio Lula Brazil 's strong economy and the popularity the dividing in a common progress intellect there .
The case is this few in Mexico and Central America where the recession more strongly was noticeable and crimes of violence have increased .
Only for the second time since the survey beginning , in the crime , in Latin America , in her country , many people asked see a greater problem than in unemployment ( p. diagram 5 ) .
Either she herself or a member of the family last year victims of a crime became say approx . 31 % , that . But opposite 38 % last year the values have dropped and therefore reach the lowest level since 1995 .
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and the market economy : Approx . 71 % of the people asked supraregionally said that the private industry is indispensable for the development , in the year 2007 it was 56 % ( p. diagram 6 ) .
Approx . 58 % explained that only the market economy can bring her country progress , compared with 47 % last year .
62 % of the people asked have interestingly enough kept this view in Venezuela ( and are 80 % for a private industry ) although her left president , Hugo Chávez , nationalizes many private enterprises .
The greatest has 19 % of the people asked ( 18 % last year ) Brazil loudly weight in the region , followed by the United States ( 9 % , unchanged since last year ) and Venezuela ( 9 % compared with 11 % last year ) .
The people asked in Mexico and most countries of Central America , however , see in the USA the most influential country , in which this role is taken on by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua .

The government Berlusconi goes into cover in Italy
After a beginning of the week worrying for Italy the situation has relaxed a little with the fall in the bank savings rates yesterday for 10 years .
A return to the deceitful silence .
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Trade and Commerce had the region chairmen Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation when `` indecipherable '' and him have heard calculating with an `` unpredictable '' weekend which the in question , however , immediately denied .
Anyway the scissors would have achieved his record with the German interest rates of 210 base points and the prices of the contracts for the cover of the danger of bankruptcy are on 263 points risen , what a certain panickiness had caused in Rome on Tuesday .
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his ministerial committee that the discrepancy of Spain amounts to 400 base points at the German interest rates .
His right hand , Gianni Letta , had spoken from direction Ireland of the `` market turbulences '' and a possible risk of infection , however , when `` got heavily '' .
`` The good news is that Italy , the third national economy of the euro zone , not as Greece or Ireland is . ''
It `` is the bad news that Italy like Portugal is '' , explains Irwin Stelzer , economist at the Hudson institute .
This in plain language means his problem is being able to cover the absence of economic growth and the control inputs which are accompanying with that and consumptive which take the state to danger his financial requirement no more .
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government .
In future , an Italian growth is expected from 1.1 % in 2011 and from 1.4 % in 2012 ... although the household budget being at the senate for the examination expects 1.3 % or 2 % .
The EU commission calculates so , and 3.5 % in 2012 ( instead of 2.7 % the budget deficit will make up 4.3 % of the GDP next year certainly ( contrary to the one of the governments ' predicted 3.9 % ) under these prerequisites ) .
Therefore also the riot around a new household collective which could be used for a sum of 7 billion euros after the holidays .
`` If necessary new economy measures must be taken up '' , thinks accountant Olli Rehn .
At the hour Italy gets the support of international institutions .
`` Are OK the foundation of Italy 's economy and his accounts are regulated , we repeat this already for long time '' , insured for Arrigo Sadun , Italian trustee of the international monetary fund which is entrusted with Italy at the IMF .
`` It does not give up any problems , neither on neither short-term nor on a long-term sight at the moment , lower stabilization progress is there of Italy despite his high indebtedness ( 119,2 % of the GDP in 2011 , A. d. R. ) `` , demanded pier watches Carlo Padoan , chief economist of the OECD , than of other countries .
The question about the political discontinuity remains .
On December 14th Silvio Berlusconi is , because of which himself a motion of 'no confidence ' of the representative chamber against overlooked this one elections could already preferred be organized at the end of March .
So it a little convenient period stands for a decision making before with regard to a serious crisis .

A longer forefinger than ring finger means a lower risk of falling ill with cancer
Longer , men are the forefinger , as the ring finger , obviously a lower risk is exposed to falling ill with prostate gland cancer .
This is the surprising result of a study which was published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday .
This shall be connected with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone namely .
The co-author of the study , rose eles , declared lady professor at the cancer research institute at university in Warwick `` show our results , that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate gland cancer and this by name with men to sixty `` .
The finger could help to determine which men should certainly take a prostate gland cancer test primarily so , genetic risks or other risk factors are available such as family physical loads if Mrs Eeles added .
She followed more than 1500 patients with prostate gland cancer , at the same time 3000 healthy men with her colleagues in Britannia in the period of 1994-2009 , however , too .
The forefinger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger at more than the half of the participants of the study .
The same probability of prostate gland cancer whose ring and forefinger were equally long like for 19 per cent of the men applied to these men .
With men whose forefinger was longer than the ring finger this risk sank , however , by 33 per cent with men to sixty even by 87 per cent .
Obviously the relationship of the length of the both mentioned fingers which form already in the prenatal age reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus .
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer forefinger .
Earlier researches showed that definitely the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate gland cancer .
Leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the academy of sciences , this study is , CTK said , briefly known to him , till now , Václav Paces , he nevertheless does not keep the relationship for `` proved completely '' between the finger length and the risk of cancer .

Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has himself for the keep conditions for the entire European Union built the euros decidedly but at the same time .
The tensions on the markets have aroused a double answer of the government .
On the one hand has presented new adjustment measures to José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , these do not buy unemployment benefit begun at tax reductions for Klein and small enterprise , the regulation of temporary work enterprises or the abolition of the 426 euros support for unemployed up to the privatization of 49 per cent of AENA , the administration of airports Barajas and El Prat as well as 30 per cent of the state lottery .
On the other hand the acting head of the government , Elena Salgado , supports Felipe González with the help of the former district president , which brings about the present crisis the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible parties has .
How do these events have to be understood ?
It is , anticipated this Merkel 's position is not a fault of her public relations .
On the contrary , it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro .
Germany takes a basically new perspective for the design of our future which collides with the retention of the traditional traditions of a large part of his partners .
In view of the resistances in Europe one starts with over three possible solutions for the crisis to speculate in Germany .
The first one : A strong euro with Germany , Austria , the Netherlands and other countries during the south must leave the euro zone .
The second : The reintroduction of the German Deutschmark supports - although this at present rather sounds like science fiction - , of a large part of the public opinion , approx . 50 per cent of the population .
The third party : A redesign of the euro in accordance with German suggestions . This means : moremacroeconomic control ; absolute housekeeping ; Punishment of the countries which break the specifications ; possibly the stoppage of payments of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector .
The German position is clear and stands out already for some time . Therefore there are no excuses now .
A constitutional reform pulled himself out of the sleeve to prevent this as of 2016 , when first 2009 the IMF and the European Commission made incentives for deficits both and the German government .
This was the first symptom for it and the methods of his European partners including France diverge between this , what Germany considered necessary ( severe tax plans and stable public finances ) .
The second sign put the Central European country when Merkel postponed the decision painfully to the rescue of Greece .
This was criticized strongly at that time . But the political agreement in Germany is fact that were , the public one and this one published opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece .
Merkel finally comes out anew with a clear position within the last few October days . She demands a reform of the agreements of the European Union to bear a part of the costs to make the rescue of a country possible and engage the private lenders simultaneously .
Became this position as interpreted anti European since she advanced the Irland crisis and all following .
But her suggestion if sweetened also a little was accepted . Within the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which shall make these measures possible as of 2013 .
Germany has drawn a red line which does not intend to exceed it .
It tells everyone that the old operation of the euro will not exist any more as of this appointment even if unpopular measures must be taken now .
2013 will this one be the year of birth of a new currency room , in which countries are punished hard for offenders , being able to be forced to explain oneself insolvent and in this case must the private sector take on a part of the costs .
Germany shows us that we must smash a hard expansionist policy with high economize and rates of investment , moderation of consumption , improvement on the productivity and competitiveness as well as positive foreign-trade balances .
The other alternative which is based on indebtedness and building and construction industry with gigantic holes in the balance of payments , was specified by Spain in boom times like her simply will not be accepted .
The supply is clear .
And we would do to this badly not to understand it .
It is not all about only to power the government 's deficit on three per cent up to the year 2013 .
The demands are much more mandatory .
And it is the worst which we could do under these conditions to deceive us ourselves .
I hope that the present turbulences change into more leisure .
And that , until spring 2013 , we will use the possibilities which are commanded to us .
It seems that Zapatero has understood this also that way and rejects his double announcement ( the promised reforms according to the meeting with the large-scale enterprises on last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday ) at this that has establish the hypothesis , order despite the criticism of Merkel in the house of one 's own , prepared himself her way .
But the red line drawn by Germany is there and does not see it so out that something would change to this .
Under the possibilities taken into consideration this one is not ruling out that we must leave the euro zone crammed full with little serious countries .
In this case Germany still could tell us it has warned us .
