CDC allergic to publish guidelines for schools
Published on Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) is a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies among children in schools .
These are the first such directives issued by the US Government , as the number of school-age children with food allergies is increasing .
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .
The prevalence of food allergies among children , according to the CDC , between 1997 and 2007 increased by 18 percent .
The guidelines include information for schools , the faculty and staff to raise awareness about food allergies and how to deal with children who are allergic reactions .
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin stock - the injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used - a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction .
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules , so that schools can keep stock Epinephrin easier .
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms of children who have an allergic reaction .
Children may say : `` It feels as if something is on my tongue , '' `` My tongue feels as if a hair is better , '' or `` My tongue . ''

Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which the tail is wagging the dog with his mood .
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the cock stretched more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while the left side was nervous dogs .
But now , scientists say that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and be able to respond .
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : `` When people are well aware that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to stimuli , causing the positive or negative emotions . ''
Here we have tried to look at this in other species .
He also noticed that dogs , like humans , the speech for the movement of the left side was responsible and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .
To learn more about how dogs on the side of the tail is wagging their brethren , the researchers monitored the animals , while these films of other dogs .
They measured the heart rate of the dog and analysed the behaviour .
Probably we will soon understand why the tail in one , in the other direction .
Professor Vallortigara said : `` We have shown the dogs movies with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette , in order to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we were able to make the movement of the tail more control to the left or to the right . ''
When they saw how an otherwise expression of loose dog the tail has moved to the right ( from the perspective of the fronds of dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .
But was the tail tilt to the left ( again , from the perspective of the dog , the wags ) , your heart rate rose and they saw restless .
In the opinion of Professor Vallortigara , the dogs were not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs had learnt from experience , in which movements they worry if and when they are not .
He said : `` If you have several encounters with other dogs and the Wedeln with the cock in one direction rather with friendly behaviour and the right side is a less friendly behaviour , then it is on the basis of this experience . ''
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal could help .
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of animal husbandry at the University of Bristol , said that this is not the first study , which has been investigated , whether on the left and right is important for dogs .
Last year , a team from the University of Lincoln that dogs turn your head to the left , if they see an aggressive dog , and to the right , if it is a happy dog .
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , said the following : `` Dogs tend to go on , if a robot dog , tail wag '' on the left and the right , rather than the other way around years - than in the Italian study. ``
According to his statement could stir the differences so that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the films or the robot dogs are not as dogs .
A study of how dogs react to real dogs , could help , he said .
`` Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that both halves to be used for different purposes , but many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception , '' said Bradshaw .
But simply because their behaviour record , it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes in one , sometimes in the other direction .

Court decision to block the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk-Richtlinie
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the formation of a judge , the changes to the Stop-and-Frisk-Programm ( `` stop and search '' ) of the New York Police Department had demanded , and for the judge of the case .
The 2nd repercussions said that the decisions by Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal is decided in the city .
The judge had ruled in August that the city goes against the Constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and questioning people will be implemented .
The city appealed against their assessment and ordered remedial measures , including the decision to set up an observatory , which the police with the amendment of the directive and the corresponding training programme should support .
The Court of Appeal on Tuesday heard the arguments for the suspension .
The appeal report stated that the judge should be relieved of the case , because it violates the Code of Conduct for U.S . Judges , specifying that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship ; this was , in part , with a series of media interviews and public statements , in which they publicly responded to the criticism of the Court .
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop and Frisk program were targeted .
It has appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of key changes , including reforms to policies , training and supervision , and ordered a pilot programme with the body worn cameras in areas in which most of the checks were carried out .
In August , the city of New York , the practice of storing the names and addresses of people to quit , following an inspection by the police .
An oral hearing on the appeal is scheduled for March 14 , 2014 .
The Stop-and-Frisk-Taktik was made by a number of civil rights advocates criticized .
It is this type of inspection for decades in various forms , but increased the number of recorded controls during the term of the other independents Mayor Michael Bloomberg at an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .
In 2004 by four men , who were all minorities have complained that developed into a class action lawsuit .
Supporters of the changes say the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk-Programm , the changes will put an end to unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way as other police chiefs of the ruling .
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police , but not the crime ; it would also waste money and the wider problem of a police force is not resolved , after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade under pressure .
The judge pointed out that they do not finish the Stop-and-Frisk-Praxis , constitutional , but only the kind of implementation of controls by the NYPD reformiere .

Parents of sexual children can choose `` gender undetermined . ''
Germany is the first European nation , in which a third gender is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia .
Newborn will no longer rigidly male or female .
Under the new law , parents have no sex more for those children , but `` undecided '' or `` not fixed '' on the birth certificate .
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents , so that they do not make any hasty decisions relating to operations for a gender assignment in newborns , and the people of sexual discrimination .
A internationell sexual person said , according to BBC years later : `` I am neither man nor woman . ''
I remain the mess that has been created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
An estimated one in 2,000 children each year , either as a boy or a girl .
They belong to the sexual , a group that fall under the diagnosis `` sexual differentiation disorder '' ( DSD ) , an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes , gonads ( ovaries or testes ) or unusually developed genital mutilation .
Wallis Simpson was perhaps the sexually .
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but the majority of experts in the United States , we should have the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible , and not on the psychological and physical development of children wait before you - if at all - for an operation to decide .
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , on the issue of gender identification , said that the new German law `` sounds like a good thing . ''
Inter sexual children are an ethical dilemma .
`` Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but for most children , this is not true , '' he said .
You can make a sex allocation without surgery and then wait and see how the identity of morality .
The scientific data on how a child 's gender identity at all , are not very closely .
No one knows why it happens .
It is like the mystery of why people are gay .
In a report to the European Commission in 2011 , it says , sexual people are transsexual or transgender people , because their status is not sex , but by their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female exclusively , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .
These properties were subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structure and hormones .
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination which inter sexual and transgender people face in the workplace and on the level of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .
Not with the Equality image matching boys now have a special camp .
It is now in Australia and Nepal for adults , on official documents male , female or `` third gender . ''
In June , Australian Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) , the world 's first `` loose '' person after a court recognised the lifelong maintaining a `` fixed '' gender status was granted .
German cards alongside M and W will have a third assignment , X for sexually , the Ministry of the Interior .
In neighbouring France gender issues are still controversial , as a news story on France 24 .
2011 signed dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country a petition that the 'gender theory `` should be removed from textbooks .
The Web site Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law , saying : `` If the world is being dragged into a new state , where sex is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we twist two other pillars of civilisation . ''
The mother of a newborn in Maryland told baby zone , they think it would be better if babies at birth is assigned to one gender .
`` The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you are not the sex of your child knows , '' she said of the parents .
Children need stability and security .
Historically , the children were with both male and female sex parts were born , known as Hermaphroditen , after the Greek god of both sexes .
Ten years ago , the medicine was the sex as something you could wipe out and then rebuild .
But in the meantime , the ethical foundations of an operation in doubt , now that we know how complex the gender identity , and that doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child growing up with their assigned gender .
`` In the middle of the twentieth century , called this a '' psychiatric emergency , `` said Drescher .
If such a child was born , then they called the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals is Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University , which is considered the sex .
He coined the term `` gender identity '' and argued that social and environmental initiatives - such as the parents of a child educate-interacted with the genes and hormones and a child so as to whether a person is male or female .
But in the `` John / Joan '' case from 1966 his theories have been controversial .
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision , to neuter the child and also to remove his testicles and then bring up as a girl .
`` Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , but he was not , '' said Drescher .
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married to a woman .
With 38 but he committed suicide .
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who practice this model .
But in the 1990s , with the advent of the Internet , are survivors of those sex operations to the public , `` not happy with the result . ''
Such as Jim Bruce , a 36 year-old author from Montana , who was born with XY-männlichen chromosomes , but ambiguous genitalia .
The doctors were not made clear whether he has a large clitoris or had a small penis and were convinced that he could never be a `` satisfactory life '' as a man .
So its external body and shortly after birth the testicles surgically removed in 1976 , and he was brought up as a girl .
At the age of 12 , he was awarded female hormones .
`` I knew that I am not a girl , '' he said on ABCNews.com
I was unhappy , but it was really hard to ask questions .
At the age of 18 , he should receive a vaginoplasty .
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical records .
What he found was shocking .
I was at my birth sterile - and nobody has ever said to me .
Bruce was born with a DSD , through his body not enough testosterone to the development of the genitals could produce .
After he had learned the truth , he moved back to the male identity , received Testosteron-Injektionen and was to remove his breasts .
The operation , he has become infertile .
Today , he is fighting for others in an organisation called Interface Project that inter sexual people perceived as normal .
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , director of rights group based in California Advocates for Informed Choice , is concerned that the German law `` for stamping and encourage Basque . ''
`` Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child , not to '' set , `` she said .
We fear that favours intervention .
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait and see .
But we still do not know how the law will impact , so we can only speculate .
Tamar-Mattis said that their organisation to support the Australian law , because `` it allows adults recognition as a third sex . ''
`` Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex to meet , '' she said .
The German law relates to the allocation of childbirth .
This is not a fight that small children should force at this time .
When they grow up , they themselves can decide on their bodies .
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast Radio login from Pitt , a daughter with a sexual differentiation disruption , and hundreds of others in a support group , says that the German law `` authorize '' both parents and children .
Baratz 's daughter Katie , who was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz .
Because of the faulty receptor cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics .
She has a vagina , but no uterus and ovaries .
This is Katie 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a researcher in child psychiatry .
While it is barren , hopes , however , through the adoption of a child or a surrogate mother .
`` The law gives parents room , where they do n't have to make decisions in haste , '' Baratz said .
It gives them the time , various tests and to clarify things and gives them time , before they `` male '' or `` female '' writing .
In this way , everything is in order , the child and loves it .
We have a wonderful baby and the parents .
And we must not rush to carry out an operation that can no longer be undone .
`` That includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are concerned , because they believe that they would not do the right thing , '' she explained .
Finally , the child decides on the sex , the more suitable for him - and this is wonderful .
This will enable children to take the decision itself .

The disposable society does not think
The night was long , the music was loud and the mood is good , but at some point , it is home .
Only : In the bellies of the people on the front and back , the hunger .
Clearly , this may be the one or other cocktail or champagne to be responsible .
What is more , when chilled to the nearest drive-in , in order to take a bite ?
I admit that I am happy with it , if it is late at night or early in the morning to get fast food .
A couple of French fries and a Coke , Burger - and by home and go to bed !
But on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry Disco-Gängern .
Because what must be a constant regularity that its fast-food bags out of the car window ? !
Especially at the weekends are discarded paper in urban areas and parking lots .
`` Why ? , '' I wonder .
The people are too stupid to the bags home or until the next bin ?
It is not only that the paper stuff disfigured the landscape .
Bags have already covered transport facilities such as crash barriers and caused by accidents .
So what does the `` disposable society '' but not , presumably , they do not even know what the word means .
If you travel more often in the evenings , especially with several people in the car , you know , as a back seat after celebrating nights : Clothes , bottles and other rubbish are there .
There are a couple of bags , more or less , but nothing - in contrast to the street , where none of the other rumtrampeln pigswill .
I can see the day will come when the removal of the cities and municipalities to stupid - and the fast food chains for their bags must demand deposit .

Clive Palmer claims , Prime Minister Tony Abbott have conflict with parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says , Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters pregnant and therefore could benefit from it .
The mining magnate , who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , challenged the assertion , as he was brushed aside questions about whether he is in conflict .
The Palmer United Party could be up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for the decision as to whether the carbon and mining taxes will be cut or eliminated .
But Palmer claimed that only ministers may have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott personally would benefit from the legislation .
`` It is located in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not they will stay , '' said Palmer .
Two months after the election , the electoral commission said Palmer ahead with 53 votes after the recount the winner of the Sunshine-Coast-Sitzes of Fairfax .
Palmer called for a review of the process of counting to go faster .
Tony Abbotts daughters Frances and Bridget .
If these elections two months after the end of the vote ?
`` We need a better system , '' he said .
Why should we have a system in which you enter , the data into a computer , and then immediately is at 6 : 30 p.m. the result ?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils with marking the ballot .

NSA says , an `` internal error '' and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
The National Security Agency , said late on Friday , a mistake have crippled its public website for a few hours and not hackers , as has been claimed online .
`` NSA.gov was last night unavailable for several hours , during a planned updates an internal error occurred , '' explained the spy agency sent in an e-mail message .
The problem will be fixed on this evening .
The claim that the failure was carried out by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) , is not true .
In the early evening was online server trackers have noticed that the NSA-Website at least six hours was not available and this can not continue for some users .
Earlier , a spokesman for the NSA to ABC News said that the sensitive internal network of the authority was `` in no way compromised . ''
Secret information were not at risk , according to the spokesman .
At least one group , said that the NSA-Website paralysed with a DDoS attack .
In such attacks , the target website with sites flooded , until the server overload and the site will collapse .
The cyber tactic is relatively simple and the attacks are not the target in the internal network .
The super secret NSA , whose nickname was once No search Agency ( no such authority ) that is now in the bright light of the public and , according to the announced in recent months , revelations about her extensive monitoring severe criticism at home and abroad - a result of the secret from disaffected former NSA-Mitarbeiter had been stolen and published .
The growing controversy surrounding the secret service radiate initial speculation about the incident today is the result of a targeted Cyperoperation .

A black box in the car ?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to the decaying highway system repair , and believe the solution in a small black box to the dashboard of the car .
The devices , which each mileage record and report the information to the authorities , are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the agencies of the federal states , the outdated system for financing American roads .
The normally rather boring field of road planning suddenly has an intense debate with colourful alliances .
Libertarian have allied with environmental groups and support for the government of the small boxes for recording the mileage - and possibly even where they were driven - and then use the information for the calculation of tax modest .
The Tea Party is horrified .
The American Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and a series of data protection issues .
But while in Congress could not agree on an approach , several states wait no longer .
You are currently examining how it over the next ten years to move to a system in which drivers pay per mile travelled .
Thousands of drivers have a tachograph , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring , have already been tested .
This really is a must for our country .
`` There is nothing that we may use only , '' said Hasan Ikhrata , executive director of the Southern California Assn . of governments , which is a record of driving miles on all California motorists in the state in 2025 .
The way in which we pay these taxes will change .
The technology is there .
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from taxation , the Americans pay at the pump , broke .
But in America will no longer needs as much as before .
Cars that consume less fuel .
The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased in 20 years .
Politicians do not dare to high fuel prices , the tax by a penny .
`` The economy is simply not sustainable , '' says Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .
His state has recently 500 cars equipped with a black box , with which a miles based payment system to be tested .
`` This is the best option in the long term , '' he said .
Bureaucrats call it miles based user fee .
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , the way to reduce congestion and greenhouse gases .
The Californian designers rely on the system for the preparation of strategies with which the ambitious , legally binding objectives of the state of climate change are to be achieved .
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he is the most viable long-term alternative .
The free marketer of the Reason Foundation are fond of the idea , drivers pay according to a pre-arranged route .
`` This is not a tax , which disappear into a black hole , '' said Adrian Moore , vice president for policy at the Reason .
The people directly pay for what they get .
The movement is also supported by two former American ministers who , in a report in 2011 had urged Congress to move towards miles based billing .
Last year , the Senate approved a $ 90 million expensive pilot project , which includes 10,000 cars .
But the majority in the House of Representatives hindered the thrust and thereby responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas represent the people who , on a daily basis , often many miles on the way to work or have to travel into the city .
Several states and cities move nonetheless , on his own initiative in this direction .
The most active forum is Oregon , which currently 5,000 driver for the country 's largest experiment being recruited .
This will soon be the mileage fees instead of paying tax to the state .
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .
New York City also is considering such a .
It is testing ziibi limited with trucks .
And the I-95-Koalition , the departments of 17 states on the East Coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .
The concept is not a universal hit .
In Nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices , motorists were sceptical of the idea that the government could track their movements .
`` Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem , '' explains Alauddin Khan , head of strategy and product management at the Department of Transportation of Nevada .
People wanted to do it .
When the trial started , warned the ACLU of Nevada on their website : `` It would be relatively easy , the tachograph to turn adult monitoring devices . ''
There is no need for a huge , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used , data on the daily movements of individuals .
Nevada is one of a number of states , which are now looking for affordable technology , with which the state can collect the mileage , but not exactly when and where .
So , as Khan , would also be confident the public .
The pursuit of this technology has some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California .
The company is not originally for states in the field of taxation on motorists to help .
Rather , it was their aim , in an emerging market for car insurance , in which drivers pay based on miles driven .
But the devices are tested for the road planners are interesting because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information regularly via modem .
`` People are more willing to participate if their speed and location not be recorded , '' said Ryan Morrison , CEO of True Mileage .
In some of these public pilot programmes were made big mistakes .
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement it .
In Oregon , the planners that motorists are experimenting with a number of choices .
You can opt for a device with or without GPS .
Or they take absolutely no device and instead pay a flat rate based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles .
Others hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public to equip devices with more functions than with little .
In New York City , transport officials want to develop a device for taxation , which is also pay parking , insurance only for driving distances must be paid and speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams .
`` Motorists with the added value of the benefits the system offers , motivated to participate , '' says a planning document of the city .
Some traffic planners wonder , however , whether all the talk about the pay per mile is not just a huge red herring .
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission on the territory of the San Francisco Bay , officials said , Congress , the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing the tax on fuel .
An additional fee or an annual tax could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume less fuel , so that they pay a fair share .
`` There is no reason for an operation , but is also an aspirin , '' said Randy Rentschler , the head of the Commission 's legislative and public affairs .
If we do that , hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy , and many other things .

Although the result of my endeavours was demonstrably positive , my government treated dissent as a loyalty and aims to criminalise political expression and under indictment .
However , the truth is not a crime .
I am confident that the government of the United States , with the support of the international community , this bad habit .
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation is resolved , will be able to stick to the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , in particular with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports , appropriate and in accordance with the law .

New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine , which could spoil the fun of smoking .
A single dose of the vaccine in mice could protect against a lifetime of smoking .
In tests on humans are still needed further trials , which can last for a few years , but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .
`` We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop all methods available in the market have tried , but had discovered that their smoking is stronger than these approaches , '' said Cornell .
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was changed so that the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .
The virus selective the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .
The antibodies hunting the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , causing a smoker no nicotine High .
In experiments were vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered to their normal level of activity .
Mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a break , `` the researchers said , a sign that the nicotine their brains .
The experiments , described in the journal Science in translational medicine .
Former tobacco out of vaccines , because it contained antibodies .
The vaccinations for maintaining the Antikörperpegels had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical .
But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be much lower because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories .
As Professor Crystal said , could be a future vaccine for people when he was quite sure children before they enter into temptation , to try a cigarette and tobacco addiction .
More likely , however , is that smokers would use it to stop .
`` You know , if they start smoking again , they feel because of the nicotine vaccine , no fun anymore , and this helps them to the habit , '' he explained .
British scientists said the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research is necessary .

US : `` Super tunnel '' discovered the drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States , investigators have a `` super tunnel '' for drug smuggling was discovered and shut down .
As the US Customs , was the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity , rail and a ventilation system .
Three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana , and seized nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine .
The tunnel was reportedly has not yet been taken into use .
`` These cartels are stupid , if they think they could get under the radar by digging , '' said the General of US-Distrikts Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where one end of the tunnel was discovered .
The gangs assured Duffy wrote : `` If you continue to build tunnels and tries to use them , we are determined to a huge waste of your dirty money . ''
Both the US and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drug cartels .
Since 2006 in Mexico , more than 77 000 people killed in connection with the crime .
Designed by experts
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators believe that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction of about a year .
The track layout was so that there could be used electrically powered cars .
On the Mexican side is in a building that is 80 metres from the border .
According to authorities , a director of 20 meters in the depths of the tunnel entrance .
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 cm width .

The British government has announced a study that the benefits of increasing HS2-Eisenbahnprojekts for Scotland .
In the work of hs2 Ltd is proposed , with the start of Phase 1 in 2026 high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England .
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project `` will be Great Britain closer together . ''
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased with the British government to work on this plan .
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .
After the completion of Phase 2 will have connections to Manchester and Leeds .
In June , the government revised the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed road between London and the north of £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion .
The British government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has commissioned hs2 Ltd , after further routes capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland .
This includes the possibility of cash at the end of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .
Baroness Kramer said : `` Our aim for hs2 is a truly national network , the United Kingdom and its cities closer together . ''
We are proceeding with hs2 , because there are huge advantages .
Without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
But it is also about the link between 18 UK cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , thanks to hs2 .
The Scottish Secretary Alistair Pepsi commented : `` Today 's announcement is good news for Scotland . ''
On behalf of the Scottish Government asked Keith Brown Pepsi , `` unequivocally '' for the Scottish involvement in the HS2-Netzwerk .
Brown said : `` The high speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but also the strength of Scotland an argument for fast rail links across the UK . ''
We are therefore pleased to be a partner of the British government to work and the options for a high speed rail link in Scotland to investigate the benefits for all and the Glasgow-Edinburgh added , which the Scottish Government is already planning .
I look forward to the report with the British ministers in the next year to study and work together to decide on the next steps .

Veganism is emerging as the vegetarianism , differs from this but in a very significant way .
For vegetarians , the consumption of cream cake , ice or a strong Edam , they are not on the menu of a Veganers .
Milk , cheese , egg , in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegans from all the consumption of animal products - including honey is denied .
What , you may wonder , but on closer examination , the vegan nutrition world by a considerable ingenuity .
`` Sandwich spreads are very popular , '' says Ute Henkel man , the owner of the local reform House , which has a variety of special products for vegans .
Reuben London also visited the store in the Domgasse .
For 13 years , the native New Zealanders vegan lives in ( almost ) everything he finds what he needs to live . `` In 1997 , I was in my diet and vegetarian . ''
At the turn of the century , then took the next step and I was vegan .
`` The conviction but not only because of the food , but because of the shoe choice , '' says London , the artificial normal leather .
He acknowledged that there are also other everyday issues without animal products .
First and foremost , be vegan is an ethics .
`` I do not want that animals have to die for me , '' says protecting the maxim of vegans , who on the whole consumption .
Instead of burgers , Rühreiern or rubber bears mourn after , the vegans quickly discovered a completely new products , which increased enthusiasm .
`` It is a double bonus , '' says London today , `` be vegan actually represents a waiver , no prayer , but it is an asset . '' The assumption that the changes to the selection of dining options , London and more on the power of habit .
And these conditions also had some even well-intentioned attempt fail .
`` The addictive is a crucial factor that leaves many give up quickly , similar to smoking , '' scorched-earth is a comparison .
And : `` Certain tastes are not depending on the animal . ''
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation , which make up the taste .
`` But it is also in a different way to produce the same effect , '' says the vegans .
For example , at a barbecue , protecting such as aubergines , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages .
He takes on a balanced , varied diet , and taste the dishes .
Of course , we would like to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .
`` It should taste , but it is not only to reduce animal food , '' says London .
Damage to health and eating disorders , another widespread adoption , he did not .
For me , the transition was a positive aspect .
I take no foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content .
There are high performance athletes , which only vegan diet .
`` My blood values are well , I am often check , '' says Proctor .
In particular , the lack of vitamin B12 warn many Vegansimus-Kritiker .
`` As animals fed with feed , rather than on the pasture to graze , it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer , Vitamin-B12-Anteil is high , '' scorched-earth takes place .
For vegans , there is also the possibility that the products in the form of tablets .
`` My B12-Werte are in order , '' he explains .
Long distances should realize for the food supply .
Finally , there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has now soya milk and other products .
Everything I need , I think .
And I buy something special .
`` Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but that applies to '' ordinary `` finished products as well . ''
In any case , the preparation of our dishes are much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed .
`` In the restaurant , there is a lot to discover , with a few small tips can be good , if not better results , in part , '' says London .
Margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheesecake could realize his in-laws to delight .
Strictly vegan gives a new condiment .
The dynamics when you cook together , has a new significance .
`` The situations that can arise , are as diverse as the people themselves , '' says London .
He was , of course , but also scepticism prevails .
My food tastes you no longer ?
`` Now I feel bad because I drink milk ? '' - the kind of questions you should act as vegans with sensitivity .
`` I reject the people do not , I am part of this society , '' Proctor would not enclaves .
And then examined the everyday world is not vegan as suspects - and the vegan is not restricted in everyday life , as is commonly believed .
Even fast food is allowed .
Fries everywhere !
`` Many Döner delis , falafel , or a vegetarian Yufka , '' says London .
He is in a pizzeria on pasta , or order a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .
The restaurants are so slow .
`` When I started 13 years ago , I have to eat vegan , everything was much more difficult , '' the New Zealanders can find a development : `` You talk to people , they point out . ''
`` If sufficient demand , perhaps they are inclined to complement the menu , '' he hopes .
Vegan restaurants are developing , such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café bird .
London has the desire that other restaurants at least a 08 dish on the menu .
Basically , there are vegan dishes for everyone .
Everyone can eat them , so they are precisely the opposite of exclusively .
`` Meat are not exclusive , and in the truest sense of the word , because they are different , '' Proctor .
`` If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way for the most part , to make impossible from the outset , '' says London .
But the purchase vegan products can be a little difficult at the beginning .
Especially when you learn to understand that color additives in animal farming donors may be included , it seems to comply with the ethics with so many hurdles and traps the courage to leave .
Not only have therefore Reuben London and Lars Thomsen wrote a book : `` Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives , '' explains the many ingredients , food and cleaning products are buried .
`` And we developed a scanner and know what signs and logos to respect you , '' It is sometimes better than small steps to stop or stumble , `` London .
Veganism , he is an important moral signal that the awareness .
Perhaps he is not quite that his habits , but at least he can teach consumers , his habits .

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA employee Jonathan Lord due before charges against accused of sex offences
Two YMCA-employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) are for sex offences has been charged in connection with children before 2011 accusations against the childcare Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children .
But the opening statement before the Commission had the YMCA stated that it was `` never in the organization with an incident of sexual abuse had to do . ''
Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee indicted for crimes involving child pornography , and another in which a teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 because of the abuse he had been sentenced to deal with children .
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission 's assistance , a lawyer that he warned of the first case , the second but not before .
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA in relation to the Commission is also inaccurate in the claim , `` it was external reviews of the YMCA , in which the YMCA as at the forefront of child safety has been recognised . ''
Evidence of the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he was the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( 2002 ) in August of this year .
Hare , with 21 at the YMCA , admitted that the company had `` from me downwards '' in the recruitment of Lord failed and not to ensure that employees are aware of their obligations and infringement of the directives on child safety .
Lord was the beginning of the year because of sexual assaults against 12 boys during his two years of activity for the YMCA .
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
But Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem , the employees have prevented from Lords violations in relation to the safety of children .
The staff said that they had seen violations , among other things , that Lord alone with children , she worked as a babysitter , she was sitting on his lap , said that he was delighted , and children play with his mobile phone .
Danielle Ockwell , whose boss Lord and asked for a training on child protection , because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the children 's services director Jacqui Barnat , the YMCA Caringbah , a Lords was `` very intimidating and most of the time was very remote . ''

Basharat form , 42 , gave information to continue under world size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction could come to light
Liverpool Crown Court he was sentenced to three years in prison
A well-known criminal defender , a drugs baron with a major police investigation , because he was afraid his secret addiction could be revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
Basharat form , 42 , disappeared under the world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade , after looking through his own cocaine had been compromised .
The Kriminalisten as `` first class '' vaunted lawyer with the nickname `` Bash '' was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the police had monitored Scarborough , which he represented in a previous drug procedures .
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , parenting , while this with colleagues during a meal at the Bar .
The investigation brought to light that form of class A drugs regularly consumed after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet and credit cards were found .
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he attempted unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners .
All four suspects were from the police as part of a major corporation to Heroin- and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .
Along with 32 other people were later arrested after the police during a series of raids heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash .
Legally , 42 , gave information to criminals , because he feared that his drug addiction can not be known .
Today , filling in for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice found guilty and sentenced .
He admitted at an earlier hearing to cocaine possession .
The lawyer was convicted after the police in their investigations against Scarborough found that this in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Turkey .
Two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas House and the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove in the dustbin of the lawyer .
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs , called Scarborough regularly with Turkey , at dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park .
The lawyer returned home , took drugs and then nine messages exchanged between the two .
In court , it became known that form a regular consumer of cocaine , after tests of Class A drugs in his hair , his wallet and credit cards were discovered .
L was later arrested but denied to take cocaine , and said that he had spoken with the alleged dealer , because this was his client , and claimed that their discussion is governed by the `` lawyer secret . ''
During his arrest form took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they have been secured and he was taken from a hair sample .
He was in the police interrogation , both in his home and in the workplace , an office and clients it at home because of legal issues .
In court , it was announced that the major players in the drug trade , some of which he had earlier called for significant arrests and had informed about what the investigators knew about them .
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : `` A criminal law should know better than anyone else that breaking the law . ''
Is this form of abuse of his position as defence lawyers accused , because he is too much with certain clients .
The relationship is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs .
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer for these people .
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
He was the police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .
Mr form brought his profession into disrepute .
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he caused that his independence was compromised .
Wrote , any wrongdoing , and said : `` If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , then I would not wait for 15 hours , but do it right away . ''
But after the hearing , said superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire : `` Mr wrote , the step from a criminal to a criminal in the moment when he started to buy drugs from organised criminals . ''
His cocaine addiction led to a desperate compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime , which hired him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .
Lawyers must uphold the highest standards of integrity and public trust and confidence .
L has betrayed that trust and tries to get behind the façade of his profession .
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Turkey , in three cases to a conviction for possession of cocaine and obstructing justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .
This case should serve as a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
We will find you and bring you to justice .
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison on the conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade declared guilty .
Thirty-five others ' people were involved in the drug trade to total penalties of 153 years sentence for drug offences .
Published on its website a collecting area with questions and answers about where he is , his dream job , as a lawyer for clients on death row in America , his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work .

Gutach : More safety for pedestrians
You are not 100 yards apart : Tuesday is the new B 33-Fußgängerampel in Gutach at the village car park in operation - within sight of the old town hall .
Two installations so close to each other : Intention or folly ?
This question has been answered clearly Gutachs mayor yesterday .

`` According to current measurements through the B 33 around 12 000 vehicles in the municipality of Gutach , about ten percent of heavy traffic , '' said Arnold .
So is the construction of a new traffic light is more than necessary : `` Security is simply , '' says Arnold .

It was , according to Arnold in the siting of the traffic light poles previously tested everything : `` Using a specially for us with extra long Holzstämmen loaded trucks we have ever engaged in , whether these vehicles from the Sulzbachweg exit onto B 33 without the traffic light poles umzuknicken .

The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights of the car drivers , for example , when the sun is good .
And economically , it is also : The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .
There are three lights per direction .
Arnold said the technology of the new facility is equipped with two radar sensors .
The traffic light pushes the button , tests the upper radar sensor the traffic .
The street is free , just green for pedestrians , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .

Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Against the former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales , an investigation by the state corruption on view .
The former NSW-Minister denies the regulations on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid to have changed , the covert investments in three properties on state controlled land .
The Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ­ Independent Commission against Corruption ) on Friday extended its investigations on the question of whether different Minister Obeid influenced such leases at Circular Quay , where the Obeids two restaurants and a cafe , without tender after their expiration in August 2005 .
Now , because of the accusation , Tripodi said of Obeids concealed interest in the land , after Tripodis former deputy team leader Lynne Ashpole accordingly on Thursday .
In years of talks , which began in 2005 , the government had to public tenders for the leases .
Tenants were opposed to it , and also wanted to longer maturities .

You could call him the Dostoyevsky in the United States .
Philip K. Dick was a god , a meta physicist , his novels and stories have something serial .
Amazingly the kinship abroad : The sharp eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
And so , as Fyodor Dostoevsky , with its massive oeuvre as Ergründer and apologist for the Russian soul , read Philip K. Dick as American prophet , there is something in their own country .
Some of the titles are published in the mid-to-late publisher , which sells Haffmans-Kassette with 118 stories Zweitausendeins .
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological advances , coupled with paranoia , obsession and the faith , to be chosen .
Thick had God experiences , his later books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .
Perhaps he was crazy , had drugs added to his brain .
He has already figured , early on that the computer Divinitäten .
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what differentiates humans from a machine , the creator of his creation .
This is the 'Blade Runner ' problem .
The killing .
A master of science fiction .
A fantastic writer .
His stories have directors such as Ridley Scott , Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg .
This story is particularly significant .
`` Minority Report '' dates back to the year 1956 , he exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy-Tribunale .
It is the principle of `` pre- crime ' , ' pre-crime ' , in other words , what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House .
In Dick 's world , which is our shocking , mutants in the future and to the police .
`` We collect against individuals who have broken no law , '' says the head of the authority .
`` We catch them before they can commit a violent crime . ''
And : `` In our society , there are no criminals , we have a colony of Pesudoverbrecher . '' You read time flows .
They assume that bad things are happening , and prevent the criminal idea into practice .
Dick 's story acts as the blueprint for the FDA and the NSA Abhörrausch .
Anticipation of the attack : So does Obama 's drones philosophy and practice .
But Dick 's story is not yet at an end .
The police chief complains that there is no separation of powers , the military controls the everyday life - and what is left by the state .
Then the monitor itself monitors and a future crime .
The system is .
It is perfect , but it is lying .
It creates its own conditions .
Errors and victims is not only accepted , but builds on itself .
The system creates the risk that it fights .
Philip K. Dick read is , again and again , to get closer to the truth .

Europe 's elite is prepared to do business with the UK ?
Business for Britain was launched in April , with the intention of the economy , to bring to the table and to define what those in Britain for prosperity and work , in our relations with the EU .
To this end , we have the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they are about Britain , the economy and the EU .
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders , the British companies , sectors and regions .
The results of the survey will surprise many .
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe and focused on countries to modernise and grow , while states in the EU will stagnate .
They want the government to new trade links with countries such as China , India and Brazil are promoted , instead of dealing with the long and arduous process , to reform the obscure institutions .
Asked for their opinion on certain legal issues - from fair trading legislation to product legislation - the majority of business leaders think that control over the key competences should be returned to Westminster .
There was a general dissatisfaction with the internal market , since according to the company , the cost of the Brussels rules now would outweigh the advantages to be part of Europe 's trade - even 40 percent of large companies , which have traditionally voted the most Europhile .
Finally , and this is probably the most , our survey of business leaders that a clear majority of Britain a course in the direction of change in the agreement and wants a relationship with the EU based on trade , not on politics .
This recognition for companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is on a `` meaningful change '' which the tiller will bring back to the UK .
There is a lot of - a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would be a change at 16 per cent in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : This survey shows that the British economy behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK 's terms of EU membership .
It also shows that the company from a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain .
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro zone is now in the direction of closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority should be jobs and growth in Britain , as the result of our survey shows what companies greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in approach to regulation .

Anger over judgement for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people in the bombing in Bali in 2002 killed , were angry about the verdict for the last of the plotters , who was put on trial , because Umar Patek they believe state law should be shot .
Patek , nearly ten years as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia , was yesterday for his role in the building of explosives for the bombing to a sentence of 20 years .
With suspended , he could be released after 15 years .
The 45 year old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta , in which 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many more were injured .
There has also been a guilty verdict in a number of terrorism related charges , including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .
The prosecution had asked for a life sentence , even if it is for the man who , because of his reputation as a master bomb maker - also known as `` Demolition Man '' to apply the death penalty .
The decision has sparked painful memories in June Corteen , a mother from Perth , the 39 year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in Patek and his Mitverschwörern devastation caused nearly ten years ago .
Fighting back tears , she said , Patek could be sentenced to death .
I mean , he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
`` It should be put before a firing squad , '' said Corteen to AAP .
I have to live with it every day , that I will have no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters .
The Sari Club was razed to the ground , on 12 October 2002 , shortly after 11 p.m. , a powerful bomb exploded in a light truck , which was parked in front of the nightclub .
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds before a suicide bombers detonate a backpack filled with explosives .
After the attack , he fell into a coma for a month and `` died '' three times while he was on a life support system .
Hughes said that Patek , deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiah-Amrozi , Mukhlas and Imam Samudra , who were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago .
Really , this guy should get the death penalty .
Let him alive - no , there is no reason to keep it alive .
20 years on , after he 202 people were killed and hundreds injured , is not much .
Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber , who was in court .
He is almost a decade of detention , but was finally in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad , where US forces nearly four months later , the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killed .
During the trial , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had made the point that Patek was in Pakistan , in order to meet bin Laden with the aim of making the link between the Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .
`` He has not been asked , '' said Corteen .
Until recently , he has shown no remorse for it , how much pain he has caused to other people .
The ruling came before the 10th anniversary of the attack in this year , with commemorations in Bali and Australia .
`` This year there will be many tears , '' said Corteen .
Patek can still appeal against his sentence .

George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
It 's a new day , a new horror story to independence .
This time , we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .
This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and secured with barbed wire along the border of Hadrian 's Wall .
In fact , in the Strathclyde-Vorlage pointed to the potential economic benefits , the greater freedom of movement in the rest of Europe , but it was - as expected - in the headlines .
Also , nobody has mentioned that the EU Member States often bent their strict rules , if it is cheaper for them .
As Scotland is currently not in the Schengen area , would be the continued disregard for Brussels only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots .
So , in fact , no story .
And one that has been so in the years to come is that it is already a fossil like : The first time I have the `` independence means '' -Ente passport controls at least 40 years .
This is an interesting point in the constant repetition of this ancient history .
Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that after the European pipe dances ?
Why the London 's yoke , against the trade from Brussels , especially now ?
These are the real European news : The large , taken after the war plan for the unification of Europe is faltering .
With the euro crisis , the European project is officially dead .
Throughout the EU parties gaining ground , the EU-feindlich or the euro as a common currency would like to throw .
Even in Germany , the Eurosceptic party , Alternative for Germany , founded this year - nearly five million votes in the general election in September and effectively for the Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .
There has been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis is a turning point .
Because of the Berlin and the European Central Bank has imposed strict austerity measures in connection with the straitjacket in which the national economy by adhering to the single currency will be obliged , many people are of the opinion that the European project has gone too far .
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments can cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece .
Instead , the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates , which are beneficial for German exporters - and the German politicians would like .
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe with a built-in productivity in part to Germany .
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin .
Behind the current Etat- and currency problems lies a more profound European productivity problem .
As a result of the imposed by Brussels `` green '' energy directives - a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four for gas .
This is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have seen already in Grangemouth .
All wage system in the world to protect the European petrochemical industry , of cheap US shale gas to be pushed into a corner .
As a result , a revolt , especially in France , the former cheerleader of the EU .
After the war , the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle to Germany and Paris could stand on an equal footing with Washington .
But Berlin and Paris is no longer as a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy , which the ailing French economy .
The result : Marine Le Pen 's right-wing , EU-feindlicher Front National has just won a decisive choice and the ruling Socialists at number three .
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party , that they should not assume that a split on the right wing would automatically mean benefits for the left .
What makes Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white working class people ?
You would like to use the European elections next year , a Anti-EU- , Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .
If the opposition parties do well in these elections - and it is very possible , then , for the first time , the European Parliament is such a block .
This is the point I want to make : In the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency is the abolition of the euro .
The EU will not disappear , but it will be something like the `` Europe of sovereign nations , '' the General de Gaulle .
Germany and its satellite economies may keep the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .
I expect that Britain distanced himself from this project in the hope to curry favour with the US .
However , Washington 's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain alone in the Atlantic rain .
Where is Scotland in all this ?
We can decide , a region of ( ultimately ) small England .
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including , Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken .
I suspect that Scotland could be a looser Europe go quite well , as long as we keep our own currency .
Cooperation with other like-minded countries , is not in a federal Europe of Nations easier .
Otherwise , we should consider it Norway and keep our economic independence .
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and won ) cuts made to the Labour-Finanzminister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition had to answer for .
It would be ridiculous for Scotland , is now to decide on independence , only to then from Berlin and Brussels imposed austerity .

Security concerns grow in Mozambique because of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder and first president of Mozambique , in a rare public demonstration commemorating the call for peace .
`` We want peace , we want stability , '' said Vanessa de Sousa , managing director of an investment company .
Fear for the future of the country , it has its business attire for a T-shirt with the inscription `` We demand security '' traded in Portuguese , and on Thursday the crowd in Independence Square in the capital .
For two weeks , there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and RENAMO , which is one of the worst battles since the peace agreement , over 20 years ago .
It was once a notorious rebel movement RENAMO , which was initially ruled from White Rhodesia , and later the apartheid government of South Africa , in an effort to support the independent government to destabilise the country .
After the peace agreement of 1992 , it has become an opposition party .
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country back into a full-scale conflict back the case , but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals .
For the rapidly growing economy is a lot at stake , since the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest over the next few years , could investment of over 50 billion dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto , Vale of Brazil , Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US into the country .
The ruling Frelimo-Partei , the dominant force since 1975 , and RENAMO are blaming each other for the tensions .
RENAMO claims that the Government had provoked the recent clashes , on October 17 , by its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional stronghold of Renamos , attacked .
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo-Stützpunkte and tried to kill , Afonso Dhlakama , leader of the group , said Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times .
The government is RENAMO blamed for the clashes and accuses the organization , soldiers attacked .
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .
With AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as `` losers '' who `` all his remaining forces , in order to prove that he can impose on the government 's decisions . ''
Both Frelimo and RENAMO to stress that they want to avoid a war .
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that the peace agreement of 1992 RENAMO .
Compared to the FT , he said that he had said that the agreement was no longer Frelimo .
`` Our vision is to resume negotiations and it seriously , '' said Mazanga .
Previous talks between the parties have not helped to resolve the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year have been fired .
`` Here we have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) , who heads collide , '' says Joseph'Hanlon , a lecturer at the Open University and Mosambik-Experte .
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
RENAMO , which is pushing for electoral reform , has already stated that it will boycott the elections in November .
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
Some commentators have the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement interpreted , concessions and financial benefits from the government .
Shrink Renamos electoral success since 1992 , during a recent party , which was founded by a former Renamo-Mitglied Movimento respectively de Moçambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in the elections .
Mazanga said that Guebuza - whose resignation when his second term ends next year , the democracy of the country .
`` He does not want a multi-party democracy , he does not want a transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to give up the presidency , '' says Mazanga .
It is unclear what capacity RENAMO , but it has been disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south links .
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala , a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , Beira , however , the port , the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal .
In June , Rio a month suspended the use of the railways after RENAMO is an attack on the track .
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether RENAMO will repeat that threat .
`` RENAMO wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique , '' said Mazanga .
The instability have increased frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , Head of Media Coop , an independent media company , because many people were already due to corruption and the slow progress in the development and a recent kidnapping wave .
`` People think that the government and the President for the future of the country and he should be , the solutions to the problems , '' he says .
Omar sultans , a demonstrator , said , the people just wanted stability .
`` No wonder RENAMO and Frelimo , they just want to restore peace and usable roads , '' he said .

Fancy ice cream , which glows in the dark ?
A British businessman has the first glow in the dark ice - with the help of jellyfish .
Charlie Francis , the fluorescent properties of marine life and created a luminous infinity .
The idea came to him after he had read a research study on jellyfish and Chinese scientists could convince the protein artificially .
The ice cream eating reacts with the tongue , thus raising the pH of the protein and the lights .
Chris said , the ice cream would agree to the heat in the mouth and lights - the more you licks , the brighter it will .
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company `` Lick Me I 'm Delicious , '' says : `` The product is unbelievable , but it is still at a very early stage of production , and so you get two grams for 200 pounds . ''
The ice cream protein reacts with the tongue in a neutral pH .
If the mouth of the protein , the pH and the ice .
We have tested it in the last few months , and it seemed to us to be perfect , on Halloween , because it has this wonderful Leuchteffekt .
It is probably the most expensive ice cream , which I have ever produced , because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold .
Every ball cost me about 140 pounds .
But it tastes delicious .
Char read experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .
But his latest creation should be more ambitious .
He says : `` I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ''

NSA-Enthüllungen strengthen corporate paranoia because of state control
On a mild day at the end of August , a German flew low over the new United States Embassy in Frankfurt am Main , Germany 's financial capital .
On the instructions of the Federal Office for intelligence and counter-terrorism ( BAT ) , the German secret service inside , he should take the roof of the US-Außenpostens , less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .
According to German media wanted the crown to prove the existence of monitoring antennas and the action has led to an exchange of words between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .
James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , was once again in September that the United States has no possibility of foreign espionage , `` the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies to steal their international competitiveness or increase their profits . ''
But since , the whistleblowers that the former employees , with the publication of his filling Horn of US surveillance secrets has started , European governments and employers are no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word .
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and data of US cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have acquired the corporate paranoia because of state supervision to a new record .
The last straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel 's phone was verwanzt , possibly for ten years .
When the most powerful person in Europe targeted , managements are also potential targets .
No , the intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies made transparent .
I think that it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit .
`` Germany needs to wake up , '' says Oliver Green , President of BITMi , the small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .
German companies believe that the United States was now an almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey in July , which was published by the consultancy firm EY .
In the documents leaked by Snowden , however , there has been no evidence so far that the United States is the trade secrets of foreign companies on their own companies .
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet options and they reduce their dependence on the United States .
The companies are sceptical .
In parliament , it has been proposed that we should build a German Google .
I can close my eyes and open them again ...
`` That is not how things work , '' said Hasso Plattner , SAP chairman of the German software .

Tourism : Descent to the Romans
Around 120 metres from a sewer below is from the Roman era .
Cologne , who visited the cathedral is not over .
Some 157 metres , the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest building in Europe .
But only a few visitors who visit the two ornate church spires , knowing that it was also under the cathedral is a lot of things to discover .
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld .
Meeting point for his tours is the service Centre of Köln-Tourismus directly at the Cathedral .
The tour starts quite unspectacular : `` We are in the garage , '' says Schulze .
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a car fair city , and therefore of the remains of the ancient city walls only , which is not too large .
Most users of the multi-storey car park today , therefore , come to the Roman ruins and represent only their car .
But if you take a closer look , discovered in the parking deck D2 separated by metal iron bars archeological site .
To see about five metres high ruins from simple stones .
`` There are remains of Roman wall in the second half of the first century after Christ was built , '' says Schulze .
Before it goes back to light , Schulze participants on the upper level is still a glimpse into a dark , 15 metres deep shaft .
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is scarcely noticed .
Next stop of the tour is the Prätorium , and here the participants get back down into the depths .
What we have here is the office of the once powerful man north of the Alps , of the CCAA Prätors .
What CCAA means a visitor would like to know .
`` The acronym stands for '' Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium ' , which in plain English as much as `` town of Roman law and city of Agrippinenser , founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the Emperor 's cult '' means. ``
And the Prätorium is the former governors Palace , the power of the Roman empire on the Rhine .
From the foyer of the exhibition , a tunnel entrance to the Roman sewer , here at around 120 metres .
`` You can calmly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima , if you want , '' encouraging Schulze guests .
A surprise , Schulze .
After he left the keys at the box office , the group he leads to a 16 meters deep , walk-in shaft .
`` We are now in the mikvah , the ritual Jewish bath , '' he says .
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the soil , groundwater , which was essential for the ritual washing .
Up to now , the lower end of the mikvah , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine .
The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square , for which the construction work would begin soon .

Children should myths and legends as `` role models for life '' teach , says the author .
The stories of Thor showed that `` brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , '' and the Arthur demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .
However , many of the myths are `` far too wild , offensive and , in some cases , dirty , in order to be taught in schools , '' why Crossley-Holland for a `` careful selection '' age works .
`` I think it is wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education , '' he said .
I have already proposed a plan for twenty years .
He added , with authors and teachers who are `` overly didactic , '' `` children would '' shut down completely , `` because in entertaining stories , the messages '' subliminal .
Crossley-Holland , translated from the Anglo-Saxon poem , and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , said : `` You can pursue certain intentions , but it should be possible to keep in the background . ''
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults , and an author who writes for children , is the need to give hope .
Not everything needs to be simplified and the happy ending , but there is an inherent sense of good and evil .
This must be presented subliminally through the history and not be revealed .
It is the old story of the showing rather than telling .

A cry of despair Obama-Wählers
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has the laudable efforts of the blocking tactics by Republicans had been thwarted
The policy does not apologise Website-Probleme of blood , the drone attacks
Obama 's memoir on the election campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School .
I read a terribly sad book .
It is a book of which I have believed that it would be sad to me during the second year of my medical degree wit and give me hope .
It is called `` The Audacity to Win '' ( courage ) and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election .
In the evening , when I finished with my patients record and go to bed , then this book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and speeches will take your breath away .
The election was a landslide and for adults , spokesman for the historic importance of this moment .
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers .
A young team of visionaries was on her way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .
When Obama went into office in 2008 , he had approval values of 82 % .
And then I close the book .
Switch back to the present is a rude awakening , as if from a dream .
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
In the years since I made my voice for the first time , really has changed .
But it 's just not what I imagined .
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved by the adoption of the burden for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .
I , too , am of the opinion that the political block too many efforts have overturned , with which our nation forward : Immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay , to name just a few .
But after countless times the Obama administration to colleagues and friends , I am trying my statement at the end .
I have reached a point of political desperation .
The Republican blocking tactics can not explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .
It does not explain why the National Security Agency data about the private lives of Americans collect and why whistleblowers should be punished , disclose wrongdoing .
It does not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was killed without trial , nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections .
It does not justify the findings of a report , which states that the efforts of the White House to keep the media are the `` most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration . ''
And did it can not excuse the failure , in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act to create a simple Web site .
I do not know whether this is what I would have expected .
If I had to understand that the government of the previous political campaigns could disagree .
Obviously , the Abgeordnetenamt no predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown-Massaker shape the public debate .
But when I look at the above examples , then they seem largely by the government itself to be elected .
And that bothers me the most .
I have chosen Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative , he seemed to define its direction and positions .
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have heard for so long .
But with a decline in the ratings for Obama to below 45 % this week is a return to 2008 through this book to become even harder .
It makes me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air .
This week I read a section in the book , which describes how Obama a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania .
In a meeting with the electoral agents after the decision , he told his staff , they have to come back on track and the purpose of their cause .
`` I want us to find the magic , '' he said .
We have to remember who we are .
There are five years later , Mr. President , and I could not agree with you more .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris .

I can assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected .
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA is a force for good and its surveillance operations had been saved many lives .
He added : `` We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up . ''
There is a radical extremism in the world , which is determined to kill people , in the attack and governments .
So what would happen if we would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens ?
We have , in fact , plane crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we know in advance of such plans .

Furthermore , I am going to Europe , in order to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the NSA-Programme .
Media reports that the NSA millions of telephone data in Europe , relations with some US-Verbündeten , although the head of the secret service this week said that the reports were unfounded and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by ally with the United States had been exchanged .

Live with good prospects
Waltraud Ries is fantastic .
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old trees , nice neighbours , and not too much traffic .
In the city , there are only a few minutes by public transportation .
`` I hope you have no fear of spiders ? '' Asks Waltraud Ries and shows a big spider at the door .
I 'm looking for some time , a new apartment for my husband and me .
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .
The reason is , however , no spider phobia , but the concern , at the age of the many steps to the house and in the apartment is no longer able to cope , she says .
In addition , since one of the fifty Erin Meniskus-Operation has experienced what it means to deal with a handicap from floor to floor .
Recently she published a book on the subject of 'the tender age - What living form is the best for me ? ' .
`` Our apartment is the best example of what the age is not the issue , it begins to tell .
As more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
Today , with the middle 50 Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise .
You also know that it is one of the few people who could , with the theme 'living in old age ' .
Most of the crowd out there , as long as it is .
Old only the other ' , says she humorous .
Only when the suffering is really great , we will do .
`` Then it may be too late , '' ' .
In her book , the interior designer 17 living models for a self-determined housing in old age .
'What living form you choose , however , is always an individual decision , `` she explains .
D i e solution , it does not give the age .
Even if the residency in Tuscany or Brittany could afford should always consider that he could be ill .
And : 'Without a good knowledge of the language of the club is also playing in the Dolce Vita , `` the specialist book author relocation candidates in mind .
Under their models are classic care models , alternative forms of housing , or the often quoted Rentner-WG .
In old age , everyone has his tics and quirks
'For me would be nothing but a residents ' , says with a wink .
Certainly not like in a student house with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
`` At the age you just need his retreat , '' says Ries .
A senior living community can still work , the author , however , can not be ruled out .
But then it differently than in the classic Studenten-WG .
And sometimes you just want to only his rest ' , she believes .
With this view , at least in the capital , it is not alone .
`` Most old people want in Stuttgart , as long as it is in their own home , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the civil service life in the age of the provincial capital .
The department advises people around the theme of 'age ' .
Therefore , especially elderly people would often inconveniences and restrictions , just to stay in their familiar surroundings , this is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest .
There are many possibilities , the house or apartment buildings .
Ries recommends all who deal with age appropriate rebuilding their house or apartment , only to be properly informed and not the best craftsmen .
Today , there is also the age appropriate restructuring specialists .
Even in the apartment is one or the other , and if it is only increasing the toilet seat , clarifies the interior designer .
But not always , the existing apartment age and thus transform accessible , even if they are so beautiful .
This experience was Waltraud Ries .
Although we could install a chair inside the apartment , with stairs paved path to the front door but it would be a much bigger obstacle .
It will proceed to the ideal property for herself and her husband .
Before the move horrified her more than before the spider on her front door .

However , we are always interested in developments in regulations , which will benefit passengers , and the FAA decision and the reasons behind this certainly is .
The decision is in US airlines vary depending on the age of the fleet .
They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , hand baggage and customer guidance change .
`` After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of their fleet , it is easier for passengers using portable electronic devices such as tablets , E-Book-Lesegeräte and smartphones allow at every level , '' the FAA .
In rare cases , poor visibility will instruct the passengers , the crew during the landing off the devices .
The group also recommended that heavier devices during takeoff and landing safely under the seat or in the seats .

Egypt 's first freely elected president sworn in
Mohamed Morsi will be sworn in , but the triumph of the day may not be the end of political disputes in Egypt .
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a `` new Egypt '' as he became the first freely elected president of the country has been sworn in and the succession of Latvian , the 16 months earlier had been driven out of office .
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi was also the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world , and Egypt 's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
He presented the oath before the 18 dressed in black robes , the judges of the court , which has its headquarters on the Nile and an ancient Egyptian temple .
`` We aspire to a better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second republic , '' Morsi said at the ceremony , which was broadcast live on state television .
`` Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , '' said Morsi , 60 years in the United States , a trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its founding in 84 years mostly as a banned organisation of the respective government sharply had been targeted .
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building , as Morsi shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small car convoy arrived .
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court , the new president zuzujubeln , and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak era , the traffic was stopped for a short time , so that the car convoy was able to cross the busy street in the city centre , with the southern suburbs .
As uncharismatisches `` spare '' the Brotherhood derided his personal prestige since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he not only as a candidate of the Islamists , but all those who presented the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to your destination .
`` Egypt is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , '' said in a blue suit with a red tie Morsi dressed the judges in the wood-panelled chamber , in which he was sworn in .
Later , Morsi went to the University of Cairo , where he should keep his inaugural speech .
He was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem , which he listened in Habachtstellung .
The military 's Field was present .
On his arrival , he was of hundreds of people in the main auditorium of the university with a chant of `` The army and the people are one hand . ''
In 1908 as a bastion of secular education , University of Cairo , built in the 1970s , has become a stronghold of Islamist groups of students .
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in the Tahir-Platz , the birthplace of the uprising last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers , by the turn of the head of state .
But with the passing of the official oath before the court and not , rather than before Parliament as is customary , he is bowing to the wishes of the military , which shows that the power struggle will continue .
The speech at the Tahir-Platz was full of dramatic populist gestures .

Obama 's climbdown in health policy
After intense criticism , President Obama yesterday backed down in his oft-repeated , clear promises : `` If you like your insurance , you can keep it . ''
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of resignation , Republicans cast the president in recent days that he had misled the American public .
Yesterday , Obama watered down his original promise .
`` The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it , '' he said in a speech in Boston .
In response to the numerous media reports about the dismissals Obama called for those Americans who have received such messages , on the open market for a new insurance .
The majority of citizens could be a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than anticipated .
`` You get a better offer , '' he said .
The government called it a little surprising that the five percent of the population , who themselves have an insurance , should look for another rate , since the Treaty does not meet the new standards after the Affordable Care Act .
`` I would like to say directly to these Americans : You deserve better , '' Sebelius said at a hearing before the energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington .
Sebelius , the burden for the implementation of the Act is responsible , said that the launch of the online platform since October `` abysmal '' pariah .

ESA decides on major space missions : Missions for billions
Distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years .
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .
Distant worlds .
More than 1,000 planets in other stars , astronomers have already been found .
Whether there is life on at least some of them , nobody knows .
The selection is difficult : Should we search for gravitational waves ?
Or do you prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos ?
Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life ?
These questions are the leaders of the European Space Agency ( Esa .
For its program `` Cosmic Vision '' looking for ideas for two major space projects , the research is crucial .
The budget for such `` L-Missionen '' is about a billion euros .
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
At the beginning of September , met in Paris , the elite of the European space research , in order to discuss proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were on the table , five of them are now in the final round .
Many bodies to examine the proposals , tick the researchers .
In the next few days , a final decision by the scientific program committee .
A total of four major issues has selected the Esa , to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated `` Cosmic Vision '' to find answers .
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life ?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that orbit stars - are still in the proverbial dark .
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .
And if a star planet , under what circumstances can create life ?
To investigate this question , the space telescope in 2017 , `` unlike '' to start , with the 500 already known planetary systems in our area to be examined in detail .
But the opportunities are limited , Khufu is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .
With larger instruments astronomers could step planet and analyse the composition of their atmospheres and search for `` biomarkers '' : Gases , as an indicator for biological activity .
How does the solar system ?
This question is , ultimately , what conditions for the emergence of life .
Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from him with the star .
In our solar system are examples of these events .
The Solar Orbiter `` the Esa is already a mission of the series ( this is where the budget at around half a billion euros ) for this question .
The probe is going to start in 2017 and finish and activity of the sun .
Of great interest to researchers are also Jupiter and its moons .
You want to find out what the role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system .
This is the Esa is the first of the three L-Missionen of `` cosmic vision '' programme .
The probe `` juice '' ( Jupiter Icy moons Explorer ) begins its journey to 2022 .
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa and Ganymede , wiser .
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe ?
The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws we know there are still valid .
Perhaps the physicists , the path to a new theory could indicate that comprises all known laws of nature .
What is the universe and what is it ?
In our universe 13.7 billion years from the Big Bang .
In addition to the daily material from which stars , planets and life as we are , there are dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters , and dark energy , which is speeding up the expansion of the universe .
So far , the researchers do not know what physical laws in the first fractions of a valid from the Big Bang , nor what dark matter , dark energy .
With `` Euclid , '' the Esa also has already approved a M-Mission , whose launch is scheduled for 2020 .
With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky , investigate and provide information on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .
Who could make this race
Of the 30 proposals at the end of the selection process , only two remain .
The best chance of a Bewilligung as L-mission , according to many experts `` E-Lisa , '' an ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves .
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time , the Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
It has not been proven .
Elisa could hope to achieve this , the scientists behind the project .
The mission is one of two or three probes existing detector , which is deployed in space .
It could , in contrast to sites around the world , evidence of gravitational waves , which are the Big Bang , and new insights into the origin of the cosmos .
Four other proposals still compete for the second L-mission : A large X-ray telescope named `` Athena , '' which will explore , among other things , would investigate black holes , `` Icy Planets , '' another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , `` Prism , '' a mission to survey the cosmic radiation , and the `` Exoplanet Finder , '' the first step is to identify and investigate the planet .
Among other proposals are already resigned to Proben-Rücktransport from Mars , for the study of the moon , Venus and Earth and the solar physics .

Currently , passengers need to smartphones , tablets and other devices , when the doors are closed .
You may then start again , when the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain has given the green light .
When entering the final approach , passengers need to disable them and they are not allowed to start again , before the plane landed .
According to the new guidelines could airlines whose aircraft against electronic malfunctions were secured to allow their passengers , the devices during take-off , landing and on the tarmac , the FAA said .
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi in greater heights have been converted , should meet the criteria .
Laura Glading , president of the Association of professional cabin crew , welcomed the changes .
`` If the new regulation will be implemented - and in this regard , we are working closely together with the airline , will benefit both sides , '' said Glading .
We are tired of it , to be honest , we feel on this issue as a watchdog .
However , Internet surfing , exchange of e-mails , text messages or downloading data at three kilometres , explained the authority .
Passengers are asked to smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
Still no `` Words With Friends , '' which recalls the Scrabble online game , the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he was a high profile of American Airlines jet had to leave because he refused to turn off the device , while the plane was parked at the gate .
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stowed , because there is a risk of injury if they are flying through the cabin .
Mobile phone calls during the flight is also still remain banned .
The regulatory competence for calls for the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .
FAA sets may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
Last month , said Mark Rosenker of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board , security expert for national transport on CBS News , mobile phones are still regarded as a risk .
`` Mobile is really a problem , not only because they potentially could cause disruptions in GPS system , but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air also can interfere with radio masts , '' Rosenker .
The industry an Advisory Committee , which the FAA to investigate this issue was launched last month , recommended that the government to allow wider use of personal electronic devices .
In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA , restrictions on its use .
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri , take the view that there is no valid reasons for the ban .
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous .
In some studies , says that up to a third of the passengers of the closure of the unit forgotten or ignored .
The FAA began in 1966 , the use of electronic devices by passengers , after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices of passengers UKW-Radios agencies had become known , at the time , the latest technology trends .
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they represent anything electronic interference .
Airlines offer passengers for a number of years ago , when the ground is achieved .
The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference .
The vast majority of passenger aircraft for the greater use of electronic devices will be suitable for the new directives , Huerta said .
Today 's electronic devices , in general , much less phone radiation than previous generations .
For example , only minimal radiation if umblättert .
However , when downloading or sending data transfer values .
Among the supporters of a loosening of restrictions on the use by passengers is Amazon.com .
2011 invited employee airliner full of Kindle rumours and made a test flight in order to identify problems , but could not say .
Members of the FAA-Beratungskomitees expressed mixed feelings about what the risk involved in the use of devices .
Douglas Kidd from the passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the view that the disruption of the equipment is real , even if the risk is minimal .
Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .
However , the committee recommended that the FAA , the pilots to land in poor visibility conditions for instruments of the closure of units by the passengers .
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes , describing it as a reasonable accommodation for travellers who extensively with technology today .
`` We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a passenger experience is not in contradiction with the security , '' said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .

But Chen later on television that he had accepted bribes to reports of a state company .
Now the New Express will be a `` comprehensive Rektifizierung , the regulator said .
The `` Rektifizierunganordnung '' came from the authority for press and publications , radio , film and television in Guangdong .
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , Yang Cheng Evening News Group , between September 2012 and August 2013 several inaccurate reports of the publicly traded company Zoom Lion .

Early puberty : Grow up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be rather than their white age mates , studies show .
Physical changes mean not directly puberty
There is no evidence that hormones and other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN-Korrespondentin Pat Etheridge is a journalist who has specialised in child health and family issues .
A mother should be concerned when her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair ?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics pediatricians Association this week in Orlando , Florida , said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal under American girls and a new standard .
`` I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - usually there is no indication that quickly puberty occurs , '' explained Kaplowitz .
Obvious indicators of development , such as growing breasts , Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor , show up in girls .
However , there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche ( first menstruation ) in the last 40 years .
In the United States , the average age for 12.5 years , slightly less than visual in 1970 .
`` If the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to Menarche , '' said Kaplowitz , author of the book `` early puberty in girls : The essential guide to dealing with this often occurs . ''
Time is the most accurate test , such as puberty .
It is controversial , which is actually the start of puberty , but `` precocious '' if the breast of a growth spurt before the age of eight years .
In most cases , the process is slowed down or stagnating - something that a doctor can monitor closely .
For faster progress could be displayed by a Endikronologen tests , so that serious problems such as cysts or tumors can be excluded .
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence : The early aging of the bones , the strong growth inhibition and small stature in adults .
The recommendations for a medication or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and the emotional maturity .
Psychosocial aspects are also important .
Kaplowitz is sceptical about drugs , but he admits : `` The suppression of puberty can conduct problems and mitigate the feelings of girls , unlike their age mates . ''
The other major problem is understandable : Parents would simply not that their very young daughters of the period .
`` They are concerned because of the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side , '' said Kaplowitz .
`` It was a shock , '' recalls one woman whose daughter with ten of their days .
Even if there were signs and we had spoken about menstruation , she was not prepared for it emotionally .
She was scared and excited home from school , because it was the first in her group of friends .
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be eliminated .
Young girls are similar to early puberty .
Kaplowitz is of the opinion that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .
He was conducting a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years , which is a connection between body fat and entering puberty .
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .
In this country tend to African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty earlier than their white age mates .
There are various explanations for this .
Global seems an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions on the climate to the genes .
Another mystery : Although boys face and pubic hair grows earlier , the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .
Other doctors on the AAP-Konferenz underscored the complexity of the issue .
The emergence of acne and pubic hair is even in infants and young children .
`` We have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , '' said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .
Parents should not hesitate to advice from their doctor , how they should talk with their child .
`` It may mean that you can carry on a conversation earlier than expected , '' advised Kaplowitz .
If you remain calm , the child is usually good .
Girls , early bloom , need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it happens earlier than expected .

Profit at Bombardier after decline in deliveries and orders to pay
The Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported on Thursday a 15-prozentigen fall in net profit , after declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter , as well as contract problems in the railway sector was under pressure .
Bombardier , based in Montreal , no flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the plane , according to the ambitious timetable next September could go into commercial use .
On the maiden flight of the test aircraft from one and a half months followed so far , only three more launches what it seems questionable whether the trial as planned .
The results were behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent of the Stock Exchange of Toronto .
Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , on Thursday lowered its rating from `` outperform '' to `` sector perform '' in view of the fact that the stock in the next one or two quarters of a limited course potential .
`` The weaker suppliers have been charged with aircraft as expected , but the margin development in the transport sector , we are clearly disappointed , '' Doerksen said in a client .
We believe that new orders for Bombardier CSeries , if the testing program for the plane .
However , if in the coming months will be announced no new orders , then we expect that the market will be sceptical about the programme .
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft the company can catapult into the lower segment , which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .
The first test plane was presented to the public in March , after months of delays and flew for the first time in September .
But so far , binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flights and want to see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft is correct .
Currently , there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier his goal of 300 firm orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets will achieve .
The company said on Thursday with analysts and the media , the program is on schedule .
`` The test aircraft remained on the ground is no longer than expected , '' said Beaudoin during a conference call and added , while the service life of the aircraft had been scheduled ground testing and software updates .
Each manufacturer is planning .
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period , which is what we have done .
This is happening during the entire flight programme .
The second of five test planes will be expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it was said by the company .
However , analysts remain sceptical about whether 12 months after the maiden flight of the first customer for the CSeries aircraft in operation .
Bombardier said that it check the planning for the operation ( EIS ) and will update this in the next few months .
`` The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 is shifting , '' Doerksen said .
In the third quarter with Bombardiers end on September 30 , net income fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .
The adjusted earnings per share of 9 cents , unchanged .
Sales slipped slightly after and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars .
Analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $ 4,56 million expected , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S .
The world 's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decrease of 57 last year .
Net orders fell by 83 aircraft at 26 .
The order book in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on September 30 and was unchanged compared with December 31 .
`` In the field of aerospace , the results in the context of our targets , but the low order intake and the market as a whole were disappointing , '' said Beaudoin .
Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars .
Bombardier , the world 's biggest train manufacturer , announced that sales in this division by nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
The order book in the transport sector , on 30 September , amounted to $ 32.6 billion , compared with December 31 , slightly increased .
The profit margin in the field of transport , handling problems in a number of large contracts .
According to corporate governance , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .
In afternoon trading on Thursday announced the Bombardier-Aktie at 8.5 percent and totaled 4,83 Canadian dollars , after it was announced that the Google-Finanzvorstand Patrick Pichette will switch to the board .
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world 's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardiers closest rival , on Thursday reported a 10 % fall in quarterly profits .

`` In campaigns is not so much money spent on surveys and focus groups , if we do not seriously thinking about something , '' said Martin on AC360 .
However , it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team on an exchange .
Martin said on CNN that he had Daley asked whether his former boss on the potential change knowledge .
Although Daley said that he does not believe that the president was aware of the possible change ' , `` the former chief of staff , it was '' possible `` that Obama was aware of them .
Martin added that `` Double Down '' no definitive answer to the question of whether the artificial political soundings had reached Obama 's desk .
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously think Obama knew nothing of the investigation about whether Biden should fall in the elections .

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will for the first time on February 22 new cardinals of the Catholic Church , the Vatican announced on Thursday .
Cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic Church after Pope and they are the ones who choose a pope , Francis to appoint the first group of men , which will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor .
Currently there are 201 cardinals .
However , a cardinal who reached the age of 80 years ago , is no longer take part in the papal election - this is a group of 120 `` eligible cardinals . ''
In a statement , in which the news was announced , said Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman for the Vatican , there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony on the appointment of the new cardinals will be held , also known as a consistory .
`` Pope Francis has decided that its decision to convene the children in February to announce in advance , so that other meetings , the participation of the cardinals from around the world , can be planned , '' said Lombardi .
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices , said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably be dropped until February .
He said that a pope those normally so many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of eligible cardinals 120 measured again , and so many cardinals over 80 , as he would like .
The consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , Valero .
There are currently some overhang on the part of Europe , especially Italy .
`` It will be interesting to see whether the new pope cardinals from the rest of the world will appoint to restore the balance , '' he said .
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
The Cardinals will also be the first since the formation of the Council of Cardinals , founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from around the world , responsible ways to reform the church .
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .
`` Now that Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him , '' said Valero .
He said that it was `` quite possible '' that the Cardinals Francis for advice .
But so far we have not been in this situation - this is all very new .
Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to cardinals were appointed , but Francis is `` full of surprises , so we do not know who he appoints . ''

The situation has scarcely changed since Bwelles father died in 2002 .
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organisation .
In contrast , the ratio in the United States with a doctor for 413 people .
But even if there were a doctor for them , most Cameroonians visiting .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three quarters of health spending in the country are private .
`` The only problem they have is poverty , '' says Bwelle .
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
His father , and so many of his countrymen are allowed to ripen Bwelle decided to do something about it .
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team last year 700 free operations carried out .
He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .
In addition , he founded a nonprofit organization called ASCO Vime who travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care .
Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people .
He squeezed almost every Friday and up to 30 people in minibuses and proceed with the verschnürten medical equipment on the roof over unbefestigtes terrain in the villages that need help .
Everything is not always smooth .
More than once they had the vehicles through rivers and mud .
But when they arrive , they will be welcomed as heroes : A banquet , singing and dancing and the best accommodation , the place has to offer .
In these villages is free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with its broad smile and his boundless energy - is the joyful celebration .
The next morning , the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of patients .
`` We are dealing with 500 people per ride , '' Bwelle .
You come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village - and on foot .
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
Many people are due to malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .
Others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for the school , but many poor families simply can not afford .
In the evening , the team simple operations with local anesthesia .
The operations are normally in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the surgery , the patient and go in the relaxation area , in order to make room for the next .
The illumination of the OP and disinfection equipment is powered by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and its volunteers work until the early hours on Sunday .
It is a demanding job , but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .
`` They drum all night to stay awake and so that we can continue our work , '' says Bwelle .
On Sunday , the team goes back into the city , tired , but proud of the work that has been done .
The group - a mix of Cameroonian doctors and medical students - in the past year has 700 free operations carried out and know that their work is an enormous difference for the people , which helps .
A man explained that the free operation of a ' , which he received now allows him to return to work .
`` The change the future of my family , '' said the man .
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital at night Bwelle works in private clinics in Yaoundé .
With this second job , he financed 60 % of its charitable activities , Bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .
`` I really do not know when he sleeps , '' says Katie O'Malley , in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group .
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization , so that he can go to these campaigns .
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley , who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle , this is an opportunity to gather practical experience that they would never get at home .
`` We can be in operations , where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle , '' says O'Malley .
This would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible .
The students typically pay for their trip to Cameroon and often donated medical material .
But they are only once in Yaoundé , Bwelle accommodation , transport and guide .
`` He is without doubt a hero , '' says O'Malley .
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon , knows no bounds .
For Bwelle is the almost constant work , not a burden .
The other to a happier life , and in order to fulfil a promise that he has given to his father gives him great joy .
`` I 'm so happy if I make this work , '' says Bwelle .
And I think of my father .
I hope he sees what I do .
I do it in order to bring people back to laugh and to relieve pain .

In the last two years , I have not , from my apartment to distribute sweets , and will not do so again this year .
But , according to the statistics , I am a black sheep , and Halloween .
The majority of Americans - 158 million , to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year , and a total of $ 6.9 billion for candy , costumes and decorations , the American Association of retailers ( industry ) .
One thing on which I am , then every Halloween , the trend values .

This year , the provocative Kinsey .
Women must no longer remain in sexy clothes , they can now also tempting food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
What men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies , thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk-Weltraummänner will create the Instagram-Feeds this year .
According to Google , the most sought-after costumes zombies , witches and pirates .
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
Last year , we had our dogs and to my astonishment is not alone .
In fact , Americans 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their pets , so the industry .
There are a lot of `` Hot Dogs . ''
What candy is concerned , we are not squeamish .

About 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars , lollipops , candy and gum .
So , good news for the Department to 41 million people , with the slogan `` trick or treating '' through the quarter .

The only thing we do not want to consume , the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; nevertheless , 15 million kilograms of them sold for Halloween , according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturer .
About nine billion grains of corn .
It is a mystery that I still could not solve .
Nothing is more on Halloween than houses where there are haunting .
You have great names like `` Terror Behind the Walls '' ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , `` Howl-O-Scream '' and `` The House of Shock . ''
There are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States , the 500 million dollar proceeds , America , and that includes the wonderful photos , on which we are in the Commons and then friends on Facebook , where you do not get rid of them again , and then the guy that , a comment like `` nice facial expression .

The Council is targeting tracks
The railway crossing `` Am Hirschen '' expenditure , in order to improve road safety ?
Yes , the local councillors have decided .
Schiltach must EUR 220 000 .
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal-Bahnstrecke in the coming year .
In particular the safety at level crossings be increased - it is regularly nationwide to collisions between trains with other vehicles .
The transformed into communities , they have to deal with a third of the cost , and the rest are divided .
Schiltachs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the peculiarities of the Bahübergangs `` Am Hirschen . ''
There is the city , in the amount of the tunnel mouth , west of the railway tracks to build a bulge .
There could also be more vehicles , for example , those who transported long timber at oncoming traffic , without having to block the tracks .
Grießhaber proposed , to construct a retaining wall so that the city of the subsequent street could expand at the appropriate time , in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow .
This was discussed in the council is controversial , since some councils need roads were spreading in doubt : Thomas tilt , saying the mood of the critics : `` Because we have so few cars so much money ? ''
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed : The railway crossing Hirschen will regularly used for long wood shipments .
Even wood from the area `` Kuhbach '' will be transported via this route , in part because the vehicles of up to 20 metres long the route could use the Häberlesbrücke not because they could not turn in the road .
In addition , the track served as a diversion for those vehicles which are not allowed to use the tunnel , if the road is blocked , Haas .
As expected , that church and castle mountain tunnel rebuilt and refurbished , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway crossing `` Am Hirschen for a longer period is an important traffic significance .
The Council agreed to investigate the costs of the proposed expansion of the street .
Despite this , the reconstruction of the railway crossing largely agreed with the proviso that the retaining wall will be built in such a way that the city of the subsequent road `` Bahnhofstrasse '' possibly for meeting traffic at around 5.5 m building .
The railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein , on the other hand , could be a quite different problem , which the access in the rising `` Geroltzhäuser way ' .
The administration had the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering study Breinlinger , because they had doubts about whether the planned end of Geroltzhäuser route will still be possible without further ado .
The study concluded that can not be ruled out that the conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles .
The responsibility for carrying the city as a road last winner .
Therefore , could the restructuring liability disputes .
Since both the collection and the turning in the current state of development should be worked , the reconstruction of the railway crossing , Henman argued .
Also at this point is the risk of a collision with a car on the transition are significantly lower than in the other rail crossings , because the next stop in the middle , a good sight .
Even trains from the main railway station , this would have to be slowed down so far that there is no danger of a collision .
Mostly , the reconstruction of this railway crossing denied the agreement , since the city Schiltach , the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles `` should suffer the consequences , '' according to the councils , as the train after the completion of the construction could withdraw from the responsibility .
The body is seen as the changes on the level crossings `` Before running '' and `` Before Kuhbach , '' for the intersection of agreements with the train .

Howells said : `` The whole audience was hooked and everyone cheered and applauded him . ''
He was running on sand , the entire length of the arena , and although he looked so tiny , he has done a fantastic job .
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens , which he cares .
As it is launched , it will not be long before he is on the `` horse of the year '' -Schau - and I am sure he will do well .

Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457-Visumsinhaber , after the company in the past , only a small number of workers wanted to support , finally hundreds .

Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of major orders up
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , it is to be a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights , which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month .
The dispute revolves around the seat width , the passengers on long-haul flights in economy class is offered - not always those that most airlines , but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of allegations in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .
Airbus this week called for an industry standard , a minimum width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the economy , but the American competetive Boeing says airlines should decide .
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft are vying to even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range aircraft to sell , and the event from 17 to 21 November record orders .
As the rear part of the aircraft is fleshed out - especially if it ranks with nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results , the new Mini Jumbo `` design to deliver .
Boeing said that its new `` 777X '' shall be 406 people in economy class seats , which are about 17 inches wide and ten per series .
Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 car 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in economy class , and there are nine per series .
Share aircraft giants often blows on technical details via advertising in the press .
Now , Airbus calls before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race , directly to the public .
Recently , the company unveiled an ad , which is the beginning of a new ad war could and donors a picture , in which three people squeezed in a restaurant , and the title : `` Would you accept that ? ''
`` Boeing is proposing long haul flights in seats that are more closely than regional Turbo-Props , '' said Airbus sales chief John Leahy .
In light of changed eating habits will people be thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 % , so the data of the US-Gesundheitsministeriums .
The Taillenumfang of the male average American in the 21st century , according to US health statistics 100,8 cm .
Airbus says that his rival to a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of newly baptized `` Jet Set '' narrow .
We have , as Airbus , investigations showed that an extra inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat by 53 percent raises the sleep quality .
Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus to the seat sizes and says that it is not up to the manufacturer to decide how the balance between airlines and air fares .
The company also said , according to surveys , the experience in the plane for more than the minimum width .
`` It is really to airlines to provide flexibility , so that they can do what they believe they need to be successful , '' explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing .
You do not want to dictate to them what they are .
They know their business better than anyone else .
For passengers , it 's about more elbow for manufacturers , but it is increasingly an issue that can impact on the sales .
The debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion dollars at catalogue prices in the coming decades , as heavily on the export performance of the United States or Europe .
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , is the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets .
Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficient per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment , the 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER .
The statements by Boeing on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X , with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
The increased cost per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row .
`` Boeing squeezes more seats on his plane , in order to make our products more competitive , '' says Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus .
On the other hand , say analysts , full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777 indicated that many passengers for closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares .
`` 18 inch seat width would be great for the passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer from the threat of the 777 controlled , '' says Mary Kirby , an expert on cabin no direction , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .
Airbus and Boeing have no seats , but a catalogue of suppliers , from which the airlines .
The world travelers Jet-Verkäufer carry tape measure , the creation of the competition and gherkins .
Even if they offer the comfort dressing , but all manufacturers also jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .
Airbus offers a A350 with ten rows of seats , but has not as yet .
Until recently , Airbus has emphasised the importance of greater adaptability of cabins and some Jets wide seats in the corridors .
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle , but from the wave of 777X-Verkäufen could distract .

Syria have facilities for the production of chemical weapons and Gitftgasmunition destroyed , explained the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday , while in the north of the country to heavy clashes near one of the sites , where suspected toxic substances are stored .
Also on Thursday , a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago had been killed .
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline
November 1 , the organisation based in The Hague , Damascus had set all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons to destroy or `` were , '' including all the machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions .
The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of the destruction , is an important milestone for an ambitious timetable , on the destruction of all Syria 's chemical weapons by the middle of 2014 .
The destruction of the institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
Damascus has yet to begin , however , the existing weapons and to destroy stockpiles .
Estimates suggest that there are in the country and about 1,000 tonnes of chemical weapons , including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin .
The announcement came at a time when fighting on Thursday took place in the town of Safira , experts say that there is a facility for chemical weapons production and storage facilities , such as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said .
The activist group , which has a network of activists in Syria , the number of deaths , said on Thursday , 120.296 people have died .
These are 6.365 61.067 civilians , including children .

On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of people killed in the conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .
This figure has not been updated .
The conflict has approximately two million people have been forced to flee the country .
Assad 's troops for weeks in Safira fight against the rebels , many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups .
The observatory said it voted on Thursday losses on both sides , but no details .
The fighting underscores the risk that are exposed to the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria 's toxic arsenal is a race against time in the middle of a brutal civil war .
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , is the team `` now convinced that all of these important production and mixing / filling equipment and has witnessed their destruction . ''
Therefore , `` are currently planned no further inspection activities . ''
At the beginning of the week , the inspectors said that they have completed the first round of checks and 21 out of 23 sites declared by Damascus .
Due to security concerns is the visit of two institutions would not have been possible , said the inspectors .
On Thursday , the OPWC , the two sites have been abandoned , according to the Syrian statement ... `` and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme have been relocated to other indicated bodies that have been inspected . ''
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions , which have not been able to visit the OPCW-Inspektoren .
Syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , the next month , the Executive Committee of the OPWC must be approved .
`` I salute the bravery and the courage that you all while fulfilling the most challenging mission that has ever been executed by this organisation , have shown , '' said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the OPCW monitoring organisation in a published commentary .
For three years , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels are fighting in the civil war against Assad 's government and its security forces , many members of the Alawites , a secession of Shia Islam .
In terms of further developments , said the head of the monitoring group , Rami Abdurrahman , it was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .

Gechingen : No absolute protection
`` We want the people to at an early stage in the planning , '' Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on flood protection concept in Gechingen .
About 80 participants in the town hall , in order to explain the measures planned to ask questions , to express concerns and ideas .
Häußler was clear : `` The final decisions of the members of the council . ''
The flooding that Gechingen on 15 May 2009 , unprepared , is a crucial event that the question of protection measures for the future , so Häußler .
A river with the neighboring far study was commissioned , the basis for the flood protection scheme in Gechingen .
`` The protection of as many cultivated land is the goal , '' says Häußler .
It is based on the design of the protection against a according to the German weather service statistically every 100 years to expected flooding .
Climate change is a 15 % surcharge .
So it is with `` HQ 100a climate . ''
The floods which Gechingen in 2009 had led to considerable damage , flooding with a 1,000 years .
`` There is not an absolute protection , but we can reach a relative improvement , '' says Häußler .
In order to achieve the climate protection HQ 100a Gechingen , must be invested approximately EUR 4 million , and the community with country shots to the tune of around 70 percent .
Häußler pointed out , however , that it is promoting only , if a master plan will be implemented .
This is the community relies on the cooperation of the citizens .
A large-scale planning and licensing procedures must be completed .
In the best case , 2016 can be started with the implementation .

Moreover , it is considered one of the most economical solution , Joachim forest of forest and Corbe .
There was resentment in countries bordering the Altorts , even in normal humans repeatedly under an overload of the canal network .
The problem is with the administration and the first steps have been taken .

Frontier Airlines charges for baggage
Frontier Airlines plans , up to 100 dollars from passengers who want to stow luggage on their flight .
Frontier Airlines intends , up to $ 100 for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or soda , even if in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers would keep the whole box .
The new charge will apply to bags in the overhead baggage compartment on the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .
Frontier said that establish 25 dollars , if the fee will be paid in advance , and $ 100 for passengers who pay at the gate .
Frontier-Sprecherin Kate O'Malley said the fee of $ 100 is introducing travelers to move to the payment in advance .
`` We want to calculate this sum , '' she said .
Airlines began in 2008 , for the first and second checked bag fees .
Passengers who tried to bypass it , have therefore filled in your hand luggage as much as possible , with the result that the baggage compartments above the headquarters are often full to overflowing .
Fees are a way to make passengers less on board .
O'Malley said the new fee is not really about money .
It was about the most loyal customers of Frontier , which have clearly stated that it will be increasingly difficult to place in the seat .
Passengers carrying your tickets on the website of the airline , do not have to pay for it .
This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier may be allowed to carry one bag for free , but the next person 100 dollars on a comparable piece .
O'Malley said that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed , so that passengers be informed about the fee before they come to the gate .
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only come into force in the summer , a precise date , there are not .
Rail passengers often on baggage fees and other charges , but airlines are like .
They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service , if they wanted it .
Many on Wall Street , the new baggage charges as a sign that the airlines have enough money , after years of losses to cover the cost of air travel .
So far , however , most of them the finger of charges for hand luggage .
Asked Spirit Airlines Inc. three years ago , the first to charge for hand luggage , and later followed all the Giant Air , a low-cost carriers .
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely followed the charges .
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit equals $ 50 million a year .
Sorensen , who previously held a senior position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flown with Spirit , and was curious as to what he would expect at the gate when passengers with the unusual hand baggage fee would be facing the company .
`` The boarding process was one of the most in my career , I have seen in the aviation industry , '' he said .
I expected , gnashing and of vehement debate at the gate .
`` The plane was full , '' he said , `` and the boarding ran into problems . ''
Frontier is Spirit in the $ 2 for coffee , tea , soda or juice .
The company said that passengers who bought soda or juice , would keep the whole tin and coffee refilled for free .
Water is still free .
In 2008 , US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks , but made it back seven months later , after passengers complained and no other big society was stroking .
Frontiers step to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline , is the latest initiative , with the customer focused on their own website .
Airlines pay for online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 dollars per ticket sold .
All of this gives companies an incentive for passengers to move directly to them rather than through an online travel Agency .
However , in this area , Frontier has gone furthest .
The company started in September , when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles .
On Wednesday , the miles again reduced to 25 percent of the flight .
In a third party booked a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles , therefore only 250 miles .
Passengers can also exclusively to the directly on the website of Frontier reservation .
Frontier has a loyal customer base with its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .
The proceeds were donated by 9 percent and the flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , as the financial report , on Wednesday of the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc. , has been released .
Republic has tried , within the framework of the sale of the company , the finances of Frontier .

Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder and first president of Mozambique , in a rare public demonstration of peace .
`` We want peace , we want stability , '' said Vanessa de Sousa , managing director of an investment company .
Out of fear for the future of the country , their business attire for a T-shirt with the inscription `` We want security '' in Portuguese and joined the crowd on the Independence Square in the capital on Thursday .
For two weeks , there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement , more than 20 years ago .
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in a bid to destabilize the country 's independent government .
After the peace treaty of 1992 , she became an opposition party .
Analysts consider it unlikely that zurueckfalle the country back into a full-scale conflict , but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals .
For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake , because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could in the next few years investments of more than $ 50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto , Vale of Brazil , Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States .
The ruling FRELIMO Party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo are blaming each other for the tensions .
RENAMO claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes , it could have on October 17 , its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional stronghold Renamos attacked .
The attacks on the former rebels escalated , when government troops attacked bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , leader of the group , said Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times .
The government is Renamo the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers .
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .
He told AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as `` losers '' who `` wants to use all its remaining forces to prove that the government can impose its decisions . ''
Both FRELIMO and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war .
But the concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was the 1992 peace agreement in .
He told the FT , he said that he had meant that FRELIMO no longer respect the agreement .
`` Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously , '' said Mazanga .
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year .
`` We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who heads collide , '' says Joseph Hanlon , a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions .
RENAMO , which is pressing for electoral reforms , has already declared that it will boycott the local elections in November .
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement , concessions and financial incentives from the government .
Renamos electoral success since 1992 , while a new party , headed by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in the elections .
Mazanga claimed that Guebuza , whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year , wants to destroy the country 's democracy .
`` He does not want a multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to give up the presidency , '' said .
It is unclear what capacity Renamo , but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south routes .
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala , which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo , Beira , but the port , mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal .
In June , Rio interrupted a month for the use of the railways , after Renamo had announced an attack on the track .
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat .
Renamo wanted to `` warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique , '' said Mazanga .
The instability has increased the frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , Head of Media Coop , an independent media company , because many people already worried about the corruption , the slow progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave of abduction .
`` People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems , '' he says .
Omar sultans , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .
`` Not FRELIMO and Renamo , they just want to restore peace and usable roads , '' he said .

Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders on seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , it is a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights , which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month .
The dispute revolves around the seat width , passengers on long flights in economy class - not always the most airlines , but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .
Airbus this week called for an industry standard , which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in economy class , but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should be decided by .
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes , and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record orders .
As the rear part of the aircraft , in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results indicated that , which is to deliver the new `` mini-jumbo '' design .
Boeing claims its modernized `` 777X '' take 406 people in seats in economy class , which are about 17 inches wide and ten per line .
Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 befördere 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class , there are nine per series .
Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertisements in the press .
Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race , directly to the public .
Recently , the company has an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and donors showed a picture , in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant , and the title : `` Would you accept that ? ''
`` Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo-prop aircraft , '' says Airbus sales chief John Leahy .
In the light of changed eating habits are thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel , and the end of the century , has the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 percent , the data from the US Health Ministry .
The Taillenumfang male average American is in the 21st century , according to US health statistics 100.8 cm .
Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of the newly baptized `` jet Set '' was narrow .
It was , as Airbus , that showed that an extra inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat , the quality of sleep by 53 percent .
Boeing disputes the figures Airbus to the seat and says it is not to decide at the discretion of the manufacturer , as airlines make the balance between air fares and furnishings .
The company also explains , according to the experience in the aircraft of more than the seat width .
`` It is really boils down to give airlines flexibility , so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , '' explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing .
You do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .
They know their business better than anyone else .
For passengers , there is more elbow , but for manufacturers , it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales .
Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which could have a major impact on the export performance of the US or Europe .
As Reuters reported in July for the first time , the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets .
Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment , the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER .
Boeing 's statements on the results depend in part on the the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row .
`` Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products , '' says Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus .
On the other hand , say analysts , full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers opted for closer alignment , which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares .
`` Eighteen inches of legroom would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view from the Airbus is controlled by the threat of the 777 , '' said Mary Kirby , an expert on cabin no direction , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats , but a catalogue of suppliers , from which the airlines can choose .
The world-travelling jet sellers even tape measure , the establishment of the competition .
Even if they extol the convenience , but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .
Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks , but has not yet been sold , according to its own account .
Until recently , Airbus has stressed the importance of greater adaptability of the cabin and offered for some jets wide seats in the corridors .
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle , but it could distract from the wave of 777X-sales .

NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a balmy day at the end of August , a German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main , Germany 's financial capital .
On the instructions of the Federal Office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism ( BAT ) , the German domestic intelligence service , he shoot the roof of the U.S. outpost , located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .
According to German media wanted the BAT antennas to prove the existence of surveillance and the action led to an exchange of words between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .
James Clapper , Director of National Intelligence , was again in September that the U.S. no possibilities of foreign espionage , `` in order to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies , so that they could strengthen their international competitiveness or their profits . ''
But since Edward Snowden , the whistleblower 's former employees , began with the publication of his US surveillance secrets , European governments and corporate executives no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word .
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and data acquired American cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought the company 's paranoia about government surveillance to a new peak .
The last straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel 's phone verwanzt , possibly for the last 10 years .
If the most powerful person in Europe , then certainly potential targets .
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies .
I think that it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit .
`` Germany needs to wake up , '' says Oliver Green , president of the BITMi , small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .
German companies believe that the United States now almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , according to a survey published in July by the consultancy firm EY .
In the documents leaked by Snowden , however , there has been no evidence so far that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies .
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities , and they should reduce their dependence on the United States .
The companies are sceptical .
The Bundestag has been suggested that we should build a German Google .
I can close my eyes and open them slowly ...
`` It does not work , '' says Hasso Plattner , chairman of the German software maker SAP .
If you had a strong European IT industry , then they should not have been 20 years ago .
Everything in Germany is subsidized by the coal on cars to agriculture .
Everything , except for the IT industry .
Nevertheless , the reach and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations shocked companies , which had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China .
The cloud computing is a big change , because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to the jurisdiction and are therefore potentially at risk .
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance , a trade body , the revelations about the US data mining activities with Prism about ten percent of the members of the United States plans to use an American supplier .
Jim Snabe , deputy CEO of SAP , says : `` We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago , it is : Where my data will be stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this area ? ''
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to steal their valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs .
That economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise .
This has always been the case .
`` It was an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion , '' says Kurt Bock , chairman of the chemical company BASF .
The Americans spy on commercial and industrial level , as we do that , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
The company does not normally on the , which affords attackers benefits .
In large companies , employees have long eingebläut that take away a free USB sticks at a trade fair or the unguarded behind a laptop in a hotel room is not advisable , to say the least .
Ulrich Hackenberk , board member at automaker Audi , says that it was standard practice for years , before a board meeting to collect the phones , so that they can be used as a .
The German BAT advises managers to use simple prepaid cell phones when they go on foreign trips , because smartphones may be compromised .
The prepaid phones are thrown away .
However , there is the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .
In Germany , many of these companies are global leaders in their respective niche .
`` Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience , the staff and financial resources to protect trade secrets effectively against unauthorized access , '' warns the BAT in a report .
The US company warn against economic espionage by other countries .
According to the Washington Post , the US National Intelligence Estimate in February , France , Russia and Israel behind China in two of the countries that used for the procurement of economic data from the Hackings .
A member of a German blue-chip company agreed to when it comes to economic espionage , `` the French are the worst . ''
Bernard Squarcini , former head of the French domestic intelligence DCRL , was quoted in an interview this month with the following words : `` The intelligence services know very well that all countries , even if they work together in the fight against terrorism , spying on its allies . ''

Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 U.S. dollars to demand from passengers on their flight hand luggage .
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or soda , even though , in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers are likely to keep the whole box .
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat remain free of charge .
Frontier said it charged 25 if the fee will be paid in advance , and $ 100 for travelers who paid only at the gate .
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said , the fee of $ 100 is introducing travelers to move in the payment .
`` We do not want to charge this amount , '' she said .
Airlines began in 2008 , for the first and second checked baggage fees .
Passengers who tried to circumvent this , therefore , plugged into the cabin baggage as much as possible , with the result that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded on the seat .
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board .
O 'Malley said , the new fee , it is not really trying to make money .
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier , which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat .
Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline , do not have to pay .
This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier , a bag for free , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of luggage .
O 'Malley said , the website of Frontier and check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate .
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only come into force in the summer , an exact date is not yet .
Passengers often grumbled about baggage surcharges and other fees , but airlines are happy to fall back on .
They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it .
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
But so far , however , the fingers of charges for hand luggage .
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago , the first charges for hand luggage and later , Allegiant Air , a low-cost carriers .
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely followed the additional charges .
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that bring the hand baggage fee Spirit $ 50 million a year .
Sorensen , who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines , recently flown with spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate , when passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .
`` The boarding process was one of the smoothly I have seen in my career in aviation , '' he said .
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and physical discussions at the gate .
`` The plane was full , '' he said , `` and the boarding as lubricated . ''
Frontier spirit is also the $ 2 for coffee , tea , soda or juice .
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice , would keep the whole box and will be free coffee .
Water is still free of charge .
In 2008 , U.S. Airways had tried to demand for soft drinks , but seven months later , after passengers complained and was opposed to any other big company .
Frontiers step to charge for hand luggage , passengers do not buy directly from the airline , is the latest initiative to customers on its own website .
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold .
It provides all companies an incentive to get passengers to the direct purchase with them on an online travel agency .
Frontier has gone , however , is the most in this area .
In September , the company began , when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles .
On Wednesday the miles have been cut to 25 percent of the flight .
A third-party booked a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers therefore only 250 miles .
Passengers can also book exclusively to the direct purchase on the website of Frontier .
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .
The revenue fell by 9 percent and the flight capacity fell almost 13 percent in the first quarter , as reported in the financial report , which was released on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc. , .
Republic has tried to get under the sale of the company 's finances of Frontier .

Hearing before the Royal Commission , charged with two YMCA staff before accusations against Jonathan Lord accused of sex offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 accusations against child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children .
But the opening statement before the Commission had declared the YMCA , `` in the organization never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse . ''
Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee for offences had been charged with child pornography , and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 because of the abuse of children entrusted to him had been convicted .
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission assistierenden lawyer that he had known of the first case , but the second was not known .
He acknowledged that the YMCA opening statement to the Commission was also vague on the assertion that `` there was external reviews of the YMCA , in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety . ''
Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he is the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Department of Education ) has received in August of this year .
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , admitted that the management `` from me downwards '' in the recruitment of Lord and to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety .
Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offences in twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA at the beginning of the .
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison .
Hare denied , however , that the YMCA had a cultural problem that employees have to report violations in relation to the Lords regarding the safety of children .
The employees said that they had observed violations , among other things , that Lord was alone with children , she worked as a babysitter , they sit on his lap , said that he had loved it , and children play with his mobile phone .
Danielle Ockwell , whose leader was Lord , who had asked for a training course on child protection , because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the Kinderdienstleiterin Jacqui Barnat , who was at the YMCA Caringbah the supervisors Lords daunting , `` and most of the time was very remote . ''
The CEO said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors .
Instead , he said , have affected their friendship with Lord their judgment , which is why they had not reported it .
Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organisation from the Jonathan Lord incident `` , not '' affects reporting `` by staff , and the board voted to approve him .
Hare said that the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations , the managing director of children 's services of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .
He said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented , but it was `` overzealous '' and poorly implemented .
The YMCA NSW was at a time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , no safe for children , said Professor Stephen Small Bone of Griffith University , an expert on child sexual abuse , of the Commission .
He explained that it had been `` serious problems '' in the recruitment , screening , training , training and supervision of employees .
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .

Blocked court decision to stop-and-Frisk directive of the NYPD
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the formation of a judge , the changes to the stop-and-Frisk Program ( `` stop and search '' ) of the New York Police Department , and the judge absolving them from the case .
The stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city .
The judge had ruled in August , the city was in the Constitution with the way the programme will be implemented for stopping and questioning of people .
The city appealed against their assessment and ordered remedial measures , including the decision to set up a monitoring body , which should support the police in changing its directive and the corresponding training programme .
The appeal court heard the arguments on Tuesday the suspension .
The report said that the judge had to be released from the case because they have violated the code of conduct for American judge , is determined that a judge is to avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements , in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court .
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the BMW Demotika program .
It has appointed an outside agency to monitor the implementation of significant changes , including reforms in directives , training and supervision , and ordered a pilot program with the body cameras in areas where most of the checks were carried out .
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were sacked after an inspection by the police .
One of the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014 .
The stop-and-Frisk-tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates .
Such controls are there for decades in various forms , but the number of recorded controls during the term of the partyless Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .
In 2004 , was submitted by four men , all minorities , , which developed into a class action .
Advocates of changes to the stop-and-Frisk Program of the NYPD say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way , like other police chiefs use the scheme .
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police , but not the crime ; wasted money and would not solve the broader problem of a police force that is after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade .
The judge pointed out that they do not finish the stop-and-Frisk practice was constitutional , but only the kind of the implementation of controls by the NYPD reformiere .

John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that the US spying was `` inappropriate gone too far . ''
John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission softening the defensive attitude of the United States in terms of their surveillance programs , saying that the espionage is inappropriate in certain cases , `` gone too far . ''
The foreign minister also admitted that he bore responsibility for the fact that we have switched on `` autopilot '' with Barack Obama , when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower , Edward Snowden about the NSA 's spying activities .
The leaked information is the U.S. government in a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies .
In a speech transmitted by video link on the Open Government conference in London , Kerry said : `` there is no question , the President and I and others in the government of some of the things that happened almost by autopilot , simply because the ability to do so , even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , goes back to 9 / 11 . ''
Then he became the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US spying have crossed a line , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .
He said : `` In some cases , the inappropriate has gone too far . ''
The president is determined to create clarity , and therefore a thorough investigation so that no one must have the feeling that abuse .
I can assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected .
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force for good and have been saved many lives through its surveillance operations .
He added : `` We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up in the air . ''
There is a radical extremism in the world , which is keen to kill people to blow up in the air and attacking governments .
So what if we would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens ?
We have actually prevented attacks on buildings , plane crashes and the killing of people , because we have learned in advance of such plans .
Meanwhile , US lawmakers will travel to Europe , in order to dispel the doubts about the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need for the anti-terror efforts continue to cooperate with the United States , as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday .
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut , said that he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and is concerned about their threats not to participate because of frustration over the surveillance by the National Security Agency to anti-terror organizations .
`` It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism remain on board , '' said Murphy , who is in the Senate for the first time as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European affairs , and , in an interview in Washington .
Moreover , I go to Europe , in order to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the NSA programs .
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe , have strained relations with some US allies , although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and with the United States .
Other revelations quoted from documents provided by Snowden further that the NSA had monitored the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state leaders around the world .
The director of national intelligence , James Clapper , defended the spying on allies as necessary and said that this was customary on both sides .
In all the uproar , Murphy said that his agency is preparing the journey of the Congress , which is due to take place this year , and hoped the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers .
The names of the other MPs are to be published in the coming days .
He said that the exact itinerary will be worked out .
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is to improve the improvement of relations , he also said that there would be some `` serious words . ''
He said that the European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs that they themselves for years .
`` We can change our surveillance programs and better protect the rights of Europeans , but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , '' said Murphy .
Meanwhile , stands for John Kerry over the weekend , a trip to the Middle East and to Poland , to deal with the resentment over the US strategy in Syria , Egypt and Iran , as well as the US surveillance activities .

Council takes tracks targeted
The railway crossing `` Hirschen '' to improve road safety ?
Yes , the local councils have decided .
Schiltach must take for 220 000 euros .
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve in the coming year , the Kinzigtal-rail route .
In particular , to increase the safety at railway crossings - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles .

This has been controversial in the municipal council , as some councils , the need for road expansion in doubt : Thomas Kipp , saying the mood of the critics : `` We have to because so few vehicles so much money ? ''
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed : The railway crossing `` Hirschen will regularly used for .
Even wood from the area `` Kuhbach '' will be transported via this route , because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route to the Häberlesbrücke there , because they could not turn on the main street .
In addition , the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked , Haas argued .

The administration had Breinlinger examine the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering firm , because they had doubts as to whether the planned end of the Geroltzhäuser route is still possible .
The investigation concluded that it is that the tendency of the road conditions could lead to longer vehicles .
Responsibility for this , in turn , the city as a .
The reconstruction could take liability disputes .
Since both the wood collection and turning in the current state of development , we should not support the reconstruction of the railway crossing , Haas argued .
It is also the risk of a collision of with a vehicle on the transition of significantly lower than the other railroad crossings , because the in the middle , which is a good view .
Even trains from the main railway station should be slowed down at this point as far as that no collision .
The approval was the reconstruction of the railway crossing refused because the city Schiltach `` the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles '' would have to pay , the councils , as , as the train after the construction of the responsibility .

Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
In the West African country , there are not many doctors , only one in 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 `` CNN Heroes of 2013 . ''
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 in order to elect him to the `` CNN Hero of the Year '' .
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue its work .
21 years , Georges Bwelle of his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him .
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .
First , he had a broken arm , but it was an inflammation , which to his brain and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life .
`` There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon , '' said Georges Bwelle .
We have released him from Cameroon , if we had the money .
Instead , Bwelle spent years to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer .
`` It is not easy , '' Bwelle said .
You can leave the house at five o `` clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first one , and it is not first .
There are very many patients .
Indeed , some people die because they have to wait .
The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002 .
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .
In contrast , the ratio is in the United States with a doctor for 413 people .
But even if there was a doctor for them , could not afford most Cameroonians the visit .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private .
`` The only problem they have is poverty , '' says Bwelle .
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
His father , and so many of his countrymen to see suffer ripened in Bwelle decided to do something about it .
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations last year .
He was a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .
He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care .
Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people .
Almost every Friday and up to 30 people in minibuses and continue with the helpless medical equipment on the roof of unbefestigtes terrain in the villages , need help .
Not everything runs smoothly .
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .
But when they arrive , they are welcomed as heroes : A feast , singing and dancing and the best accommodation , the place has to offer .
In these villages , free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - the joyful celebration .
The next morning , the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients .
`` We treat 500 people per trip , '' Bwelle .
You come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village and on foot .
Each of these weekend clinics offering medical care in a number of areas .
Many people are being treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
Others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates , a document that is required for the school , but many poor families simply can not afford .
In the evening , the team simple operations with local anaesthetic .
The operations are normally held in a school , the City Hall or an apartment ; after the procedure , the patient and go in the recreation area , in order to make room for the next person .
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday .
It is an arduous work , but the village musicians usually help to keep the team .
`` They drum all night , so that we can stay awake and continue our work , '' says Bwelle .
On Sunday , the team goes back to the city , tired but proud of the work .
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has carried out last year , 700 free operations and know that it makes an enormous difference to the people with their work , which helps them .
A man explained that the free operation of that he had received enabled him to return to work .
`` The changes the future of my family , '' the man said .
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .
With this second job he finanziere 60 % of its charitable activities , Bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .
`` I really do not know when he is asleep , '' says Katie O `` Malley , who for the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily participates in Bwelles group .
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization , so that he can go to these campaigns .
For medical and nursing students such as O `` Malley , who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience they would never get at home .
`` We can be in operations , where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , '' explains O 'Malley .
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .
The students pay for their trip to Cameroon normally themselves and often donated medical equipment .
But they are in Yaoundé , Bwelle accommodation , transport and guide .
`` He is undoubtedly a hero , '' says O `` Malley .
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people , knows no boundaries .
For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a burden .
Others to give to a happier life , and thus to fulfill a promise he made to his father , he has a great deal of pleasure .
`` I am so happy when I make this work , '' says Bwelle .
And I am thinking of my father .
I hope he sees what I do .
I do it to get people to laugh and to alleviate the pain .

The disposable society does not think
The night was long , loud music and the mood is good , but at some point , it is home .
In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat of hunger .
Clearly , a cocktail or champagne may be responsible for it .
What is more natural than chilled to drive to the next Drive-In to take a bite ?
I admit that I am happy with it , if it is late at night or early in the morning to fast food-fetching .
A few fries , a Coke and a burger - and then as the home and go to bed .
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco Gängern .
What must be missing that constant regularity of its fast-food bags from the car window ? !
Especially at the weekends discarded paper bags around streets and parking lots .
`` Why ? , '' I wonder .
The people are too stupid to take the bags home or until the next dustbin ?
It is not just that the landscape disfigured the paper .
Bags have also been concealed transport facilities such as crash barriers and triggered accidents .
So what does this `` disposable society '' but not , presumably , they do not even know what that word means .
If it is more often , especially with several people in the car , you know how to take a back seat after all nights : Clothes , bottles and other garbage are there .
There were a few bags more or less , but nothing - in contrast to the street , where no one wants to eat the remains of other rumtrampeln .
I can already see the day when the cities and communities to dopey removal - and the fast-food chains for their bags .

The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of the destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable , which is aimed at the destruction of all Syria 's chemical weapons by mid-2014 .
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can produce no new chemical weapons .

Cocaine addict lawyer , warned the drug boss before police investigation , will go to prison
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information on underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense lawyers , warned of a drug baron in front of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade , after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction .
The Kriminalisten as a `` first-class '' vaunted lawyer nicknamed `` Bash '' was arrested at his home in 2011 , after the police had monitored Scarborough , which he had represented in a previous drug trial .
Officials watched as Scarborough ( 32 ) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , , while it was the with colleagues during a meal .
The investigations have revealed that regularly consumed class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet and credit cards .
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .
All four suspects were monitored by the police as part of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .
They , along with 32 other people were arrested after the police in a series of raids heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds in cash .
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals , because he feared that his drug addiction can be publicised .
Today , , who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , at Liverpool Crown Court after weeks of two counts of obstruction of justice , found guilty and sentenced .
He admitted the cocaine possession in a previous survey .
The lawyer was convicted after the police found in their investigations of Scarborough , that he had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with disappointment .
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the dustbin of the lawyer .
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs , called Scarborough regularly with preferring , who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park .
The lawyer returned home , the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two .
In court , it became known that was a `` regular consumer '' of cocaine , after tests of class A drugs were discovered in his hair , his wallet and credit cards .
He was later arrested , but denied to take cocaine and said that he had spoken with the alleged dealer , because this was his client , and claimed that their discussion , `` lawyer secret . ''
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were seized and he was taken from a hair sample .
The police interrogation , he admitted , he both under his home address and an office in the workplace and clients would call him at home because of legal issues .
In court , it became known that he is in the drug trade , some of which he had previously called for significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about it .
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : `` A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else , does not break the law . ''
He is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer , because he has too much with certain clients .
The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs .
Part of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer for these people .
But that went far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
He was the police investigation as far as possible , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .
Mr preferring brought his profession into disrepute .
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed that his independence was compromised .
Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing and claimed : `` If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , then I would not wait for 15 hours , but do it immediately . ''
But after the hearing , said Lee Halstead , superintendent of police in Lancashire : `` Mr preferring has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal when he began to buy drugs from organised criminals . ''
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime , which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and trust and confidence in the public .
He has betrayed that trust and trying to hide behind the facade of his profession .
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire headed the investigation against , which led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .
This case should serve as a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
We will find you and bring you to justice .
Scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared the conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .
Thirty-five people were sentenced to total fines of 153 years for drug offences .
On his website published disappointment over a range of questions and answers about where he , his dream job , as a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America , his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work .

Under the new guidelines , airlines whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions could allow its passengers to use the devices , landing on the tarmac , the FAA said .
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi in , should meet the criteria .
Laura Glading , president of the Association of professional flight attendants , welcomed the changes .
`` If the new regulation is implemented , and we are working closely with the airline , both sides will benefit from it , '' said Glading .
We are to be honest , we feel like watchdogs on this issue .
Nevertheless , Internet connections for surfing , exchange of e-mails , text messages or downloading data at three kilometers , the agency explained .
Passengers are urged to smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
So there is still no `` words With Friends , '' the scrabble classified online game that the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines , because he refused to shut down the device , while the plane was parked at the gate .
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored , because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain banned .
The regulatory authority for telephone conversations at the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .
FAA lifts may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
Last month , said Mark Rosenker of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board , security expert for national transport issues at CBS News , mobile phones are still seen as a risk .
`` Mobile is really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation equipment , but because we know from the FCC that can disrupt the transfer from the air , '' said Rosenker .
An advisory committee of the industry , which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices .
In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use .
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCas kill from Missouri are of the opinion that there is no valid security reasons for the ban .
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous .
In some studies , up to one-third of the passengers , the closure of the device or ignored .
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers , after reports of disturbances of navigation and communications equipment of passengers bears FM radios were , the latest technology trend .
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference .
Airlines offer passengers for several years , Wi-Fi , if the altitude is reached .
The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference .
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices , according to the new guidelines , Huerta said .
Today 's electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations .
E-mail reader , for example , give only minimal radiation , if you umblättert .
But when downloading or sending data transmission values are stronger .
Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the devices use by passengers is Amazon.com .
In 2011 , invited an airliner full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight in order to identify problems , but could not .
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices .
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers Association passenger said he was of the opinion that the disruption of the device is real , even if the risk is minimal .
Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who did speak for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .
The committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to mandate in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the devices by the passengers .
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes , describing it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who today would be equipped with technology .
`` We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that it is not a pleasant passenger experience is to safety , '' said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be for the first time on 22 February appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church , the Vatican announced on Thursday .
Cardinals are the most senior cleric in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are also to elect a pope , Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor .
Currently , there are 201 cardinals .
However , a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years , no longer take part in the papal election - which is a group of 120 `` '' .
In a statement , in which the news was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman said , there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals , which is also known as a consistory .
`` Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , '' said Lombardi .
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices , said that the number of voting cardinals will probably be dropped until February .
He explained that a pope usually take so many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of voting cardinals 120 , and so many cardinals over 80 , as he would like .
The consistory next year is so important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , Valero .
Currently , there is some overhang on the part of Europe , and especially in Italy .
`` It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world , in order to restore the balance , '' he said .
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the church .
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .
`` Francis has selected eight cardinals who will help him , '' said Valero .
He explained that it was `` quite possible '' that the Cardinals Francis ask for advice .
But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all very new .
Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to Cardinals , but Francis was `` full of surprises , so we do not know whom he appoints . ''

Verzweiflungs cry of an Obama voter
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the blocking tactics by Republicans
The blockade policy does not apologize the website problems of Obamacare , the drone strikes
Obama 's memoir about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible .
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .
I read a terribly sad book .
It is a book that I thought it would be sad during the second year medical student cheering up and give me hope .
It is called `` the Audacity to Win '' ( courage to win ) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election .
In the evening , I am finished with my patients transcripts and go to bed , then the book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and .
The election was a landslide victory and the to lead the historical significance of this hour .
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find .
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .
Obama into office in 2008 , he had approval voting values of 82 % .
And then I close the book .
Switch back to the present is a rude awakening , as if it is from a dream .
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
In the years since I made my voice for the first time , something has changed .
But there is simply nothing that I could have imagined .
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved by the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .
I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have too many efforts , with whom our nation should be brought forward : Immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay , to name a few .
But after countless times , I have defended the Obama administration to colleagues and friends , I am with my point at the end .
I have reached a point of political desperation .
The Republican obstructionism can not explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .
It can not explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers should be punished , the government misconduct .
It can not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki was an American citizen , was killed without trial , nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections .
It does not justify the results of a report , which says that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media are the `` most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration . ''
And the most recent can not excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .
I do not know if that is what I should have expected .
If I have to understand that the government could contradict the previous political campaigns .
Apparently , the is not a predictable course Abgeordnetenamt , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate .
But when I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
And that bothers me the most .
I was re-elected in 2012 , Obama , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative , he seemed not its direction and positions .
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hopes that we had heard for so long .
But with the drop in approval ratings for Obama to below 45 % this week to return to 2008 through this book .
It makes me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into thin air .
This week I read a section in the book , which describes how Obama has had a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania .
In a meeting with election officials after the decision , he told his staff , they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
`` I want us to find our magic , '' he said .
We need to remember who we are .
There are five years later , Mr. President , and I could not agree with you more .
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris .

George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day , a new horror story to independence .
This time , we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .
This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the .
In fact , it was in the Strathclyde template pointed to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe , but this was - as expected - played no role in the headlines .
No one has also mentioned that the EU member states often bent their strict rules , if it is convenient for them .
As Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area , would be the continued disregard for Brussels , only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots .
That is not really a story .
And one that is already happened in the years that it already looks like a fossil : The , the first time I have heard the `` independence means passport controls '' duck at least 40 years .
This is an interesting point in the constant refrain of this ancient history .
Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that dances to the tune of Europe ?
Why the London yoke against the trade from Brussels , especially now ?
These are the real European news : The large , taken after the war plan to the unification of Europe is stalled .
With the euro crisis , the European project is officially dead .
Throughout the EU parties are gaining ground , the EU or the euro as a common currency to throw overboard .
Even in Germany , the Eurosceptic party founded Alternative for Germany - until this year - nearly five million votes in the federal election in September , and distribute effectively , the Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .
There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .
The current economic crisis , it is a turning point .
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , in connection with the straitjacket , forced into the national economy by adhering to the common currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits - that was the case in Greece .
Instead , the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates , which are beneficial for German exporters - and the German politicians would like to .
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency will take place in southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage against Germany .
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin .
Behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .
As a result of the imposed by Brussels `` green '' energy policy - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas .
This is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .
All the world protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American shale gas .
As a result of a revolt , especially in France , the former cheerleader of the EU .
After the war , the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
However , Berlin , Paris does not need more than a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy , which the ailing French economy .
The result : Marine Le Pen 's right-wing , EU anti-National Front has just won a key by-election and the ruling Socialists in three .
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it can not assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left .
What makes Le Pen , with their newly gained popularity among the white working-class French ?
She would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-EU currency bloc in the European Parliament .
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and it is very possible for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament .
This is the point I want to make : In the not too distant future , the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come to the abolition of the euro .
The EU will not disappear , but it is something like the `` Europe '' ( sovereign ) nations favored General de Gaulle .
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .
I expect that Great Britain distanced itself from the project , hoping to curry favour with the United States .
However , Washington 's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain .
Where is Scotland in all this ?
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) .
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken .
I suspect that Scotland could go in a looser European Grouping quite well , as long as we keep our own currency .
The cooperation with other like-minded countries , is not in a federal Europe of the Nations easier .
Otherwise , we should consider it emulate Norway and keep our economic independence .
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has 2011 spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed ( and ) cuts made by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition .
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence , only to be imposed by Berlin and Brussels austerity .

`` Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices during takeoff and landing , should not be used , and we currently have no plans to change that , '' said the company .
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines .
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers , and will look at the FAA 's decision and the reasons behind it .
The decision on US companies vary depending on the age of the fleet .
They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , hand luggage-change programs and customer training .
`` After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers using portable , lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smart phones at every level , '' the FAA announced .
In rare cases where visibility , the crew will instruct the passengers , the landing gear .
The group also recommended that heavier equipment at takeoff and landing safely under the seat or in the lockers .

Patek , who was nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia on the run , was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to a sentence of 20 years .
With punitive suspension , he could be released after 15 years .
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , in which 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many more were injured .
A guilty verdict in a series of terrorism-related charges , including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence , even if they can apply for the man who , because of its reputation as a wordless bomb maker known as `` Demolition Man , '' could have requested the death penalty .
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen , a mother from Perth , the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his Mitverschwörern almost ten years ago .
Fighting back tears , she said , Patek should have been sentenced to death .
I mean , he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
`` We should put him in front of a firing squad , '' said Corteen to AAP .
I have to live with every day that I will get no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters .
The Sari Club was razed to the ground , on 12 October 2002 , shortly after 11 p.m. , a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck that was parked in front of the nightclub .
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier , a suicide bombers explode a backpack filled with explosives .
He fell into a coma after the attack for a month and `` died '' three times while he was on a life support system .
Hughes said Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah , Amrozi , Mukhlas and Imam Samudra , who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago .
Really , this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else .
To keep him alive - no , there is no reason to keep him alive .
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds , is not much .
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers , who was in court .
He cheated nearly a decade of arrest , but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces less than four months later , the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killed .
During the trial , with an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the reference that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and to rebuild .
`` He has not arisen , '' said Corteen .
Until recently , he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has caused to other people .
The verdict came before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year , which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia .
`` This year , there will be many tears , '' said Corteen .
Patek can still appeal against his sentence .

Early puberty : Grow up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age , as studies show .
Physical changes mean not directly puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues .
A mother should be worried if her daughter grow at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and pubic hair ?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando , Florida , said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard .
`` I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - normally , this is not a sign that is now fast puberty , '' explained Kaplowitz .
Obvious indicators of development , such as growing breasts , Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor , with girls .
However , there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche ( first menstruation ) in the last 40 years .
In the United States , the average age at 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
`` If the development of breasts , it takes at least two to three years to the , '' said Kaplowitz , author of the book `` early puberty in girls : The essential guide to deal with this problem frequently occurring . ''
Time is the most accurate test , which is progressing puberty .
It is controversial , which is actually the onset of puberty , but it is `` precocious , '' if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years .
In most cases , the process slowed down or stalled – something that can monitor a pediatrician .
For faster progress could be by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumors and cysts .
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence : The premature aging of the bones , which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults .
The recommendations for a medical or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .
Psycho-social aspects are also important .
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he admits : `` The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their age . ''
The other major problem is understandable : Parents simply do not want their very young daughters have the period .
`` They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side , '' Kaplowitz said .
`` It was a shock , '' recalls a woman whose daughter has received with ten days .
Even if there were signs and we had talked about menstruation , they were not prepared emotionally .
She was scared and excited by the school home because it was the first in her group of friends .
There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty .
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .
Young are similar girls before puberty .
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity .
He supported girls on the implementation of a study in 2001 at the age of six to nine years , which establishes a connection between body fat and entering puberty .
Other studies support that conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .
In this country , African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be rather than their white age .
There are different reasons for this .
Globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , economic conditions on the climate to the genes .
Another mystery : Although boys grow facial and pubic hairs earlier , the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .
Other doctors on the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue .
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even babies and young children .
`` We have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , '' said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .
Parents should not hesitate to take advice from their doctor , how they should talk to their child .
`` This may mean that you have a conversation earlier than expected , '' advised Kaplowitz .
If you stay calm , the child is usually good .
Girls who early bloom , need the insurance , the process is a normal part of life , even if it happens sooner than expected .

My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , late and dress for the neighborhood .
Today , I am more the Halloween muffle .
In the last two years , I have not declared ready to distribute sweets from my apartment , and it will probably not do this year .
But , according to the statistics , I am a black sheep on Halloween .
The majority of Americans - 158 million , to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year , a total of $ 6.9 billion for candy , costumes and decorations , according to the American Association of retailers ( ) .
One thing that I am pleased every Halloween then again , the trend values .
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .
This year , provocative inanimate objects are the rage .
Women must no longer remain in sexy clothes , they can now also tempting food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
As for men , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that Daft Punk space men will succeed this year in the Instagram feeds .
According to Google , the most sought-after costumes zombies , Batman , pirates and witches .
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
Last year we have our dogs and were not alone , to my surprise .
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year for costumes of their pets , according to the .
There are a lot of `` hot dogs . ''
As for sweets , we are not squeamish .

That is about nine billion corn grains .
It is a mystery that I could not solve .
Nothing is more on Halloween than houses where it haunts .
You have great names like `` terror Behind the Walls '' ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , `` '' and `` the House of Shock . ''
In fact , there are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States , which is $ 500 million in revenue , America Haunts , and that includes the wonderful photographs of the trousers and friends on Facebook , where you do not get rid of them , and then the guy that leave a comment like `` nice facial expression .

Fortunately , the `` baby in the pumpkin '' trend began only last year thanks to Villepinte rest , so most of us have grown up with it , as the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and not to sit in it .
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million for pumpkins , according to the US Census Bureau .

Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden is ready in principle to a meeting with German authorities .
First , he wants to know , however , his situation is clarified .
This has made it clear that the United States wanted former NSA employees in a letter addressed to the Green politician Hans-Christian Stroebele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and published by the federal government , parliament and Attorney General relayed .
The letter , according to a translation by Stroebele reads as follows :
The officials
I was asked to write to you about your investigation to mass surveillance .
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and used by contract or a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .
In the course of my employment in these facilities , I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government that led me from a moral duty to act .
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw I was exposed to a serious and persistent campaign that forced me to leave my family and my home .
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum , which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law .
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the United States and elsewhere .
Citizens around the world and high officials - including the United States - have the revelations to a system of mass surveillance , which is accountable to nobody , as a service to the public .
The spying revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public trust .
The benefits to society from these findings is becoming clearer ; at the same time , the risks visibly reduced .
Although the result of my efforts demonstrably positive , my government treated dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize political expression and put on trial .
However , the truth is not a crime .
I am confident that the government of the United States , with the support of the international community that prejudicial attitudes .
I hope that I , if the problems are resolved this humanitarian situation , will be able to take part of the facts about the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports , appropriately and in accordance with law .
I am looking forward to a conversation with you in your country , once the situation is clarified , and I thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all .

Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman organic health
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are linked to the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government can not waste the money of the state .
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take `` immediate measures '' to avert a crisis that has been caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints .
The funding for a period of four years , it was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie .
`` The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe that the unique challenges faced by the federal government , '' Plibersek said today .
The 325-million-dollar package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid for election .
Further 2600 operations , including orthopedic surgery and treatments for grey Star , residues are to be eliminated .
In addition , there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better aftercare for inpatient stays , the specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .
`` These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , '' said Tanya Plibersek .
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government .
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth , and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent .
A three-member commission will be set up and is designed to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million dollars of little use if `` they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course . ''
Nevertheless , he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for urgent aid , which he first expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May .
`` I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health system in the state of the list of concerns , '' said Wilkie .
According to the federal government , the state electoral services are largely offset the recent cuts .
But the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today 's announcement is only a `` Band-Aid solution . ''
`` We are in today 's situation , because the Labor state government $ 430 million from the health system , '' he said on ABC TV .
It is not that a state government almost half a billion dollars from the system and the Commonwealth 300 million and then pretend that the good news .
Dutton called Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .

Profits at Bombardier to decline in supply figures and contracts
The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15 % drop in net profit , after he was caught by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure .
Bombardier , based in Montreal , a flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information on whether the plane could go under the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use .
On the maiden flight test aircraft followed one and a half months , so far , only three more starts , which the question of whether the testing phase is proceeding as planned .
The results were back behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
Cameron Doerksen , an analyst at National Bank Financial , on Thursday lowered its rating of `` outperform '' from `` sector perform '' in view of the fact that the stock in the next one to two quarters of a limited course potential .
`` Although weaker delivery figures were expected to aircraft , but the margins of development in the transport sector , we are clearly disappointed , '' Doerksen said in a client .
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries , if the test program is progressing on the plane .
If , however , no new orders will be announced in the coming months , we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program .
Bombardier hopes that the aircraft series of CSeries can catapult the company into the market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .
The first test plane was presented to the public in March , after months of delays and flew for the first time in September .
But so far are binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate , as potential buyers want to wait and see the results of the flight tests whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new commercial jet aircraft .
Currently , there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets .
The company said on Thursday with analysts and media in addition , the program is in the schedule .
`` The test aircraft is no longer than expected , on the ground , '' said Beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft were ground tests and software updates .
Each manufacturer is planning .
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period , what we have done .
This is happening throughout the flight programme .
The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it said .
However , analysts remain sceptical as to whether 12 months after the maiden flight of the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft in operation .
Bombardier said it checked the planning for the commissioning ( EIS ) and will update this in the next few months .
`` The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 , '' Doerksen said .
In the third quarter with the end on 30 September Bombardiers net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .
The adjusted earnings per share is unchanged 9 cents .
Sales slipped slightly , and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars .
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S .
The world 's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decrease of 57 last year .
Net orders fell from 83 to 26 .
The order book in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September , and was unchanged compared with December 31 .
`` In the field of aerospace , the results were in the framework of our targets , but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing , '' said Beaudoin .
Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars .
Bombardier , the world 's largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this area has increased by nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
The order book in the transport sector , on September 30 , $ 32.6 billion dollars and was slightly increased to 31 December .
The profit margin in the field of transport has been hampered by handling problems in some big contracts .
According to corporate governance , there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter .
In afternoon trading on Thursday , the Bombardier shares by 8.5 percent and stood at 4,83 Canadian dollars , after it was announced that the Google CFO Patrick Pichette will switch to the board .
Brazil 's Embraer SA , the world 's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardiers closest rival , reported a 10 % drop in quarterly profit on Thursday .

Egypt 's first freely elected president sworn in
Mohammed Morsi , the presidential oath , but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt .
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a `` new Egypt , '' as he was sworn in as the country 's first freely elected president of the and thus the succession of Hosni Mubarak , who had been driven from office 16 months earlier .
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt 's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
He put the oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court , which has its headquarters on the Nile and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple .
`` We strive for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , '' Morsi said at the ceremony , which was broadcast live on state television .
`` Today the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , '' said the 60-year-old Morsi , an engineer trained in the , and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that since its founding in 84 years ago , mostly as a banned organisation , the government .
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy .
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president , and unlike the presidential pomp Mubarak-era was only briefly stopped traffic , so that the car convoy was able to cross the usually bustling street , the city centre with the southern suburbs .
As uncharismatisches `` spare tire '' the Brotherhood has mocked his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists , but all those who wanted the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak to your destination .
`` Egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional and modern state , '' said in a blue suit with a red tie Morsi judges in the wood-panelled chamber , in which he took the oath of office .
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo , where he should keep his inaugural speech .
He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem , which he listened to in Habachtstellung .
The military leader , Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present .
On his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the largest university classroom with chants of `` the army and the people are one hand .
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , Cairo University has developed in the 1970s to a stronghold of Islamist groups of students .
Morsi , on Friday a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square , the birthplace of the uprising last year at the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak , and he has vowed to reclaim presidential powers that , the by the turn of the head of state .
But , with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual in front of the , he is to the will of the military , which shows that the power struggle will continue .
Morsi 's speech at the Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .

ESA decides on large space missions : Missions for billions
Distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years .
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .
Distant worlds .
More than 1000 planets around other stars , astronomers have already found .
Whether there is at least some of them , no one knows .
The selection is difficult : One is to look for gravitational waves ?
Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos ?
Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life ?
These questions are the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA .
For its program `` Cosmic Vision '' they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research .
The budget for such missions `` l '' is about a billion euros .
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
At the beginning of September , met in Paris , the elite of European space research , to discuss proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were discussed , five of which are now in the final round .
Many bodies examine the proposals , according to the researchers .
In the next few days , a final decision by the scientific program committee .
A total of four major issues has chosen the Esa , to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated `` cosmic vision '' to find answers .
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life ?
The exact processes for the formation of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit stars - they are still in the proverbial dark .
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .
And if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can arise ?
In order to investigate this issue will start in 2017 , the space telescope `` , '' with the 500 already known planetary systems in our neighbourhood .
The possibilities are limited , however , is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .
With larger instruments astronomers erdähnliche planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for `` biomarkers '' : Gases , which are seen as an indicator for biological activity .
How does the solar system ?
Ultimately , this question is to say what conditions for the emergence of life .
Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from the system .
In our solar system , these processes can .
With the `` solar Orbiter '' Esa already has a mission of the M-class ( the budget is around half a billion euros ) for this question .
The probe will start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun .
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons .
You want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .
The Esa sees the first of the three L-missions of the `` Cosmic Vision '' programme .
The probe `` juice '' ( Jupiter Icy moons Explorer ) begins its journey to 2022 .
Eight years later they reached Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa , Ganymede and .
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the known laws of nature are still valid .
Maybe there are deviations , the physicists could point the way to a new theory that all known laws of nature .
How the universe was created and what is it ?
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos was created by the Big Bang .
In addition to the usual from the stars , planets and life as we are , there is dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies , and dark energy , which is the expansion of the .
So far , the researchers do not know what physical laws of physics in the first of the Big Bang 'split second were valid , is dark matter and dark energy .
`` Euclid '' the Esa has already been approved by a mission , whose launch is scheduled for 2020 .
With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky , and thus allow conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals will remain at the end of the selection process only two .
The best chances of approval as a mission , according to many experts `` E-Lisa , '' a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves .
Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago .
They were not detected .
Elisa could create the , the scientists hope behind the project .
The mission provides two or three probes existing detector , which is stationed in space .
He could , in contrast to plants on Earth 's gravitational waves , which are in the Big Bang , and thus provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos .
Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission : A large X-ray telescope called `` Athena , '' which , among other things , is to explore black holes , `` icy planets , '' another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , `` Prism , '' a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation , and the `` Exoplanet Finder '' to detect and investigate the erdähnliche planet .
Already retired include proposals on the sample-return transport from Mars , the exploration of the moon , Venus and asteroids and , as well as to the solar physics .

You could call him the Dostoyevsky in the United States .
Philip K. Dick was a god viewfinder , a meta-physicist , his novels and stories have something serial .
Amazingly the kinship abroad : The sharp eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
And so , as M. Fyodor Dostoevsky , with its massive oeuvre as Ergründer and apologist for the Russian soul , read Philip K. Dick as American Prophet , which is something in their own country .
Some titles are published in the world , the Lagoon Mans-cassette with 118 stories sells two thousand one .
Dick explains America - the realm of the breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security and the belief , to be chosen .
Dick had God 's experiences , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .
Perhaps he was crazy , drugs had added to his brain .
He figured early on that the computer Divinitäten .
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine , the creator of his creation .
This is the `` Blade Runner 'problem .
The killing .
A master of science fiction .
A fantastic writer .
His stories have inspired film directors like Ridley Scott , Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg .
Now this story is particularly significant .
The `` Minority Report '' dates back to 1956 , he exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals .
It is the principle of `` pre-crime '' developed , `` '' , which is now more or less official doctrine of the White House .
In Dicks world that resembles our own terrifying mutants look to the future - and the police .
`` We collect individuals who have violated any law , '' says the head of the authority .
`` We catch them before they can commit a violent crime . ''
And : `` In our society , there is no serious criminals , we have a penal camp full of Pesudoverbrecher . '' You read time flows .
They assume that bad things happen , and that the criminal idea into practice .
Dicks narrative acts as the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA eavesdropping .
Anticipation of the attack : So does Obama 's drone philosophy and practice .
But Dicks story is not yet over .
The police chief complained that there is no separation of powers , the military controls the everyday life - and what is left by the state .
The will be monitored and a future crime .
The system is .
It is perfect , but it is lying .
It invents its own conditions .
Errors and victims , not only but builds itself .
The system creates the danger that it .
Philip K. Dick read , again and again to come closer to the truth .

About 80 participants had come into the town hall to explain the measures planned to ask questions to express concerns and ideas .
Häußler was clear : `` The ultimate decisions , the members of the municipal council . ''
The flooding that Gechingen on May 15 , 2009 , unprepared , was a crucial event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , Häußler .
A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbouring village of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for flood protection concept in Gechingen .
`` The protection of cultivated land is the goal , '' says Häußler .

The floods had considerable damage in 2009 Gechingen corresponded to a 1000 -year flood .
`` There is not an absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , '' says Häußler .
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100a climate , must be invested in Gechingen around four million euros , with the municipality can land grants amounting to around 70 percent .
But Häußler pointed out that there is the promotion only if an overall concept .

As the director of the municipal works , Jörg-Arne bias , confirmed to the SUEDKURIER , on a four-member Pfullendorfer family costs 70 to 90 euros per year .

Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which the of a dog with his mood .
Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail stretched more to the right ( from the perspective of the dog ) , while it was the left side in nervous dogs .
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to it .
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : `` In humans is well known that the left and right brain hemisphere react differently to stimuli , positive or negative emotions . ''
Here , we have tried to look at this in other species .
He also noted that in dogs as in humans , the right brain hemisphere for the movement of the left side is responsible and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .
To learn more about how dogs on the side of their , the researchers monitored the animals , while saw these films of other dogs .
They measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed the behavior .
We will soon understand why the tail in the first , in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said : `` We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects , and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ''
If the animals looked like an otherwise ausdrucksloser dog has moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .
But it was the tail to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog wag ) , their increased heart rate and they looked restless .
According to Professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate with each other through these movements .
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience that movements they should worry or not .
He said : `` If you have several encounters with other dogs and a swish with the tail in one direction is associated with friendly behavior and the right side , a less friendly behavior , then you respond on the basis of this experience . ''
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal .
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol , this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs .
Last year , a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left , if they see an aggressive dog , and to the right , if it is a happy dog .
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada : `` Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog , if his tail wag on the left and the right not to be restless , rather than the other way around , as in the Italian study . ''
According to his testimony , the differences could stir , therefore , that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the movies or the robot dogs not interpreted as dogs .
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs , could help , he said .
`` Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes , but many of the details still need to be determined , and dogs are no exception , '' said Bradshaw .
Since their behavior record , but simply put , it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one , sometimes in the opposite direction .

Europe 's elite is ready to do business with the United Kingdom ?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care for prosperity and work in Britain , want to change our relations with the EU .
To this end , we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders , the British company sizes , sectors and regions .
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many .
We have found that the vast majority of businesses now exports outside Europe and focuses on countries to modernize and grow , while the states in the EU .
that the government of new trade ties with countries such as China , India and Brazil are favoured , rather than with the long and arduous process , the obscure to reform EU institutions .
Asked about their views on specific legal issues , from antitrust law to product legislation - the majority of the business leaders of the opinion that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster .
There was a general dissatisfaction with the internal market , since according to the company in the cost of the Brussels rules would outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe 's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the , which are traditionally the most Europhile .
Finally , and this is probably the most , our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority wants a course in the direction of change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU , which is based on trade , not politics .
This realization that is used in companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a `` meaningful change , '' which brings the tiller back to Britain .
It is about much - a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain at 16 percent would lead to a change of view in favor of the EU in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK 's conditions for EU membership .
It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain .
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving in the direction of a closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain , as the result of our survey shows , which means for companies with a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation .

Tripodi denies to have been influenced by Obeid
Against the former Minister of Labor Party , Joe Tripodi from New South Wales launched an investigation by the state corruption supervision .
The former NSW Minister denies to have changed the rules on at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , the hidden stakes in three properties on state-controlled land .
The Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ­ Independent Commission against Corruption ) has extended its investigations on Friday on the question of whether Obeid influenced several government ministers to leases at Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe , without tender after their expiration in August 2005 .
Now is the accusation , Tripodi knew from Obeids concealed interest in the land after the Tripodis former deputy chief of staff , Lynne Ashpole on Thursday .
In years of talks , which began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases .
The tenants were against it , and also wanted longer maturities .
In 2009 , the leases for the company at the Circular Quay , which provided the Obeids $ 2.5 million a year , without a public tender .
Tripodi , who was from February 2006 to November 2009 port minister , had previously argued for public tenders .
But he denied that the changes made at the request of Obeid , who had been as Tripodi confirmed on a review of the lease arrangements of the government .
One of the ICAC 's telephone transcript showed talks from the August and September 2007 between Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved into the port ministry , after he had worked under Obeid in the fisheries authority .
`` The discussion in these telephone conversations , the development of the commercial leasing arrangements ? '' Asked the deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi .
`` No , '' Tripodi said .
I do not remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .

Veganism is the vegetarianism , differs from this , but in a very significant way .
While vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cake , ice cream or a strong Edam , these feasts are not on the menu of a Veganers .
Milk , cheese , eggs , in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegan from all consumption of animal products , including honey is denied .
What remains , one might wonder , but on closer inspection , the vegan food world through a considerable ingenuity .
`` Sandwich spreads are very popular , '' said Ute Henkel Mann , the owner of the local reform House , which provides a variety of special products for vegans .
Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse .
For 13 years , the native New Zealanders vegan , he finds in ( almost ) everything he needs to live . `` In 1997 , I asked my diet and became a vegetarian . ''
At the turn of the century , then the next step and I was vegan .
`` The conviction came not only because of the diet , but because of the shoe choice , '' says Proctor , who prefers artificial leather .
He acknowledged that there is no animal products in other everyday concerns .
First and foremost is his vegan ethics .
`` I do not want to see animals must die for me , '' says Proctor , the maxim of vegans , which covers the entire consumer behaviour .
Instead of burgers , hinterherzutrauern scrambled eggs or rubber bears , I have discovered a new products , the enthusiasm .
`` It is a double bonus , '' says Proctor today , `` in fact , vegan no surrender , no asceticism , but it is an asset . '' The assumption that the man with the selection of dining options , Proctor leads on the power of habit .
And it is precisely these conditions could also fail some well-intentioned attempt .
`` The addiction is a crucial factor , which leaves many give up quickly , similar to smoking , '' Proctor is a comparison .
And : `` Certain tastes are not on the animal . ''
It is often the spices or the type of preparation , which make up the taste .
`` But you can also produce the same effect in other ways , '' the vegan .
At a barbecue Proctor , for example , eggplant , mushrooms and a few Vegan sausages .
He is supposed to a balanced and varied diet , the taste .
Of course , you want to have something between the teeth , which is legitimate .
`` It should taste , but it is not only to reduce animal food , '' says Proctor .
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption that , he had not suffered .
For me , the change has had a positive aspect .
I am no stranger to cholesterol and have a higher vitamin .
There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively .
`` My blood values are well , I am often check , '' says Proctor .
In particular , the lack of vitamin B12 warn many Vegansimus critics .
`` Because animals are fed with feed , rather than graze on pasture , it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer , the vitamin B12 share is high , '' Proctor .
For vegans , there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
`` My B12 values are in order , '' he says .
Proctor must not go for food procurement .
Finally , there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has soy milk and other products .
Everything I need , I find on the ground .
And I buy something special .
`` Many people overlook the fact that it is only the finished products are expensive , but that is the '' ordinary `` finished products . ''
In any case , the preparation of our dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed .
`` In the home kitchen , there is a lot to discover , with a few small tips can be good , if not better results , '' says Proctor .
Margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also bring his in-laws .
Family firm of the vegan gives a new condiment .
This dynamic , when you cook together , has a new significance .
`` The situations that can arise are as diverse as the people themselves , '' says Proctor .
He was , of course , but also scepticism .
You enjoy my food ?
`` I feel bad because I drank milk ? '' - of this kind must be as vegans with tact .
`` I do not reject people , yes , I am part of this society , '' Proctor would not enclaves .
And the everyday world seems to be not so vegan as - and not the in everyday life , as is commonly believed .
Even fast food is allowed .
There are everywhere !
`` Many Döner offer falafel , or a vegetarian Yufka , '' says Proctor .
In a pizzeria he differs on pasta dishes , or a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .
The restaurants are so slow .
`` When I started 13 years ago , vegan to feed me , everything was much more difficult , '' the New Zealanders can find a development : `` You must talk to the people , they . ''
`` If enough , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , '' he hopes .
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the galley in Mannheim or café bird free .
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu .
Basically , vegan dishes for everyone .
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of .
`` Meat dishes are exclusive , and in the truest sense of the word , because they are different from , '' says Proctor .
`` If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way , from the outset , '' says Proctor .
But the shopping veganer products can be a little difficult at the beginning .
Especially when you learn to understand that the additives in animal peanuts as color donors can leave seems to comply with the ethics with so many hurdles and traps quickly .
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book : `` Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives , '' explains the many ingredients , but the food is also .
`` Gradually developed a scanner and knows the signs and logos , '' it is sometimes better to do than small steps to stop or to stumble , `` says Proctor .
The vegan , he is an important moral signal , to raise awareness .
Perhaps he ca n't quite that playing his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits .

Ben Greenman : Ten years New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America : Nearly a hundred years ago began the artist Frank Fay , who worked as a Starboys at the Palace Theatre on Broadway , so that , to tell the crowd jokes in the form of a conversation .
Over the years , the Fays innovation , as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival .
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the stand-up institution Caro Lines , the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters .
`` Most of these headliner began at Caroline 's and were always successful , until they were known to act in a club , '' said Hirsch .
We have designed this festival , so that we can continue to work with them .
This year 's event , there are appearances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher , as well as of `` Stand Up for Heroes , '' an annual music and comedy fundraising event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden , among other things , Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby .
With the festival is also the world of comedy .
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year , have become more unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller television channels like Comedy Central , FX and Spike .
Nick Kroll was known as a sitcom in the cable TV ( ironically schlüpfrige fantasy football series `` the League '' on FXX ) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central .
Jenny Slate was both `` Saturday Night Live '' and `` parks and Recreation '' part of the occupation , although she is best known for their viral video series `` Marcel the Shell with Shoes On . ''
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , ironic , focused on racial issues W. Kaumau Bell ) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .
The largest visitor attraction of the festival is an interview : David Steinberg speaks with Larry David .
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has developed into a prestigious television and film director , as well as an unofficial comedy historian .
From 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a television programme entitled `` Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg '' in TV land .
The meeting will take place in the middle of the Town Hall in Manhattan .
`` The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry 's entire work , '' said Steinberg .
He told me that if he is here , he sometimes through the alley between two buildings and thinks : Hey , if I lose all my money , then maybe I live here .

A black box in the car ?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system , and believe the solution to be found in a small black box , the space in the dashboard of each car .
The devices , which record and report the information to the authorities , the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the federal states to review the outdated system of financing American roads .
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances .
Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups and that the government of the small boxes to record mileage - and , possibly , where they were driven and then use the information for the calculation of modest tax .
The Tea Party is appalled .
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a series of data protection concerns .
But while Congress can not agree on a course of action , several states wait no longer .
They are looking at how they can switch to a system over the next ten years , in which drivers pay per mile driven .
Thousands of drivers have the tachograph , some of which are equipped with GPS tracking , already tested .
This really is a must for our country .
`` There is nothing that we will only use may be , '' said Hasan Ikhrata , executive director of the Southern California Assn . of government , which is planning a record of driven miles in all California motorists in the federal state in 2025 .
The way we pay these taxes , will change .
The technology is there .
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump is broke .
But in America is no longer as much fuel as before .
Cars use less gasoline .
The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per liter ) has not increased for 20 years .
Politicians do not dare to high fuel prices , raising the tax by a penny .
`` The gas tax is simply not sustainable , '' says Lee Munnich , an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota .
The federal government has recently 500 cars with black boxes , which are tested a mileage-based payment system .
`` This is the most sensible alternative , in the long term , '' he said .
Bureaucrats call it as a mileage-based user fee .
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions to be reduced .
The Californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies that the ambitious , statutory objectives of the federal state on climate change .
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also declared that he is the most viable long-term alternative .
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are taken with the idea to drivers pay zurückgelegter route .
`` This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole , '' said Adrian Moore , vice president for policy at the Reason .
People pay directly for what they get .
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of mileage-based billing .
The US Senate last year approved a $ 90 million expensive pilot project , which includes 10,000 cars .
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the thrust and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas , the people who in everyday life , often many miles on the way to work or in the city .
Several states and cities move on their own in this direction .
The most active is Oregon , which is currently enlists 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country .
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the federal government .
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .
New York City also is considering .
Illinois is testing it in a limited way with trucks .
And the I- 95 Coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently studying how to introduce the change .
The concept is not a universal hit .
In Nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices , motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue its every move .
`` Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem , '' said Alauddin Khan , director of strategy and product management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada .
The people did not want it .
As the trial started , the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website : `` It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in mature monitoring devices . ''
There was no need to build a huge , bulky technological infrastructure , which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology , with which the state can collect the mileage , but not exactly when and where .
Thus , Khan , the public would be some .
The hunt for this technology has some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California .
The company is not originally started to help states in the taxation of drivers .
Rather , it was their goal to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance , in which drivers based on the basis of miles .
But the devices are also tested for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information , which are regularly uploaded via modem .
`` People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , '' said Ryan Morrison , managing director of True Mileage .
In some of these public pilot programs big mistakes have been made .
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
In Oregon , the planners are experimenting with to give drivers a number of choices .
You can opt for a device with or without GPS .
Or they can choose any device and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all the inhabitants of the federal state driven miles .
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by the devices with more features than with little .
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation , which is also pay parking fees , insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data are collected by other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams .
`` Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system , motivated to participate , '' says a planning document of the city .
Some traffic planners , however , are wondering whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge distraction .
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by simply increasing the fuel tax .
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline , will be imposed , so that they also pay a fair share .
`` There is no need for an operation , if an aspirin is enough , '' said Randy Rentschler , director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission .
If we do that , hundreds of millions of motorists are concerned about their privacy and many other things .

Germany 's biggest country church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor .
Background is a possible priest shortage of priests , the Evangelical-Lutheran country church Hanover expects that will halve the number of currently around 1,800 pastor and pastors to present situation until 2030 .
The profession is very attractive to young people of today , the and offer good prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Protestant press service .
It is attractive to determine the work and daily .
With Burfien instructed the country 's church for the first time , a pastor at a place to inspire young people to study theology .
Currently , fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating from high school to study theology .
Burfien leads back to the process of secularisation : `` God 's voice is quiet , the world . ''
It is the profession of great freedom and diversity .
I am Mr my calendar and my priorities , where it is important to me .
Pastors could be very close to the people .
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .
Certainly will pay more in the free economy , but theologians would have a secure employer .
This brings the young people of today , it is not just a career , but a meaningful work .
According to the church , which includes three-quarters of Lower Saxony , currently around 60 pastors per year in retirement .
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology student start their Vikariat .
In sparsely populated peripheral regions such as the resin , Emsland or Wendland could in the future it will be difficult to fill posts .
Burfien wants to hold study days for young people , among other things , and also invite celebrities who have studied theology .
The studies offer a broad education .
You can even be Federal President .

On the border between Mexico and the United States , investigators have discovered a `` super-tunnel '' for drug smuggling and .
As the US customs authorities , was the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity , railway tracks and a ventilation system .
Three suspects were arrested , seized eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine .
The tunnel was , according to the data has not yet been taken .
`` These cartels are stupid if they think they can get away by digging under the radar , '' said the general prosecutor of the Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where it was discovered at the end of the tunnel .
At the drug gangs assured Duffy : `` If you continue to build such tunnels and trying to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money . ''
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-running battle against the drug cartels .
Since 2006 , more than 77 , 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with the drug-related crime .
Constructed by experts
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators estimate that it was designed by architects and engineers , and that the construction took about a year .
The track was so that they could be used electrically powered cars .
On the Mexican side of the access in a building that is 80 meters away from the border .
According to authorities , a ladder leads 20 meters in depth to the tunnel entrance .
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters wide .
He would have to encourage illegal immigration to the United States .
Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine-Fund .
The third , a Mexican , was taken because of the confiscated marijuana .
All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment , officials said .
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , it said at the press conference in San Diego .
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction .
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels .
This shows the `` desperation '' of drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug searches in San Diego .
They would do everything to get to the United States .
The detainees were given no details , at least one is Mexicans , it said .
They must count on prison sentences of up to ten years .

When the horse experts in droves in Cardiff met to select the horse of the year , they knew that a rat race .
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland .
The kid , who is not even in kindergarten , and only a few months ago , made his first steps , and his Shetland pony toffee trotted only loosely through three rounds and got the first prize - 30 adult opponents .
The inseparable pair , both of the same size , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style at the annual competition , which is organized by the Sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring .
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony , which would be far beyond his age .
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality .
Fenton had toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and practiced every day with the Shetland pony .
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : `` Fenton and toffee are a great team . ''
They had to compete against the entire field of competitors and went with gold trophy and rosette .
It was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with toffee , and we were all excited when he won .
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , who for more than ten years .
Howells said : `` The whole audience was hooked and all have cheered and applauded him . ''
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena , and although he looked so tiny , he has done a fantastic job .
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens that he cares .
As it is launched , it will not be long until he is on the `` horse of the Year '' - and I am sure he will do well .
A spokesman for the annual horse show said : `` Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ''
Together , they are a great team .
The jury considered Fenton and toffee how well they fared and in the Vorführring .
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader - and Fenton and toffee were the best in the ring .
I am sure that Fentons sweet clothing has played its part , the truly fit perfectly .

Rapist in South Africa : Twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa on Friday to two life sentences for the perpetrators .
It reported the broadcaster SABC .
The victim was later died from the effects of serious injuries .
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of the crime at the beginning of the week .
The act sparked outrage across the country .
The then 21-year-old was raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .
14 hours , the doctors fought for the survival of the victim , but to no avail .
The sight of young people was so dire that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance .
Qana had admitted during the trial , in the Tatnacht with Booysen in a bar .
He also admitted that they have beaten and raped , but he denied being responsible for the death of the girl .
The police initially assumed several offenders , however , dismissed two suspects from detention , because the evidence against them was not adequate .
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Qana was alone at the time of the attack .
Rape in South Africa as : every year there are about 64,000 charges of sexual violence .
That is almost ten times as much as in Germany , but with 82 million people , has more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .

Parents can choose children `` ''
Germany is the first European nation , in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia .
Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned male or female .
Under the new law , parents must be no more sex for such children , but `` vague '' or `` not '' on the birth certificate .
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents , so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for a gender assignment in newborns , and to combat discrimination against the people .
A intersexuelle person , according to BBC years later said : `` I am neither man nor woman . ''
I remain a patchwork quilt , which was created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year , either as a boy or a girl .
They belong to the , a group that fall under the diagnosis `` sexual differentiation disorder '' ( DSD ) , an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes , gonads ( ovaries or testicles ) or unusually developed genitals .
Wallis Simpson was perhaps more .
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the United States , you should use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child , before you decide - if any - for an operation .
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said that the new German law `` blade for a good cause . ''
Sexual interaction children represent an ethical dilemma .
`` Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical procedure , but for most children are not , '' he said .
It could be a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the developing identity .
The scientific data about how a child develops at all his gender identity , are not very accurate .
No one knows why it happens .
It is like the mystery of why people are gay .
In a report to the European Commission in 2011 , it says , sexual people are transsexual and transgender people , because their status is not gender-related , but by their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female exclusively , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .
These properties were in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structures and hormones .
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced intersexuelle and transgender people in professional life and about the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .
Not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp .
In the meantime , it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults on official documents , male , female or `` third sex '' reported .
In June , Australians Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) as the world 's first `` gender-free '' person , after a court had granted the maintenance of a `` unspecified '' gender status .
German identity cards besides M and W , in a third allocation , in addition to the future , X for sexually , the Ministry of the Interior .
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , as a news story on France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the `` gender theory '' should be removed from school textbooks .
The US Catholic Online website has also spoken out against the German law , saying : `` If the world is being dragged into a new state , where the sex is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we twist two other pillars of civilization . ''
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told baby zone , it would be better if babies will be assigned to a sex at birth .
`` The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your child , '' she said of the parents ' website .
Children need stability and security .
Historically , children who were born with both male and female parts , called Hermaphroditen , after the Greek god who had both sexes .
Ten years ago , the medicine regarded sex as something that you can wipe out and then rebuild .
But in the meantime , questioned the ethical foundations of an operation now is the gender identity , and that doctors can be wrong , because they do not know how the child at the turn of the sex of their allocation .
`` In the middle of the 20th century , we called this a '' psychiatric emergency , `` said Drescher .
If such a child was born , then called the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who took the view that sex is malleable .
He coined the term `` gender identity '' and argued that social and environmental initiatives , such as the parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as to whether a person is male or female .
But in one under the title `` John / Joan '' case from 1966 his theories have been controversial .
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to neuter the child and to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl .
`` Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , but he did not , '' says Drescher .
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .
With 38 but he committed suicide .
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who practice this model .
But in the 1990s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of this sex operations to the public , who are `` not happy with the result . ''
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old writer from Montana , who was born with XY male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris , or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life `` as a man .
So external body and testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976 , and he was brought up as a girl .
At the age of 12 , he received female hormones .
`` I knew that I am not a girl , '' he said on ABCNews.com
I was unhappy , but it was really hard to ask questions .
At the age of 18 , he should receive a vaginoplasty .
But because he was depressed and knew that something was amiss , he asked for his medical records .
What he found was shocking .
I was sterilised am birth - and no one has ever told me .
Bruce was born with a DSD , through his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals .
After he had told the truth , he moved back to the male identity , received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts .
The operation , he has become infertile .
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for sexual people are perceived as normal .
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , managing director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice , worries that the German law `` could '' encourage stamping and .
`` Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child , not to '' , `` she explained .
We fear that favours intervention .
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait .
But we still do not know how the law will impact , so we can only speculate .
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because `` it allows adult recognition as a third sex . ''
`` Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , '' she said .
The German law is about the allocation at birth .
This is not a fight , which should be small children at this time .
When they grow up , they can decide on their bodies .
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast radio login from Pitt , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the German law `` authorize '' both parents and children .
Baratz 's daughter , Katie , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz .
Because of the target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics .
She has a vagina , but no uterus and ovaries .
Today , Katie 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a co-worker in the child psychiatry .
Although she is infertile , but hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .
`` The law gives parents room , so they do not have to make hasty decisions , '' said Baratz .
It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they write `` male '' or `` female '' .
In this way , everything is in order , the child and loves it .
It was a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness .
And we must not rush to make an operation that will not .
`` This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that the parents , because they believe that they would not do the right thing , '' she explained .
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex , which is more suited to him - and it is wonderful .
This will be able to make the decision themselves .

Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark ?
A British businessman has developed the first in the dark luminous ice – with the help of jellyfish .
Charlie Francis , the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous bounties .
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese researchers artificially bright protein .
The ice cream responds to eat with the tongue , making the pH value in the protein and the lights .
Chris says that the response to the heat in the mouth and the more you licks , the lighter it .
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company `` Lick Me I 'm Delicious , '' says : `` The product is unbelievable , but still at a very early stage of production , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ''
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral pH value .
If the mouth warms the protein , the pH and the ice .
We have tested it in recent months , and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market , because it has this wonderful Leuchteffekt .
It is probably the most expensive ice cream , which I have ever made , because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold .
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds .
But it tastes delicious .
His experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors , including beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
But his latest creation is to be more ambitious .
He says : `` I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ''
That in itself is impossible because of the refraction , which is caused by the ice crystals of ice cream , but I suspect that we will find a way to do it .
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish , which are produced by Chinese scientists artificially

Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .
After the completion of phase 2 , there will be links to Manchester and Leeds .
In June , the government revised the estimated cost for the construction of the high-speed rail link between London and the north of England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds .
The British government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , HS2 Ltd has to look for other routes capacity and travel time improvements in northern England and Scotland .
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less in the end of Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .
Baroness Kramer said : `` Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network , the United Kingdom and its cities closer together . ''
We go ahead with HS2 , because it brings enormous benefits .
Without it , we are facing a crisis in our rail network .
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which will improve thanks to HS2 .
The Scottish Secretary Alistair campaign commented : `` Today 's announcement is good news for Scotland . ''
On behalf of the Scottish Government called Keith Brown campaign to `` unequivocally '' for the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network .
Mr Brown said : `` The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but also the economic strength of Scotland an argument for high-speed rail links across the UK . ''

New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking warfare
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime of nicotine addiction .
Before tests on humans will be needed before tests , which can take several years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York , said the first results are good .
`` We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried and tried to stop all methods available on the market , but saw that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , '' said Cornell .
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies .
The virus infected selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .
The antibodies to the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which is a smoker no nicotine .
In experiments vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered retained their normal level of activity .
Mice without vaccination against a `` break '' would have taken , the researchers said , a sign that the nicotine have achieved their brains .
The experiments are described in the journal Science in translational medicine .
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .
The vaccines had to be given to maintain the Antikörperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical .
But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower , because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories .
As Professor Crystal said , could be a future vaccine for people , if he is sure to be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , and thus prevent nicotine addiction .
But it is more likely that smokers would use him to stop .
`` They know that if they begin to smoke , they feel because of the nicotine vaccine is no more , and that helps them to give up the habit , '' he explained .
British scientists said the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that it is still a need for further research .

The two dealers would be the first RBS staff who have been suspended in the widening investigation of the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business .
The bank made no comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities .
`` Our investigations are continuing on this issue and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , '' said the bank two weeks ago .
Last month , people close to the situation said that the RBS the records of e-mails and instant messages , and were sent to a former trader at the British regulator , the Financial Conduct Authority , have passed .
The trader , Richard Usher , had left the RBS in 2010 and is now leave from his current position as a European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan .

None of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing .
The instant message group of Usher were bankers at Barclays and Citigroup , said people close to the situation .
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of their employees , after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that they will examine the alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have denied transactions in the currency market .

A senior trader said that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the growing use of internal platforms by banks that `` one with very low ticket prices can affect the market . ''
The news came on the same day , when Credit Suisse announced this week that it had terminated a distributor of London Exchange Traded Funds offices , after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year .
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with them .
`` We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is under control , '' said Credit Suisse .

Children should be myths and legends as `` role models for life , '' says the author .
The stories of Thor showed that `` brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , '' and the Arthur legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .
However , many of the myths are `` far too wild , too offensive and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught in schools , '' , which is why Crossley-Holland for a `` careful selection '' age just works .
`` I think it is wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education , '' he said .
I have already proposed a plan for twenty years .
He added that authors and teachers who were `` overly didactic , '' children `` shut down completely , '' because in entertaining stories , the `` subliminal messages . ''
Crossley-Holland , Beowulf translated from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , said : `` You can pursue certain intentions , but we should keep them in the background . ''
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults , and an author who writes for children , is the need to give hope .
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending , but there is an inherent sense of good and evil .
This must be presented subliminally , be revealed by the history and not explained .
This is the old story of showing rather than telling .

I am looking for a new home for my husband and me for some time now , .
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .
The reason , however , is not a spider phobia , but the concern , at the age of the many steps to the house and no longer in the apartment , she says .
Moreover , since a meniscus tears operation , the Mittfünfzigerin experienced what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor .
Recently published a book of her on 'living in old age - What home form is the best for me ? '. ``

They also know that it is one of the few people who actually deal with the issue of 'living in old age .
Most of it , as long as possible .
They are , 'she says humorous .
Only when the suffering is really great , you think .
Then it may be too late , `` said Ries .
In her book , the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age .
`` What chooses living form , however , is always an individual decision , '' she explained .
D i e solution , it is not for the ages .
Even those who can afford the residency in Tuscany or Brittany , should always consider that he could also be ill .
And : `` Without a good knowledge of the language vereinsame in Dolce Vita , '' the book author Aussiedlungs willing to consider .
Among their models are classic models of care , alternative forms of housing , or the oft-quoted pensioners - WG .
At the age , everyone has his tics and quirks
`` For me it would be a residential community , but nothing , '' she says with a wink .
Certainly not as a student house with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
`` In the age you need his retreat , '' Ries .
A senior living community can still work , the author does not want to .
It must then differently than in the classic students WG .
And sometimes you just want to his rest , `` she believes .
With this view , at least , it is not alone in the capital .
`` The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it is in their own home , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the country 's capital .
The department advises people around the theme 'ageing ' .
That is why older people would often just inconvenience and restrictions , only to be able to remain in that environment , it is the experience of the Stiftung Warentest .
Today , there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free .
Ries recommends all dealing with the age of their house or apartment to check , and not just the best craftsmen .
Today , there is also the age just reconstruction specialists .
Even in the apartment for one or the other , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , clarifies the interior designer .
But it is not always the existing apartment age and thus accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .
This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries .
While you could install a stair lift inside the apartment , but the road paved with stairs to the , would be a far greater obstacle .
It will continue to search until it has found the ideal property for herself and her husband .

Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders , as in the past , companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers , and hundreds have stopped .
