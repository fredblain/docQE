Councillor decides unanimously : No Kioskneubau at St Goarer 's Rhine bank
Normally , the St. Goarer investment projects by tradespeople with Kusshand - the retail sector in the heartland is considered to be significantly expanding .
However , the City Council unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkons under construction .
`` In principle , we welcome new tradespeople , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this kiosk does not fit in , '' explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU group .

Podolski Takes With 'Gala ' After Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey .
In Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
For the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is taking place in Turkey .
Before the duel of arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski 's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : `` Business as usual '' is required .
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the crash in July , the government argued that the everyday lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected .
However , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed for the coup attempt .
It does not stop even before football .
Against former heavy icker Hakan Sükür , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant .
So the South Coast , now living in America , is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
South Coast is said to be supporters of preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
While the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact this has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks .
The late-night `` democracy guards '' in public places across the country declared Erdogan to quit on Wednesday .
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan .
Especially fans of the Besiktas Workers ' Club are traditionally not among the president 's friends .
But what unites the bulk of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups .
That 's where even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas .
In the postseason `` Gala '' there will be a special return to Lukas Podolski .
Cologne proved his sporting value in the previous season : With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31-year-old finished his first season as his club 's top scorer .
In the final game against Fenerbahce , he scored the 1-0 victory .
The newspaper `` Fanatics '' cheered him : `` He was the best in the place . ''
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy .
Thanks to `` Poldi , '' the disappointing season for the record holder found a conciliatory conclusion .
After the runner-up K.o in the Champions League , the `` Lions '' also scored early in the Europa League .
In the Süper Lig , it was only six .
The season was not good .
The trophy was the only way to win something .
`` That 's what we 've done and that 's the most important thing , '' Podolski said .
For champions Besiktas , the game year ran better .
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez , who laid the base for the 14th title with 26 seasons as a Southern League goalscorer .
This is also the reason fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old 's return .
After the coup attempt , the Gomez , who was under contract with AC Florence , announced that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his Euro holiday .
`` If Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , '' the trade magazine `` Kicker '' quoted club leader Fikret Orman as saying .
To do that , however , the striker would have to be willing to give up on about a third of his $ 7.5 million annual salary , Orman stated clearly : `` His salary at Florence we ca n't pay . ''

Future of Portland 's melting down due to lifting of energy contract questionable
The future of Portland 's aluminium smelting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - is at stake , as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts , according to the supplying energy company .
That move followed the government 's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the facility .
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November .
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa 's plant in Portland are at stake .
No fewer than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
In addition , there could be knock-on effects , as the melting process consumes about 10 per cent of the total power generation Victorias consumed .
In 2014 , Alcoa completed the Point Henry melting , which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alcoa 's melting in Portland is losing money and risking closure .
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AGL , which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley , said that it assumes that three other owners will terminate their contracts .
The plant is in the majority possession of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina , of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japan 's Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares .
`` AGL assumes the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , '' the company said .
AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called `` backup operations , '' which should have come into effect from November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017 .
`` As a result , AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17 , '' the electricity supplier said .
Any potential impact on AGL 's revenue from FY18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL said that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual total of $ 187 million in `` expectation of a termination . ''
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts did not impair the `` ability of Alcoas ... to do the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting . ''
The US company said it completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which should have come into effect from November this year , even though it is still guilty of an explanation as to why it resigned from the contract .
Analysts are warning of the industry 's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle .
Referring to the analysts ' statements earlier this week , Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year .
If both plants were to disappear from the market , that would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [ electricity market ] .
And for us as generators , that would n't be good , `` he said .

Amid the Rage of the Olympics , the Zen of trampolins
Wherever you are , how late it is , it 's the Olympics .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspiration .
It 's as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning baton that is passed from the bravado to swimmer to Turner to the triathlete .
You ca n't turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour 's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the battle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there is Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who is at the Olympics for the first time and a woman 's swarm with greats , could well have been among those well-known names to be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer , Turner or even Flood .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline .
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event .
Further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : Air pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
We will always have breast swimming and may rule it for a long time .
But if I 'm likely to make arguments for my particular darling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
Although the trampoline jump has already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it has been so sparse the last 16 years that many of the ones I had interviewed did n't know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
This could also be regional ignorance .
Although the US sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and , by 2012 , had an athlete who made it to the finals .
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share for women .
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline jumping has some outsider charm , in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school than the one for the Olympics .
At this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , just an earthbound enthusiast .
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonish tremor of his never-ending cloudy impact - but also the grace of the gym and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it .
The word `` trampoline '' comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as `` springboard . ''
Up-and-coming victors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and having to make a series of falling movements ( turning , lifting and saltos ) before landing on their feet .
They are assessed according to execution , difficulty and `` flight time , '' according to the official Olympic programme .
Two-time athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
Medal hopes must go on in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down in the playground .
They are chasing not only the finish line or the output wall , but also another derisive target in television broadcasting : That of the world or the Olympic cords .
The purposeful pursuit is nobel , admirable , even fanatical - and it 's enough to even stir a bystander to tears .
But it 's also what I feel even while watching these games as something tiring .
Of this , the trampoline offers breathing space .
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above .
A forward movement is not the goal .
He or she bounces off , seemingly weightless like an astronaut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back up .
Again , there is a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no frenzied attack on the target , no wobble into the distance , just the dreamlike , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It 's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
The women 's qualifying and finals will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
Amid the Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult .
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved through the angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently suggested , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his after-air , new fan base .

Snapchat 'anime ' effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired , but some observers say it 's insensitive to breeds .
With its filter tool , Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already borders on the absurd .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are outspoken , self-twisted tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day .
All missteps are sent to the public .
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused that the app would promote Blackface or propagate white skin as a beauty sideal .
When , this week , some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes , false teeth and darkened cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - `` yellowing . ''
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature .
The company offered an apology : The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters rather than a caricature of Asians .
But outsiders who have experienced racists reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés .
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison .
In an email , Grace Sparapani , a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely circulated about the photos , said that the filter was `` vulnerable and , to say the least , unpleasant . ''
She added that `` it 's difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof , but that the yellow face has been drawn into the derogatory extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural stumbling blocks .
American culture seems to be implicated in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
And Snapchat 's large audience of young people - who are in terms of race various than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
If one of Snapchat 's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , `` so it 's much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be , '' 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account urged others to do the same .
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview , she said that she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the largely white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
`` Either she does n't have a diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so they can make such decisions , '' said the Chinese-American Zhu , `` or they have people with other skin colours working there but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say what to do about it . ''
Others share their opinions , a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered .
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a staff officer focused on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts .
For her part , Zhu said that she will have her Snapchat account closed and added , `` I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K . ''

Frankie Dettori reaches out on predilection his 3,000th win at Newmarket
Dettori spins champagne after a double at Newmarket , which brings him 3,000th profit
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday .
He put on predilection , which is trained by John Gosden , on his local circuit with his second win of the night a milestone .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
The three-time winner Dettori , who won on Ghayyar before , said : `` It 's something special . ''
I 'm very emotional because my family is here too
I 'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago .
It 's not a big meeting , it 's not Royal Ascot - it 's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am relieved and very humble .
Dettori takes the cheer as he picks up on predilection victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernism and it 's no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved before him .
He has style and is strong , but it 's his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
He is a fantastic ambassador for race , his enthusiasm and charisma has thrilled fans for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he 'd already picked up 6,000 gains if he were n't just a weekend and big-tournament jockey !
Frankie has already ridden nearly 30 years of winners in GB , which is great .
He has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that , he 's an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From flying finishes to Flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the showcase of the British flat race for two decades .
It was nerve-wracking .
A slew of big-tournament wins , including his famous `` Glorrich Seven '' in 1996 in Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
Three years ago , he initially faced difficulties when he returned from his six-month ban , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his two-fliers and return to his best form .
And he 's still a long way from the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .

Cats react more sensitive than hangover on cries of juveniles
Biologists have been investigating in Hanover what effect the cries of cat babies have on adult animals .
To their surprise , this also left the males not cold - however , in contrast to the females , they always behaved the same .
Female cats can recognize the grounding level of cat babies at the mistress of the little ones .
They respond by 10 per cent faster on laughs of kittens picking up in great distress , according to scientists from the Animal Medical College and the Medical University of Hanover ( MHH ) .
Hangovers also respond to the cries of kittens - but always the same .
`` Apparently , the acoustic differences between the mistress of less and severely erratic juveniles for males are either imperceptible or not significant , '' said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH .
She is the author of the study , published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology .
In a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten 's screams differed with the urgency of their need for help .
There were a total of nine adult hangovers and eight kittens from the MHH 's livestock .
They were played to a cries of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings .
On the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more erratic kittens , which were additionally uplifted .
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample .
`` All the females , even the ones who have not yet had their own offspring , responded differentiated to the screams , '' Konerding said .
They turned more quickly to the speaker when that cries of the very errant kitten played off .
This ability may be incensed or developed with sexual maturity .
`` One surprise was that the males reacted at all , '' the biologist said .
In the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises several times in humans .
Also , some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the biologist Marina Scheumann reported .

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass exodus
`` If you do n't adapt and Erdogan praises , sit on packed suitcases , '' says the chairman of the Gülen-nearby Foundation Dialogue and World , Ercan Karakoyun .
The Kurdish community of Germany reckons in the short term with tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term , it could even become `` a few hundred thousand , '' believes the association 's president , Ali Toprak .
Because of the crackdown by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass exodus to Germany .
`` In the short term , I expect tens of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , '' says the association 's chairman Ali Toprak of the `` World '' Friday .
Because the government has already covered Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago , 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey are on the run .
After the thwarted coup , there would still be secular and opposition ethnic Turks .
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey .
`` It can not be that a state that even takes in refugees produces refugees in their own country , '' Toprak said .
The union chief lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in alevitic cities .
As a result , Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
`` They are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years , '' said Toprak , who is also a CDU member .
The union chief called for the federal government to `` position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters . ''
In Germany , too , a `` witch hunt '' is taking place against Erdogan 's critics .
I do n't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition activists .
The branding as a Gülen supporter wiped out teachers and other academics ' professional existence .
`` Those who do n't adapt and Erdogan praises are sitting on packed suitcases , by the way , the Kemalists and secularists , '' said Ercan Karakoyun , chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Foundation of Dialogue and Education , the `` World . ''
As the newspaper reported , citing figures from the federal interior ministry , the Turks already represented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
On the cut-off date of 30 June , this figure was 11,386 people , accounting for almost 29 % of all those eligible for asylum ( 39,625 ) .
This survey does not include those fleeing war , poverty or lack of perspective .
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , in other words from the state side , individually persecuted .

Traveller Ian Wright shakes his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a guidebook
A British traveller subjected his immune system and strangereflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe .
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk snapped his wake on a euro note , a railing at Piccadilly Circus , a flush button of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system .
Before licking each object , he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to engage in .
But the experiment , which was filmed under the title `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' brought some surprising results to daylight .
The thought of leaking the flush button of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely repellent , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
On his journey through Europe , Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria , as well as about his own health .
Fortunately , nothing left him livid , more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth .
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
From public vows at train stations to flushing buttons of toilets , the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film , he told me : `` Already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film , he definitely lived up to his reputation .
The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
His trial cut showed a luminosity figure of over 4,000 units .
In comparison , the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after her Luminometer number was over 4,000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish maker of dairy products Valio produced the travel film `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' which shows the bacteria count in different places such as the bathroom
In the film , he says : `` This comes down to the worst thing I 've got in a toilet , close . ''
There is nothing worse than that !
I 'm not going to lick anything here because it 's disgusting here indoors .
`` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio .
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus , which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Valio 's senior Venice president for snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` We really wanted to offer consumers something new .
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics .
We carried out crazy brainstorms that ended with us saying `` Lass us Ian . ''
They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom HAKALA , who directed the film , added : `` Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had yelped some of the things I instructed him to lick , just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film . ''
Of course , there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult .
I 'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . '
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio , 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria .

Why We Need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
That 's what I imagine under the women 's Olympic team in the turkey and that for more than a reason .
First , I 've been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
And second , this team has three turners , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren `` Laurie '' Hernandez , who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color .
The structure of this team , which is Aly Raisman , who is Jewish and Madison Kocian , who is Catholic , makes everyone proud .
This team finally reflects the United States .
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
In the last four years , number one among female turners has been an African-American .
Last year , Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
That shows strength .
At the last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered .
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected , yet masterful gymastic routines .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We 're seeing the top of this sport , but that 's how gym classes across the country do n't look out of place .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all struck the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team .
They are the `` last five '' because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team , and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee .
But the reality is that turkey is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gym clubs , which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , deployment , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their Turner and families ) .
The majority of these gym clubs are in affluent suburbs that can support the business .
In these clubs , Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , trainer of Laurie Hernandez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the turkey .
We need to provide the communities of countless , young girls inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie , a more affordable and easily accessible gym .
I started my gym foundation of 20 years .
At my events , we have offered free and affordable turkeys in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and Hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
In September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer youth high-quality turkeys that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Turns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for educational and professional success .
It 's the inspiration of this team to get thousands of young girls to be interested in the turkey and that 's great .
It 's so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
This is such an exciting time .
Thanks Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of `` Girl Power '' by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thank you , fass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

Adblock Plus , Facebook in `` cat and mouse game '' regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circumvent ad blocking are tantamount to a `` cat and mouse game . ''
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad lockdowns on its desktop site , Adblock Plus released a blog post announcing that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change coding regarding its advertising ads to make it more difficult to detect the detection of which part of the site is advertising .
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes .
In a blog post , the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that `` this kind of back-and-forth fight has already been underway between the antimised open source community and the revellers since the invention of ad blockers , '' and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's largest company has entered the fight on social media is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry .
Globally , according to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe , some 200 million people use ad blockers ; nearly four times as much in 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile terminals , mobile advertising makes up 84 per cent of advertising revenue Facebooks .
The company has it on ad blockers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook 's mobile app for the social network and Instagram , a spokesman said .
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook considers the investment of such a step to be worthwhile .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its `` ad preference tool '' to allow people to have more control over advertising aimed at them .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that Adblock 's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
`` For users , this does not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , '' a spokesperson told Facebook in an email message .
Ad blockers are a blunt means , which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people 's hands .

Community legal centres point out 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country 's aid needs are dismissed annually by community legal centres , while the industry is grappling with the impact of further funding cuts on already overstretched transactions .
In Queensland , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence , and those who do not have funds for unfair Deloitte and the like - are being turned away at their request for free legal advice and legal counsel .
Legal services of the community , which are already overly busy , are getting ready for further cuts .
As of June next year , it is envisaged that these legal centres will lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
The director of the community centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centres found that thousands of people are already being turned away each year .
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government 's decision .
`` Queensland 's community legal centres are chronically underfunded , meaning thousands of people are being turned away from important services you need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crushing debts , families who go through divides , workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows they ca n't get the help they need .
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017 , meaning thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
We call on the attorney general and federal regulators , as well as senators of Queensland George Brandis , to immediately lift these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
Last year , the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
It is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their client communities , and that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work .

Restful night : Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening , you walk around forever , at night you wake up for hours , in the morning it is no longer possible to think of sleep well before the Weckerringing .
This is far from relaxing .
After all , you are in good company with such problems : According to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
What about sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
There are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can be based on a variety of causes , says Hans-Günter Weeß , Executive Director of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine .
What you understand landly underneath , though , is the Insomnie , that is , an entry and sleep disorder .
It is precisely this sleep that many people find unsatisfactory or insufficient , says Jens Wagenknecht , a member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony .
What 's behind sleep disorders ?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex .
This can include organic , psychological or behavioural factors , as well as medicines .
Not infrequently , the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
`` Very early waking is especially common in a depression , '' Weeß says .
And it may be that different factors are interdependent .
If you have a bandwagon , for example , can be bad , wake up every two to three hours , and may start to grate about everyday problems and worries , Weeß gives an example .
This leads to strain , and sleep is no longer possible .
When should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders ?
If you do n't sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day , you should go to the doctor , Weeß advises .
The impairment can look quite different : One is cut off , tired , unspent , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily delightful , has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache .
To ease the sleep disorder , it 's important to find out their causes .
Treatment options include behavioural changes , cognitive behavioral therapy , or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Low-level sleep doctors hardly exist in Germany , says Prof. Ingo Fietze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin .
Therefore , in the case of sleep problems , you should first contact the family doctor , Weeß advises .
The can deal with investigations into whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should go to the sleep lab , and what happens there ?
To study in the sleep lab , physicians advise , for example , in snoring with breathing enforcers , at sick day fatigue , at sleep converters or if you do n't find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fietze explains .
You do n't really have to prepare for the inquiry .
You should spend the day normal .
`` Just please do n't do a midday sleep , '' Fietze says .
After dressing down , you go to bed at his normal time .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , one wears a nose brille , a chest strap and a faucet on the finger .
In addition , a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping .
How can people get to grips with the problems ?
There are quite a lot of job cuts where you can start for a better sleep .
What counts is : Regular sleep and rest periods , not being in bed for too long , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to fall asleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately , and that is not conducive at all .

Salzburg 's `` West Side Story '' with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival will present the `` West Side Story '' with Tony and Maria as a tragic daredevil , similar to Romeo and Juliet .
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
A musical conquers Salzburg : The `` West Side Story , '' Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece .
The artistic director , Cecilia Bartoli , wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of the Classic and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
In the orchestral dig the Simón Bolívar orchestra led by the venezonal conductor Gustavo Dudamel : `` This music is full of rhythm , '' he shrugs .
We always say that it is very Latin American .
There are a lot of Latin American ingredients in their pace and their tune .
It 's a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein 's music in our blood !
In this staging , Bartoli plays an older Mary .
She remembers with grudge to her loved one with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
The role of Maria has always fascinated me .
First , because she 's musically extraordinary !
And then there would be Mariah 's personality .
She says it in her song : `` I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and witty and bright . ''
So she is wise , of course , naive , and very passionate .
`` She resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman in , '' laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It 's such an honour for us to work with her .
She 's an immensely generous man .
And Bartoli returns the compliment : `` Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! ''
Conducting is a necessity for him .
You see it in every one of his movements , in his looks , it 's his life !
It 's such a huge opportunity to be able to share this musical experience with him .
We both have a more southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
For American director Philip Wm . McKinley , the `` West Side Story '' is highly topical : `` This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism . ''
Today we have the refugees , at the time the Puertorians went to New York , and the New York residents did n't want them .
It 's the same issues , and they 're just as meaningful today as they were then .
59 years later , the play is still relevant .

Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly : 'It will be better '
Like most 6-year-olds , Edmund Picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
But like the least of his age , Edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother , Elizabeth Picciuto , knew nothing during her pregnancy .
When he first came home , my first thought was , I 'm not able to do that .
I do n't manage that .
I did n't engage in that .
Which is not true at all -- of course you got into it , `` she said .
Her husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund will never be able to recognize them in some circumstances and that he may not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far as to propose to institutionalize him .
`` My first response to that was ' I did n't know that people still do , ' '' explained Picciuto .
Edmund can run with the help of a walking aid .
Edmund could not sit or crawl until his third year of life and he still ca n't speak .
But he is slowly making progress .
He can run with support and bike rides .
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund devised for `` Please sing me something before . ''
`` We bring him sign language , '' Picciuto told CBS News .
But it 's not a typical sign language -- she says . Edmund invented some characters on his own .
Microcephaly has a variety of causes : Genetic as with Edmund , as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy .
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those with the Zikavirus infected .
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked all the time , what will happen ?
What will happen ?
And she still does n't really know .
I have n't asked for the forecast for a long time because I do n't expect them to really tell me anyone .
But Picciuto has a hopeful piece of advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus .
It 's going to be better .
You know it will be better for you .
You will love your child and your child will love you .

De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July , many people were concerned about further attacks .
The state must respond calmly and decisively to terrorist threats .
To be sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists .
If criminals were to leave the country more quickly , however , this adds to the security and strength of popular support for refugee policy .
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals until the 2017 general election .
He also announced a further staffing reinforcement of the security forces , and `` in mid-fourths of magnitude over several years . ''
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be punished again .
Video surveillance is to be improved , gun law revised in such a way as to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet .
The last much-discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be preserved after de Maizière 's words .
However , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions to how to reduce the vulnerability of citizens , he said , referring , for example , to mental health refreshers .
To counter radicalisation of refugees , the minister believes better social care is needed .
Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatised people .
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Darknet ) , de Maizière plans to use covert investigators .
UKIP leader Gabriel said : `` The SPD is willing to talk about anything that helps to further increase security . ''
It is important that the Home Secretary has spoken out clearly against actionism .
`` This was a slap in the face for the executioners in the CDU / CSU , '' Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group ( Friday ) .
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union following a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
He believes that a general ban on full wear is constitutionally problematic .
You ca n't ban everything you reject , and I refuse to wear the burqa .
We can talk about rules , for example , in road transport or for witnesses in court .
Greens leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate offence and ability to act with ever-new anti-terror packages .
Left-wing leader Bernd Riexinger said : `` Fleet spells and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people of this country . ''

Data clutter : So perilous blackmail hackers have their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful .
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America , Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the firms surveyed over the past 12 months have been victims of an attack with extortion software at least once , in part .
In Germany , just under 20 percent of firms were already the target of Ransomware blackmail .
Forty per cent of victims willingly paid the ransoms required by the offenders to be able to re-use the targeted systems and data .
According to the observations of Malwarebytes , the perpetrators are increasingly specialising in attacks in company networks .
If they are successful there , the potentially extortionate ransom is significantly higher than for private users .
`` We are currently seeing an alarmingly rapid evolution of the malicious software , '' explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the `` world . ''
In 2008 , most malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves .
First private users were the target , but the shift to corporate attacks has been alarmingly fast in recent months .
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern : Once on a victim 's computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals in a sustainable manner .
The software then presents the demands of the executors .
To get the end-key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin .
But where the personal photo database is at stake with private users , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
Accordingly , the damage is higher when a Ransomware hits .
Twenty-two per cent of the German firms affected reported sales losses by Ransomware , while 13 per cent even had to interrupt business altogether , in one case people were at risk of death .
In Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records .
`` We always tell the victims : Do not pay , it only promotes the problem , '' explains Kleczynski .
But 80 to 90 per cent of firms that pay will get their data again .
For managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of gridlock in the operation .
The hackers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , F-Secure 's security researchers looked at exploitation surfaces and contact with the executors , and come to the conclusion : The perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to take more money .
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin , target freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free .
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to get their data back unencrypted .
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from Ransomware extortion , the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work , security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos said : `` A single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week . ''
However , it is more likely that there are three or four people .
The programmers then sell their malicious software to the actual executors in the form of a software building box .
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one-off , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
`` Included in the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , looks and branding can be changed , '' says Wisniewski .
The executors are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
So you log into one of the forums underground , buy the set of a criminal and charge another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
Payment is made per infected computer .
`` Usually the criminals then instruct spammers with the spread , '' explains Wisniewski .
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data .
Over 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fend off Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software .
Accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
`` If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful grounding , the perpetrators instead face the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , '' explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski .
As a result , the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
In the future , the perpetrators would also be able to target completely new targets in the Internet of Things .
At the hacking conference Defcon , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control .
In the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom to so many victims .
If the perpetrators then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ransomware could also become an issue in industry 4.0 .

Police : 3 victims shot in serial murder case during music hearing in car
According to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead , who died in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in the first serial killing of Phoenix while they were staying in the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis 's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway , authorities said .
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
Police said that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery , as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 , which was owned by one of the adult victims .
Phoenix Sgt . Jonathan Howard 's police spokesman said that the shootings led investigators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks .
In total , seven people were killed and two others injured , mainly in Hispanic neighborhoods within four months in nine attacks .
`` It is happening in a residential area in front of a house , '' Howard told KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , earlier this month .
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles , including a brown Nissans from the late 1990 `` s , a black BMW from the late 1990 '' s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis 's daughter Maleah still died on the ground .
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
Authorities also released a police report on the shootings , aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed it was the work of the serial killer .
Investigators found patronage and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room .

Queensferry Crossing : Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the north deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife .
It is the first of four closures of the `` cover blowers '' that are nearing completion around each of the bridge 's three towers .
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 oblique ropes .
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Business Secretary Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
He said : `` This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings .
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
In total , nearly 79 % of the entire bridge deck is in their place and the last section of the deck will get a Betonguss for the deck in Rosyth today , meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : `` The first shutter represents a significant milestone in any bridge project .
In this fantastic project , the closure represents a trend-setting high and deep construction .
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expansion of the north tower deck , we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side .
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south .
This was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate activity .
Massive , since the viaduct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3 % .
Tricky because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres .
Fortunately , everything went very well .

Greenland shark : The oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter .
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna .
He was born in 1624 and swims with well over a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland sharks only get up with 150 years of offspring .
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic , and in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 metres .
Only when it gets on , the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a hefty 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robotic with this top speed .
This lifestyle characterised by slowness , however , seems to be a panacea for a high age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science , at least , of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old .
`` Madness , '' comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for vertebrates .
While the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will be stone-aged .
Just lacked the evidence .
Greenland sharks are hard to watch , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
About the lifestyle of Greenland sharks , researchers know correspondingly little .
They measured their slow pace when they replaced six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen .
Prey still make these sharks : In the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a robotic , another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
They may be chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice sea and looking for carcasses that are torched from higher water layers to the bottom .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 off Greenland or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long , while the largest 502 inches measured .
To determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of sharks using the carbon-14 method .
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks , the proteins contained in it are not renewed later .
The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core .
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 `` s , when nuclear weapons attempted to inject greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
In the third-smallest animal , with 220 centimetres in length , the lineman , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
All the major Greenland sharks , by contrast , had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens core , which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
In fact , the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimetre Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years , while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old at 502 centimetres .
That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres , it was known .
Now , researchers of the length could be assigned an age .
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was determined at 156 years , Greenland sharks are obviously at least one and a half centuries old .
This , too , is likely to be a world record for vertebrates .
The fact that such methane is mainly found in icy waters is no coincidence .
Even the previous record holder , a 211-year-old Greenland whale in whose bacon on the neck put a 120-year-old harpoon top , was caught off Alaska .
Due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus .
So they mature later - and age more slowly .
In order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram elephant .
Another advantage : They have fewer enemies .
`` So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible , '' explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein .
A very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources more in a long life .

Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after 'Arab ' call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media call after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli preselection as it had `` requested '' Arab guests , according to an employee .
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentary `` Shoah '' left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ .
During his last stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel 's pre-election list .
However , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
Wrote Lanzmann .
Instead , the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own call center .
According to a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The response he received there `` shocked him , '' as Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel worker said that the measure was a `` deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotels . ''
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director .
`` Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted , '' Lanzmann 's employee was quoted as saying .
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a `` great shame , '' the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports .
We were appalled and dismayed by this event .
This is really very shameful .
The fact that this has happened in Germany in precisely this hotel chain is an even greater shame .
This needs no explanation .
We expect the hotel to `` draw the right conclusions , '' the appointee said .
The incident sparked a pretty big response on the internet , where people called the whole thing a scandal .
Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it would have `` caved in '' to the alleged calls of Arab guests .
`` Ashamed of you , '' it said in another post , noting that the hotel , located at the noble Kurfürstendamm , is near a synagogue .
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations of himself and called the incident an `` oversight '' and `` apologized '' at Lanzmann , Der Spiegel reports .
`` There has never been a direct instruction '' not to include Israel in the quick-vote list , `` the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying .
It adds that the country preselection has now been added .

Despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time race , cyclist Tony Martin does n't want to be let down .
`` I continue to keep the World Cup in view , stay confident and continue to fight , '' the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro .
He does n't have an explanation for his miserable 12th spot on the sugar rush .
`` I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday 's time drive , '' Martin remarked .
He had to calmly analyse the reasons for the debacle .
At the October World Cup in Qatar , Martin actually wanted to fight for the title .
'i 'm going to look at everything we 've changed in recent times . '
`` This includes my position , '' wrote the three-time time-driving champion , who had lost on Wednesday on the 54.5 km more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara ( Switzerland ) .

The US wins fourth match in women 's field hockey , a showdown with Britain imminent
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women 's American field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the American won 3-0 .
Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but Bam ( 27 ) said she could n't remember having ever done that .
`` I have no idea , '' she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
However , she knows that : American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place , who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 win against Japan .
Britain and the United States will clash on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals , the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will each gain first and second place .
The first-place finish will leave the strong Dutchman a little longer out of the way leading the other group .
Whatever Saturday 's game may run out , the American people have caused a surprising buzz through their success story , four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats at the past London Games .
BAM was part of that team .
She grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a hockey bat in his hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University ) , at 16 , she became a national player of the United States , the youngest in the team 's history .
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the cadets .
Then came 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
The following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , became coach of the national team and so things started to turn to the better .
`` A culture change , a mental change and a physical change , '' Bam said .
We did n't have the workload in London that we have now .
We 've been able to grab the helm completely .
On Thursday night , Bam opened the goalless in the first half of the game with a backhand shot from close range .
India went into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 down into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands .
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved into the middle and lured the ball into the gate to give the American women a 2-0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the United States , Jackie Briggs , who has so far had one goal in each of the previous games .
She has a run .
Just like Bam .
`` We 're in a good position '' said Parnham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .

Here comes the Enforcement trailer
Germany 's turf will have to adjust to the next generation speed gauge : In various federal states , including in Hesse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are supposed to transfer tempos particularly effectively .
The futuristic Enforcement trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
For example , at motorway construction sites or to rehabilitate bridges with a temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed .
However , a permanent mobile build-up can be too dangerous or time-consuming .
The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient : Its battery lasts five days during uninterrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
With laser measuring technology , all vehicles can be captured simultaneously across multiple tracks .
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
In the high-risk state , you can move the trailer , according to the manufacturer , with each car with a hitch .
So that it is not simply cloned , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and , by the way , even shadowy outer shell .
In addition , a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the Lightning from vandalism .
Since 2015 , the trailer has been tested in different federal states , according to Vitronic , and has now been used .
Foreign authorities are also blushing with the new technology : Recently , France has reordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .

Berlin / Schwerin : Poll ahead of country elections : SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) there are significant losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU .
This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the Bild newspaper ( Friday ) .
While the red-black coalition government in the north could narrowly continue to rule , this is not possible after the polls in Berlin .
In both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to be the leader .
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
The party would be just ahead of the CDU , according to the poll , which could come back to 23 percent .
Third place is controversial between the left and the AfD .
The left would be on 19 per cent ( previously 18.4 per cent ) , while the AfD would be represented at 19 per cent for the first time in the county .
The Greens are hesitating , despite slight losses , with 6 per cent ( previously 8.7 per cent ) back in the weigh-in country day .
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country with 3 percent each .
In the Berlin Chamber of Deputies , according to the poll , the poll would be only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.3 percent ) .
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent .
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.6 per cent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 per cent ( previously 11.7 per cent ) .
The AfD would be represented at 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies .
With 5 per cent , the FDP could be hoping for a return , but the pirates would miss entry in contrast to 2011 .

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
She is also a social worker on the ground .
Since July , Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach .
The social educator supports the management team of Achim Grockenberger .
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors : Refugees , Labour 's refugee agency , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Regine 's customer from the work group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there , the icy wool milk sau , which mainly has a problem .
So some - less spotty than rather aimed at the multitude of desired areas of responsibility - meant when the administration wanted to tender the place .
An administrative expert has been sought with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work .
But administrative work is not their central area , says Annika Deuschle .
Above all , it is about organisation , working with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks .
It has limited a 50 per cent point to three years .
`` It was prime time , '' says Regine 's customer , that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors .
There are large and small problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
Soon , new containers are in the water road
It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognised .
Local authorities are responsible for the follow-up .
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces .
The cost of building , renting or renovating these shelters must be borne by local authorities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the estate agent to the municipality and job center .
Problem : There are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
The search has been very difficult for some time .
De facto , the administration does not find private housing .
So far , it is not working , relying on private housing , according to Deuschle .
Therefore , public housing must be taken care of , as it is so nicely called .
So new containers will soon be erected in the Wasenstraße .
But only with apartments it is not done .
Perspective is the cue , Regine 's customer and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a permanent lead , there are internships , training places , school places , one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or set up .
`` More places would be good , '' Regine 's customer reports .
Many work in the building yard or help house masters , do charitable work - and that 's motivated and very tidy , as Annika Deuschle reports .
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact .
This is `` no employment therapy . ''
Activity , however , does not just mean work .
The day needs a fixed structure , say Deuschle and customer .
People need to develop a sense of belonging .
So there need to be offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
Professional courses are rare .
So here , too , administration and volunteers are jumping in .
It 's central that the refugees feel they are wanted and welcome in Germany .
The long duration of the procedures is a problem .
You have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time in a meaningful way , for example with language courses .
If you eventually develop the feeling , he ca n't help anyone in Urbach , should not work and be unnerving , who will never integrate .
The clear majority is motivated .
The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others .
All of this is already a `` mammoth task . ''
A difficult question : Do the two have fear of radicalisation after recent events , even in a small community like Urbach ?
`` No , '' says Regine 's customer quite clearly , `` which some may call naive , '' but a residual risk can not and would not rule them out .
However , the aid workers are already aware of this .
These incidents are also an issue among refugees .
Those would have the fear that the bombers will bring them completely into disrepute .
`` They want to show that they have nothing to do with it , '' says Regine 's customer .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
So primary and volunteers must look for activities on the ground and in the region .
In doing so , they always have in the background that soon a new blast of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach .
Does Germany need a ceiling ?
To answer this question clearly is to shy away from politics .
Actually , it 's unfair to put them helpers on the ground .
`` In Urbach , we have not yet arrived where we want to go , '' says Annika Deuschle .
No new refugees , that would ease the situation .
Regine 's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy integrating the existing people in a reasonable way .
These are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
But when people are in need , you need to help them , both women agree .
The political world is so complicated , there are no easy answers .

Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in star pile of plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades .
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in starlings rotate at different rates , as well as in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary formation .
`` We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , '' said Luisa Rebull , a researcher at Caltech 's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The star pile of the Plejades is 445 light-years away from Earth .
Many stars in this star cluster , which emerged about 125 million years ago , now reach adulthood .
They are turning fastest now .
At peak rotational rates , these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds .
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slowing effect on the stars .
When a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a discernible stellar fleece -- like sunspots -- .
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones .
`` In the '' Ballet `` of the Plejades , we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars , '' Rebull said .
As the star pile of the plejades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
`` The starlings of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , '' Rebull said .
There is still much in front of us that we would like to learn more about , such as how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and , so to speak , hang their `` dance shoes . ''
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades , which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal .

London schoolgirl who joined Islamic State was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS , reportedly died in Syria .
The lawyer , Tasnime Akunjee , said that her family learned of her death in Raqqa , Syria a few weeks ago .
It was believed she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa , the bulwark of the group in the country , ITV News reported on Thursday .
Sultana was 17 years old and died , according to her family , shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England .
`` One can only hope that the only good thing in it is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - stopping people from ever making that decision , '' Akunjee said .
In February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London stepped into a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultanah 's family have been told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .

Rain rather than stargazing : Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-studded gucker in south-west Germany a dash of the bill in the night of Friday - but there is still hope .
The night was ill-suited because of clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , the chairman of the observatory Welzheim , Hans-Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
Our hope is on the night of Saturday .
The weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see a lot of stargazing in the sky .
The star scales are Perseids , which , at 216,000 kilometres per hour , are among the fastest stargazers .
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus , which goes up in the north-east .

Laws are constantly being slashed in the name of counter-terrorism .
After the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Maizière is now laying out a hefty security package .
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror ?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator .
All his proposals are `` politically reasonable '' to the coalition partner , the federal interior minister says at the presentation of his new security package .
They do n't overcharge anyone .
Other , more far-reaching points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
As Home Secretary , however , he was keen on results and on a `` recoverable consensus '' within the coalition .
De Maizière took a little time to pass after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
But they are all the more extensive .
Some things are already known , announced , pitted : That a new security agency should take care of the crackling of encrypted communications is not new .
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law .
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security agencies comes as no surprise .
In part , de Maizière is launching a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : He wants to criminalise sympathy advertising for terrorist groups , and jihadists with dual citizenship take the German passport .
`` These will be difficult points for the SPD , '' the CDU man conceded .
Nevertheless , he believes that this is reasonable and does not call for anything that has no chance at all with the coalition partner .
A few new ideas presents de Maizière , too .
They have it in part : He plans fast-track procedures for deportations and more opportunities to incarcerate people from deportation .
Refugees who are targeted in the country are expected to check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review .
In acquiescing for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity .
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive .
Some of the work is still unspent and leaves questions unanswered .
And on some points - in the unequal treatment of the patient , for example - the question arises : What does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
Yes , says de Maizière , it 's important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
But there is no denying that the bombers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees .
In addition , many people were worried about safety , given the high numbers of refugees .
And things that people deeply engaged in could not be left out in campaign times as well .
Internal security has been hugely focused .
First the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
The uncertainty is great .
And yes , there are election campaigns .
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
In recent days , it has been high between the two parties .
First a garish battle over the equipping of the federal police , then via a security ideas collection of some Union interior ministers , in which departmental chiefs are also calling for a burqa ban and a move away from dual citizenship .
De Maizière is also struggling here for conciliatory sounds .
He does n't think anything of a move away from the double pass .
We have pacified the discussion in Germany .
Remaking it does n't make sense .
And in the event of a burqa ban , he has constitutional concerns .
Whether his own package is constitutional on all corners , and whether it is actually `` reasonable '' for the coalition partner , has yet to show up .
There is a lot in it that could cause controversy .
But the SPD is also currently trying to stand up on the issue of internal security .
Leader Sigmar Gabriel first signals cautious willingness to talk and says : `` The SPD is willing to talk about anything that helps to further increase security . ''

Simone Biles creates gold in women 's turkey
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all that .
Dynamic on the jump horse .
Effortless on the beam .
Stunning on the floor .
Absolutely brilliant .
And now , finally , Olympic champion .
The 19-year-old American turkey yelled to the multi-match title on Thursday and widened the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympics .
Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medallist and `` Final Five '' team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina .
The American-born Simone Biles Turns on the balance beam during the women 's single multi-game race in the art turkey at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-game title and overall the fifth , while consolidating her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
She broke down in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps , who has brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated her sport the last three years , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Rescue told her that she is `` the best turner I 've ever seen . ''
It expected it to be a final test in Brazil , a contest that did n't go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of outsized expectations .
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment .
The American-born Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace after they each won gold and silver in the women 's single multi-game series in the art turkey at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal Tuesday while serving on the farewell party of retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi as an exclamation point .
Although Biles insisted , during her long walk on the lead , never planned the future , that 's not really true .
Part of their ground exercises - which include her typical Tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
This is no coincidence .
This girl , who was adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman 's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained , became a force .
She has not lost a multi-match contest since the summer of 2013 , a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes .
Even though Mustafina easily led by two turns , the picture was trending .
Floating beams and ground turkeys - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurched .
She picked up again with 15.433 on the balance beam - and still put one on it with a 15.933 on the floor .
Raisman gently hugged her as she awaited her Endergbnis - a mere formality - and tears poured on Biles 's brilliantly red , white and blue Eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
Raisman 's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she struggled for third place , but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina .
This time , the 22-year-old team captain , dubbed `` grandma '' by the Americans , had a head start .
After her ground exercise , she accused the audience of Kusshunds , overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful .
As for Biles , the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-old from earlier this week has a whole new meaning :

Airline not liable : Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
The High Court of Düsseldorf ( Az . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only possible in the case of dangers typical of air transport .
The plaintiff had broken a knee ligament in the fall .
However , the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of death , according to the court .
The airline did not have to pay damages to the man .

Crazy for Kates cyclist 's doughnut and other famous doughnuts from Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come out this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot out of bounds and band , which has proved to be an impressive double in the Duchess of Cambridge .
But the 24-year-old Olympian this summer is far from the only one to have gold fighting athlete who has his own famous doughnuts - at least not if you 're allowed to believe social media .
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces currently flung on our screens , FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities .
The Hunter and the Wolf : Team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison , left , has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kates 's double-hitter on the bike race , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio .
The team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star look incredibly similar .
In fact , the Archers got the madness on social media and admitted that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
`` I myself do n't see much resemblance , with the exception of facial hair , '' Brady told the Huffington Post .
'he 's a good-looking guy , so I probably take that as a compliment . '
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt be even more central this year : The rising resemblance between British wicketkeeper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
Russian turner Aliya Mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , is said to be able to go through as a double-runner for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan .
And in the swimming pool , South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years .
A gear higher : This user believes that Nathan is the 'athletic version ' of the Inception actor
Another lingering comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett , who has similarly severe eyebrows and lips .
Russian silver medallist Yulia Efimova points out more than just the sun-soaked skin and blond hair as the actress Annalynne McCord , while American Nathan Adrian was attuned by fans , an `` athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt . ''
Strong women : Soccer star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one : One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put in the room : According to this user , there may be a reason for the couple 's likeness
One Twitter user explained her satisfaction that `` the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical . ''
In fact , US soccer star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes .
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile , which is nearly identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medallist in the turkey Gabby Douglas , which features her own gorgeous , wide smile that resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

Clintons earn $ 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax returns for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in an income of $ US10.75 million for the Democrats ' presidential candidate and her husband , and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 % .
In 2015 , the Clintons donated $ 1 million to charities , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $ US5.3 million in speaking fees ; the former secretary of state gave an income of $ US3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department .
Clinton 's candidate for the vice presidency , Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia , is publishing his tax returns of the last 10 years , along with his wife , Anne Holton .
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
`` Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , '' Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri admitted in a statement .
In a stark contrast , Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backers in relation to his previous promises to release his tax returns .
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not required by law to do so .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as the reason for his denial .
`` They 're on the train , '' Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter , in reference to the release of the Democrats ' presidential candidate .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump 's special adviser , told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are not completed .
Trump 's critics , including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , have already vowed that his refusal raises questions about wealth , his donations to charities , his business conduct , and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already toppled on the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax returns .
On Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
`` He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns , '' she said to the crowd .
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s for two years , and a business journalist at the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday , saying that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign .
Clinton supports a settlement named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett , who would ensure that people who earn more than $ US1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska called for Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has his seat here , to exchange Trump to a meeting to discuss their tax returns .
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the IRS and that Trump was `` afraid '' of voters rather than the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax returns dating back to 2007 .
The Clintons , who now live in Chappaqua , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
The Clinton 's tax returns of 2015 showed that these were only $ US100 of their income as a wage , unlike most of all Americans .
Their main asset was a low-cost index fund , from which the Clintons taxed dividends and earnings of $ US109,000 .

Olympics : Triple fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya 's athletics faces mischief after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
The International Olympic Committee was told to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
A Kenyan official had been told that the former sprinter and current coach , John Anzrah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich .
This was reported to Kenya 's team management by the doping inspectors .
The world governing body IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case to initiate its own investigations , an IAAF spokesman said .
`` Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC , the IAAF will make an assessment , '' they said in an IAAF statement .
`` He ( Anzrah ) went to the doping control station and turned out to be Ferguson Rotich , cast and signed the sample , '' explained Kenya 's chef de mission Stephan Arap Soi .
He was in possession of the athlete 's accreditation , which was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency .
Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth over 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing .
Four days earlier , Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
He is said to have informed against money-paying athletes from his country about pending doping tests .
According to media reports , he is said to have been arrested on his return at Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping offences .
In announcing the more than 2,000 doping target checks set up by the IOC before the Rio Games , it has been unusually pointed out beforehand that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system .
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began .
As a result , WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with WADA rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
The country 's athletics won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
In a series of television reports by ARD , there have been repeated accusations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he employed them in Russian athletics .
It has been shown that this sport has been widely and systematically doped in this sport .
Russia 's athletics were subsequently excluded from the Summer Games .

Buyers in Primark outraged by woman who tries shamelessly underwear in the middle of the shop
Buyers did n't know where they should look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the midst of a Primark to try undergarments .
To make the situation worse , she mustled as she looked into it , pulled her out and put it back on the shelf .
She continued to stab and tried four pairs of undergarments in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone .
The Primark shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where the woman tried the undergarments before putting it back on the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , `` she moved back in and left the business without buying anything . ''
She said : `` People could n't believe what they saw . ''
Standing in the middle of the sales floor , she took a pair of undergarments from the outlay , pulled out her own tights and trousers and tried them .
'She did n't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , freaking like Oskar . '
'Everyone stared when she pulled out the undergarments that obviously did n't like her as she put her back on the shelf . '
She repeated the same with three more undergarments before she finally decided that she did n't like anything , pulled up again and went out .
'She did n't seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who , in some circumstances , would buy the undergarments she had tried . '
Ms Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : `` How disgusting to think that someone would take undergarments with home who had a different person and who were not washed . ''
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added : `` As I got involved , the staff tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she went - which is just as good . ''
'i 'd hate to go home with a new pair of undergarments and find out that another woman had her and pulled it out again and they were n't washed . '
A spokesman for Primark said : `` Primark is aware of the incident , which occurred on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folkstone . ''
All the products in question have been pulled from the sale .

How to protect yourself with Krav Maga from gun attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you .
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi , a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed robbers at near distance .
Regardless of whether you 're approaching you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the mirror around for your robber .
If you look at you from behind , you should first turn around so you can see your attacker and `` get out of the firing line , '' Mizrachi says .
Then seize the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow .
Then beat him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the assailant curls up in pain , put the gun out of his hands , beat him with the run in the face and move backwards while they put the gun on him .
With attackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , seize the gun and twist it , so the attacker ca n't shoot .
At the same time , shift the weight to the gun and beat the attacker on the chest , then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and turning the gun on him .
Sounds difficult ?
Watch the video to see exactly how it predates Mizrachi .
But remember that in the case of a robbery , it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster .

Destination records : Who is actually buying records ?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates .
Before you rush to the comment section to oversow him under the pseudonym non-AlleEinsamenmen 's middle age with harsh insults , this statement derives from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-talked-about revival of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to embrace the news of physical items , but on midlife nostalgia .
Those who recently bought a record are likely to be aged between 45 and 54 .
In fact , the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group .
It 's also no hordes by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : Older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time on their own ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But are the results of YouGov ?
If this blog were a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I was running in the middle of a busy street in Soho , wearing a modest grey suit and sitting wildly , holding my hands and saying something like : `` So , let 's take a closer look at it . ''
So , let 's take a look at it .
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores .
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and spirits through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Sister Ray ( data count : Two young women , three middle-aged men ) to Reckless Records ( data count : Eight men of middle age , one woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is a day out because of a meeting in London and going through the shops to fill the few hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
`` I guess so , '' he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
These records , shown above ( he sent me the snap by email , I did n't follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : He is now able to buy plates he could n't afford when they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and bankrupt .
`` A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 ... things where I was probably a little too young to buy them to me , '' he says .
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and happy to spend time on their own , adding : `` I do n't smoke and I do n't drink very much .
That 's my loner .
WEZ , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media dog , people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records again .
From the conversations I have had , people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again , `` he says .
That would explain the boom to supporters of the record revivals of a certain age .
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people .
According to Wez , some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system .
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record hulls , from items that wake up happy youth memories .
`` I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation , '' says Wez .
This is the case with me as a collector and I think that 's the case with a lot of people .
It 's an easy way to engage mentally .
`` We 're like their social workers ! '' Infuriated an employee from a record stack .
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
The survey also found that 41 % own a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do n't own a record player .
At this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while blowing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data count : Three middle-aged men ) , has noticed a `` trophy aspect '' of the revival .
`` Someone only recently came in here and said , '' I do n't own a record player , but I 'd love to buy a Radiohead sound plate so I can put them on the shelf , `` he says .
This is not a large percentage , but it definitely happens .
More product-based , less music-related .
We have people who say , `` I do n't have a record player . ''
These are younger people , not older ones , who are only slowly getting in .
Fopp , which has dedicated the records to almost an entire floor , has a bungled audience when I go in .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists who take photos , teenagers and middle-aged women .
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above deals - Wild Beasts 's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drunks from the speakers - it 's good to see such diversity among customers .
None of them look very lonely , but niggling psychological traumas are hard to determine if you 're standing next to someone 30 seconds long .
Elanora , 27 , has been running around in the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of records for sale .
She is more likely to do a shop shop than a big buy .
It does n't deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It 's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... `` she drives off with a loving sigh .
I do n't know how to explain it - it 's really unique .
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : Urban Outfitters .
While I give the appearance of wearing jeans hotpants , I watch a group of young teenage girls grouped around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player .
To the left is a stairwell , a wall full of plates by Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : A mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far up , that it is impossible to touch them .
It 's pure `` record art . ''
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
It 's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates .
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are true , they do not take into account , at least in record stores in Soho , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and in online forums .
These people probably work hard at school or in offices .
They certainly do n't spend their Thursday morning strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates , while avoiding the startling look of an uncanny , 30-year-old fake presenter who towers over the shoulders of nothing suspecting middle-aged men .

Haigerloch : Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The miniseries from the watchdog Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were en route on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg .
Together , four stages have been completed .
In order to bridge the time until the next Roma pilgrimage of all miniseries in probably two years , the Oberministrantenround St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage .
Various places of pilgrimage were examined and it was finally decided for the bishop city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy with the gate of mercy at the Freiburger Münster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Minis from Bittelbronn , Gruol , Haigerloch and Heiligenrooms made their way .
On the evening before , pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimages and gave the pilgrimages .
From Horb , it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen , where there is also a Muster of Our Lady , and so the pilgrim from Münster took place .
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
But also along the way , the Minis on field crosses , chapels or churches repeatedly made roast to sing together a song from specially assembled pilgrim song booklet .
For the nights , parishes of the local parishes were available .
At the stage targets , Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast .
Further on , the second day went through furlongs to Gütenbach .
On the way to St. Peter , which was the most demanding route , they had to get off at an altitude of about 500 meters at the end of the season .
In the evening , the deserved reward was a common grilling at the Badweiher .
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , the final stage went to Freiburg .
Visibly relieved and happy , the Minis met at the Freiburger Münster later in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
With a little impulse , God was thanked here .
In the evening fair in Münster , the Minis arriving at the pilgrim 's destination were welcomed by co-operative Markus Obert .
After the service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar .
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis .
In the afternoon , it went back to Horb by train .
In the end , all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience .

The fees per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of €2.10 ; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp €3.36 ( previously $ 2.26 ) and for Azendorf €3.64 ( previously $ 2.18 ) .
At the plant in Azendorf , the sewerage fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
After an overblown calculation , the sewage price in Azendorf will then be $ 4.37 per cubic meter .
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser ( CSU ) reported , when the budget was approved by the estate agent Kulmbach , it was established that undercover was running out for these sewage plants .
On the basis of a legal basis , the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-effective manner .
From 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse .
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 per cent .
As managing director Herbert Schmidt showed up to the panel , a re-calculation of charges for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary .
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , it will also be possible to compensate for over- or undercover from the previous calculation period .
The serious fee increases were justified by the fact that all three sewage systems were relatively small , with a very low level of waste water , which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
For example , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
In addition , the volume of waste water in all three plants is declining slightly .
Furthermore , in the past calculation period , all three installations , not least because of their age , have incurred a considerable amount of recovery and repair costs .
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Welschenkahl , Neudorf and Reuth , as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage plant , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
In the pumping plant Welschenkahl , the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overtaken from scratch and , after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond , which disposed of sewage sludge and an additional ventilation facility , had to be installed in order to continue to comply with the water regulations .
Schmidt : `` To these extraordinary expenses came the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . ''
The same applies to electricity costs , which were still well below current levels in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low sewerage in the three plants , expenses for the operation and maintenance were `` fully pierced . ''
In doing so , Schmidt added , the market community has been spared major entertainment costs at sewage facilities over the past 20 years .
In the view of stone houses , the situation for these plants will remain precarious in the long term , especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Sewerage Association could not be extended to include these facilities , because they are loss-making facilities .

B27 clean-up : Restaurants suffer from lockdown
At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated , there is nothing to meckle .
For those in charge of the construction works , which start at 5.30am in the morning and only end at around 8pm , there is widespread praise .
`` They made it all pretty zacky , '' Elvira Tetzlaff told the jet petrol station .
This is a super team .
There is no delay either .
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time , until the end of October everything should be ready .
There is also praise for the accommodation of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary accommodation .
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has also been restored , the traffic situation within the site has eased .
Citizens will now be able to travel from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides .
The prevarication through the place seems to go back .
`` There have been some significant complaints about this , '' says the deputy principal investigator , Florian King , responsible for the transport-related management of the clean-up .
The residents of Bachsatzstrasse , Steinlachstraße , Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise because many snaps were looking and more familiar to their Navi than the signage .
Which led to some lorries being franked in residential areas .
Due to the fact that the speed limits were not respected , the municipality reinforced the measuring vehicle from Mössingen .
`` There were significant transgressions , '' says King , who himself was knowledgeable about the location .
Two to three per minute have already been blown up .
The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in the pace-30 zone .
Since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become calmer .
For the businessmen on the B 27 , it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg , the road is now open again .
Business people do n't like to look at the cards .
But that B 27 clean-up at them has led to sales slump , leaving anyone you ask to look through .
However , some are more and some less affected .
Those who have less to do with the `` end customer , '' that is , for other companies , for whom the clean-up has little impact .
Even at the dealership of Maier , Thomas Sulz talks of a `` maximum slight decline , '' but also acknowledges that , of course , `` the running mate is missing . ''
The most battered are the eateries along the street .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the Steakhouse , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
This is already existential .
Not only him , but all the restaurants hit it `` hard . ''
It lacked customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil .
We have to be happy about every euro turnover .
The revenue loss puts it at `` well over 50 percent . ''
Road rehabilitation has `` thrown back '' its operations `` by two years . ''
Half of his staff have had to sack him .
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been sacked , politics would have reacted differently .
Instead , government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner about whether there could be a financial compensation , saying the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the location on the B 27 Now they also have to bear the disadvantages caused by the clean-up .
Göhner knows of other counties where something more generous has been handled .
In all the lawsuits , Göhner is sure his restaurant will continue .
After all , the family business has been located here since 1715 , it refers to its long history .
That other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
If you ca n't go in , it 's nice elsewhere as well .
That his regulars come back after the end of remedial work , Göhner has no doubts about that .
Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history .
Six months of building work , that is already brutal .

Britain picks up silver in 7-yard rugby after Fiji Masterclass picks up gold
Britain 's impressive performance at 7-under rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis in the final on Thursday night , when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling , side-stepping , follow-up , line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
The defeat was sweetened by the not-so-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain 's fourth that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
The Boks ' significant defeat , 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
But regardless , Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team at best in this form .
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably wo n't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow : Fijian 's head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind .
Eight years ago , they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens .
Here , they lost only one .
This setback will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started miraculously and allowed the attacks to hit GBs out of fun .
It felt for the captain , Tom Mitchell , and co , as if running into moving buses ... the World Series winners went 5-0 up when osea Kolinisau ran out in the corner .
With still four minutes of game time , Jerry Tuwai added yet another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball .
A howling Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fiji .
In the seventh minute , JASA Veremalua leaped a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of game time ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou prepped through more weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal .
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break .
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning .
So it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Fijian gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant interim play by Fiji .
Dan Norton started a try for GB , making a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 , but the game went on for a long time in favour of the South Seas , whose fans sang , flags waved and danced in the public gallery .
It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis .
Mata Viliame set up the i-bag with another try in the final seconds .
The pantomime sounded , the Fijis embraced and GB kickstarted damning beaten into the turf .
Earlier in the day , Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-finals at 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Britain 's conversion of the difference .
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half .
A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .

Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government 's reforms to the public education system .
Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse students , resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas .
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans .
According to proposals from the governor of the federal state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , slightly fewer than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money .
Some of the protest participants saw graffitits against interim President Michel Temer spraying on walls .
The recent protests occurred a few days after protesters took to the streets in crowds to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff , who had been removed from office by a Senate vote on her dismissal .

CBC commentator for the Olympics apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer `` died like a pig ''
Byron MacDonald 's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-form swimming squadron outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypal Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer `` went off like tenants '' and during the race like `` a pig died . ''
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was switched off when he cast his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-form swimming squadron .
Macdonald , who had been picked to the commentary team of the CBS on board to lend more `` color , '' could be heard saying : `` This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection , baby . ''
Too excited , went off like Mief , died like a pig .
Thank you for that .
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan , 14 , swam the second leg of the swimming squadron 1 : 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada 's Taylor Ruck , which allowed Canadians to close the gap with China .
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted , `` Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China '' died like a pig `` ? ? ? ?
The idiot has n't captioned that they were still on show . '
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-form swimming squadron for women : `` This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection , baby . ''
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard , with many asking him to speak
Twitter users did n't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote : `` WoW , # ByronMacDonald .
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists . # angeekelt .
A short time later , Scott Russel , who moderated the CBC broadcast , apologised live for MacDonald 's comment and said : `` We apologise that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . ''
It was an unfortunate chosen phrase , we 're sorry it happened . '
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times among the people who responded to the notices on Twitter
The commentator 's colleague Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC coped and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald 's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message .
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
We quickly apologised to our viewers on show and our followers on social media last night .
To make one thing clear , Byron 's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person .
However , they were inappropriate and an ill-chosen wording , and Byron is very sorry for what he has said .
On Thursday afternoon , MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention for it to be interpreted as a personal attack .
`` I 'd like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women 's swimming staffer in the CBC Olympian , he said .
'i was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person . '
Of course , no disregard was intended and I 'm very sorry . '

Military leaders falsify ISIS intelligence information , notes committee of Congress
Military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground , an investigative committee of Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
The preliminary report , created by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Services Committee , Secret Service commenters and the conscientious objector , reported huge dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how precincts changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against Islamic State .
The Central Command , short Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` Intelligence information typically gendered by senior CENTCOM commanders regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , '' a newspaper article quoted the report as saying .
`` What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , '' Ken Calvert , Republican member of the House of Representatives , noted .
The leadership flaws in CENTCOM extend to the top top of the organization .
The 10-page report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` During the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts , '' the report noted .
For example , a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin as early as April or May 2015 .
Mosul , Iraq 's second-largest city , remains under the control of Islamic State .
`` After months of investigation , so much is clear , '' Mike Pompeo , Republican congressman from Kansas , said in a statement .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq .
Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
The report , published on Thursday , will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
In addition , further investigation of the CENTCOM reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence is underway .
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday , which agreed with some of the Republican task force 's conclusions .
`` In 2014 and 2015 , CENTCOM created an overly restricted process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services , '' the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee , member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement .
That process , Mr. Schiff said , `` delayed the publication of intelligence reports , '' damaging the morale among analysts and `` gave overly little room for dissent . ''
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of an intervention by the White House at the CENTCOM analysts regarding a `` certain political opinion . ''
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast .
Last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon 's inspector general , which was recorded following complaints from CENTCOM analysts .
Lt. Cmdr . Patrick Evans , a press officer at the Pentagon , admitted in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on any reports from Congress , while the inspector general 's investigation is still underway .
But he also admitted that `` experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . ''
The investigation has repercussions beyond the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
However , last year 's accusations have raised questions about how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than a decade ago , when a CENTCOM analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , provided only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State .
Last year , the team around Mr. Hooker notes , according to government agencies , that contrary to the government 's statements , air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group , as these temporary refineries would have been in operation to sell oil on the black market .
However , that finding was not released , the Times reported in September .
Centcom 's then-commander , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with coach 's cancer to rowing win
There will be no emotinal gold than in these games and that 's what you want to say .
From the first rowing strike to the last , 220 hard Hieve that go down in history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa .
Even though it was only the inmate who sat at the helm , there were three votes in the boat ; the echo of the coach , Robin Williams , was all-present as they were rumoured to be the second Olympian in the second without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport to set such a scale .
Their dominance was absolutely , after all , her 39th undefeated effort , which is also unprecedented .
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not fully reflect the kind of triumph .
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers , contributing to the incremental advances that make up the difference and there was no one more bemused than the coach who , 30 months ago , did n't know if he would survive that day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
As he said , he was risky .
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did .
If you do n't , it spreads everywhere .
It would have been a pretty dire situation .
It changes a little of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio were lucky that he could begin treatment in early 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 foot , 30 foot , 50 foot at a time when they said that some steps would suffice .
That 's how it starts .
Rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
In the immediacy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve-wracking morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
Stanning , who was a principal in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said `` I was an emotional wreck this week ... that might be something extreme , but it means so much . ''
It just repeats how much it means to me , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked .
It 's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him ... he 's the best coach in the world .
I could n't have wanted a better person to exercise or a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years .
The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
Even in the last 500 metres , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to shut up , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were very caught at the moment .
Helen cried `` stay in the process , stay in the process . ''
It 's really important not to get involved .
We had a good start and at the same time we were n't looking to make some tolles .
We did n't want fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
The pair will take a break for a year before it will make decisions about his future .
Glover must appear at a wedding next week , her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall .
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did n't want to say that this was my last race .
That would have meant too much pressure .
In London , it took around six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
Here it took about four minutes .
That feels so much better , `` she said .

Scot Callum Skinner stormed home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men 's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had embraced , making the legend proud when he stormed home to take home a win from the favourites New Zealand .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals .
They repeated the trick after catching only a modest sixth in March at the rail world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the recruit Jamie Staff .
They did so in time as Hindes appeared .
Hoy 's retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots , which has now unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Zealanders won in the first round .
And the British trio won the duel with gold .
Hindes fell short after his round , but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it .
A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation , in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny , and especially Skinner , to keep pace .
Hoy looked on from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner , Kenny and Hindes when these rose to the podium .
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said : `` It 's a flattering comparison . ''
I 'm only here to do my best and make a name for myself .
We set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions .
It was just unbelievable .
There is no better way to win .
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys , Hindes admitted that he intentionally fell on the train after a poor start .
He later withdrew that statement and there was no appeal from England 's rivals .
In such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time .
Hindes said : `` It feels with all the GB flags in the gallery like London . ''
We 've come together as a team in the last three months .
We got away so badly at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
This is an event , a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velodrome .
With the form of Kennys , it is in the realm of the possible that he repeats Hoy 's win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently sacred date for British sport ; on the day , Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the same from Hoy .
Kenny takes next in the sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said : `` I 'm just enjoying this for the moment . ''
The team event is always best .
You can win it with his colleagues .
It feels somewhat lonely to win on its own .
Hindes said : `` If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the knight . ''
It was the only medal contest of the day , but there was more good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-game four-kilometre race .
They came in 3 : 51,942 on goal .
The world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 51,659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where Wiggins will certainly be the focus .
He had been arguing with envoy before qualifying yesterday when officials called on him to measure his body size .
In the corresponding women 's competition , which will continue and end tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4 : 13,260 .
The GB team is relying on its strong rail cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a chunk of medals .
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down .
It played drama in the background , according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexting and bullying allegations , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
However , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom , it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .

Who is building Braunschweig 's cheap apartments ?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be given much greater responsibility in the future .
How do you respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 affordable homes over the next few years ?
The SPD proposes a `` concept of living '' at the next Council meeting .
But controversy is programmed .
First and foremost , the question is : Who should actually build the affordable housing ?
There is no regulation so far .
Obama group chairman Christoph Bratman thinks : `` We agree with the Greens : If you want to build on urban land , in the future , 20 per cent of all apartments will have to be designated as social housing . ''
However , the affordable apartments can also be found in the stock .
However , the big talking point at City Hall is , according to Bratman : `` How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? ''
'We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such land , but as much as 20 per cent of homes as social housing . '
A new urban housing support scheme , which will cost millions and still needs to be funded , is designed to provide incentives .
The problem , according to Bratman : `` There is still no agreement between the groups at the moment . ''
The CDU wants to give investors as few rules as possible .
The left still wants tougher requirements for investors .
Despite this , according to Bratman , there is a tightening of the situation in the housing market .
If the concept of action is implemented , this will provide for additional tasks in the building administration .
More staff will be needed .
It 's unclear whether we will get the professionals .
But the programme is not yet complete : The approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
But how do you compare the loss of another about 1300 affordable housing , the promotion of which will be phased out over the next few years ?
There will be 500 homes by 2020 alone .
To prevent this from happening , according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm , now expiring ties should be bought from the city .
In addition , consideration would have to be given to bringing housing back into price fixing .
This is possible in the western city .
At one stroke , the problem could be solved .
Because in the western city , deadlines expire at the end of the year .
Some 1800 apartments could be brought back there in price fixing for affordable housing .
Only : That 's what the owners want , the housing associations do n't .
Because , once again , the number of social housing in the western city will be dramatically increased , away from the goal of so-called mixing .
A concentration of social weak in just a few neighbourhoods should no longer exist .
The Greens reckon there will still be movement in the discussion .
Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke says : `` For a broad majority , the CDU must be on board . ''
The has focused on more building sites for single-family homes .
But that does not mean that a compromise can not be found .

Jennifer Aniston : I 'll always be put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does n't always have to be perfect or successful .
That 's what the Hollywood star made unequivocally clear in an interview now .
'i 'll always put in drawers or get glued from the outside label , which usually has little to do with me and the reality . '
'i myself do n't have the desire to always be perfect and successful . '
'to be honest , these things are more snug to me . '
Jennifer Aniston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered `` Miss Perfect , '' as she explains in the current `` Cosmopolitan . ''
Preferably , the actress spends her time at home , pre-TV with loose Dutton and Mexican food , the magazine says .
To the whitewash , she raises the question of the child 's wish : `` We women do n't have to be married or have children to be perfect , '' according to the Hollywood star .
In her new film `` Mother 's Day - Love is not a breeze , '' Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
The film runs with us from August 25 .

Once pushed over the price from the market , cafe comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi-Fi , but served 15 years of good coffee .
Of course , prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue shopfront .
The business Soap Cherie , which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cupcakes .
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city .
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , `` I know New York is change , but I still ca n't believe that CBGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exempt and verb is now a soap business . ''
But if New York is change , it 's also reinvention .
A revitalised Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint , less than a mile north of its original location .
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
The coffee is still good .
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a longtime employee of the old cafe , who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
When he offered a customer to provide funds for a new outsider , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , maintained a lot of things .
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
He introduced new ingredients .
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and saucy onions .
There are natural rice bowls .
The café does n't serve beer , there are fresh juices for that .
After nine months , Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
`` A lot of old customers were also pushed out by prices from Williamsburg , '' he said .
Recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer .
Oliveira , 34 , used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
Even after she moved to Greenpoint , she would take the path .
After the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drink for a while , she said .
`` It became clear to me that it was on the coffee and on the culture in the verb that I liked , '' she said .
Now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a Blended Chai Tea that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003 .
He went there before work and invariably ordered the same .
`` I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything-bagel with butter , '' he said .
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
Nowadays , Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything-bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he had no grudge about the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
In fact , the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cafe 's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient .
`` I think we 're still going to go on their offer , '' Rodriguez said .
And the traditional , Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe .
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he pretends to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
The location also has other benefits .
A local juice local would like to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee .
There 's a chance the cafe is expanding to a neighbouring building .
For many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favourites .
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
When the new cafe opened , Whitt said that entering the site and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home .
`` I had to smell that , '' he said .

Heavy rains , flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana , Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday , with more rain expected throughout Saturday .
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisianas and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with widespread flooding after extreme rains , the National Weather Service reported .
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards told reporters that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid to the affected communities is already on the way .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the governor 's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , told reporters that requests for flood vehicles , boats and sandbags increased .
Steele said that alone the community of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sandbags .
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisianas through Saturday .
The weather service reported that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in that area .
A flood alert system was used in southern Alabamas on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
The metereologist Alek Krautman says that both rivers could flood many homes in suburban neighborhoods near Baton Rouge .
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger , as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas across the rivers .
The River Tickfaw , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday .
Rescue teams still added people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and his stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday .
Hansford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet from his home , rose sharply overnight .
He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him .
`` We woke up and the water poured in and poured in , '' Hansford said .
It reached my waist .
His wife told Hansford that she 'd never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hansford said that he and his family members all had disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hansford said that Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and had taken them to the next fire station in Gloster , where they were housed until Friday .
Krautman said that the exuberance had `` spread quickly '' as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions .
According to Krautman , an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain .
Krautman said that the ground was considerably full-blown by the rains since Wednesday .
Authorities said that heavy rainfall and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching failure in five school districts .
CBS affiliate WWL reported that an inmate in Tangipahoa gave birth to 200 flooded homes .
Residents were evacuated to two churches , which have now both been inundated .
The foreman of the community of Robby Miller said that authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who were washed up by the flooding .
Shelters have been set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees .
`` Once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , '' he said .
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa , nearly two dozens of roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags provided for residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops .
`` The last major flooding we had was in March , '' said Lacy Landrum of the City Council .
This appears to be a similar incident .
In Mississipp , emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
According to his data , a handful of homes are believed to have been reported as inundated on Thursday , but on Friday , none have been reported until now .
Keith Townson , manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has already lived in the area for 40 years .
`` I 've seen water in places where I 've never seen it before , '' Townson said , `` and it 's still coming . ''

The £2-per-day drug that can cut heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug after it was recommended by authorities to administer this more people for an extended period of time .
The clotting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
The NHS 's regulator NICE has recommended a four year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
The NHS 's regulator NICE has recommended a four year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke .
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fetal material in the arterial walls that form bellies .
When the filler breaks apart , it can cause a blood clotting that clogs the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
When the blood clots dissolves , it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of another .
Ticagrelor , which is manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique , reduces that risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely .
NICE 's draft pick , published today , recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said : `` Despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . ''
Fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
Experience shows that Ticagrelor , in combination with aspirin , is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .

Still , Volkswagen is coming through lightly .
Despite the diesel scandal , delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
But not in all markets it runs around .
During the recall , there is buzz around a term .
Volkswagen will start operating in the second half of the year at the time of deliveries .
In spite of its many brands and some well-run markets , Europe 's biggest automaker continues to be a plus , despite its many brands and some well-run markets .
But in July , the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and again impacted overall sales , according to the company listed in the Dax .
Globally , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449100 cars than the same month last year .
In Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the same month last year .
In the home market of Germany , deliveries plummeted by almost a sixth .
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July in particular to two sales days less in Europe .
In addition , there has been a buy-back in some core markets through `` changing economic conditions . ''
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the UK voted to leave the EU , a spokeswoman explained .
In the US , where the exhaust fumes first escalated , a low is also on the rise .
Big support for VW is the Chinese market .
Overall , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is in any case further benign due to the diesel scandal : After the first seven months , there is only an delivery minus 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles .
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to provide a sales boost from January to July .
1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen in that time , worldwide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had been rigged with a software exhaust test .
In Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops .
As part of the conversion , VW reiterated that the revamp of the cars did not have a negative impact .
After the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
The automaker is issuing a `` guarantee '' certificate to customers after the conversion , but does not speak of a `` guarantee '' as it was in corporate travel on Friday .
The reason is legal niceties .
The `` Focus '' reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for revamped diesel models .
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Department of Transportation last Monday .
It was confirmed by the Department for Transport that there was this meeting .
`` VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and KBA . ''
`` Deviations from this are not accepted , '' Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) declared , according to the ministry .
VW has accepted the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion and that all type-approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term `` guarantee '' as it was in corporate travel .
Under the broad term `` guarantee , '' Volkswagen sees the possibility that , for example , customers may come to a workshop six months after conversion , for example , with an engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
In the interests of the customer , it is also important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the abortion scandal , will lead to uncertainty as to possible guarantee schemes , as has been said .
That is why VW does not use the term `` guarantee . ''

Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid , leader of Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court .
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland 's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge on Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia .
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland `` with a degree of certainty . ''
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating .
He praised Garland and said Clinton 's team would not cause unrest with a new candidate .
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. appellate court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republicans who blocked Garland 's nomination are Lakers and heroines of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
He also noted that Donald Trump is unsuitable for president .

French court rejects bid over demolition of shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by authorities in Calais to break down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live .
At a court hearing this week , authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to bring down 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offering hairdressing services or selling tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and sanitation risk .
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
They also said that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional deals , but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were `` absolutely understandable . ''
The judge , Jean-François Molla , said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who `` live in extremely precarious conditions . ''
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places threatened by the low-rise was the Jungle Book Kids ' Café of the Camp , which is operated by the public and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors in the camp .
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids ' cafe .
In a letter to the Guardian , it said that the closure `` would be a disaster for these children , the youngest of whom are eight years old . ''
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer .

Assistant doctors strike : Calls for new labour force action
Deputy assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour force measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
The Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has called on its entire council to approve more labour force measures from early September .
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract .
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA .
It was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained `` persistently quiet '' to problems , which led to the contract being rejected .
She said : `` In light of this , the JDC board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns . ''
In response to the government 's silence , the JDC board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor force action , which begins in early September .
The disputes resulted in assistant doctors striking six times this year , the first total cancellations in the history of the NHS .
The head of BMA assistant doctors Dr Johann Malawana stepped down after the election to reject the agreed contract terms that had been recommended by the BMA .
He told BMA members during the meetings , which took place even before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
After the vote , the Health Secretary , Jeremy Hunt , said that the contract would be forcibly introduced for doctors in England .

Russia and Turkey : An `` alliance of outsiders '' ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions .
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can not deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
There was the handshake , yes .
But Putin 's smile seemed shaky and he was barely radiating heat , even for his restrained conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his `` dear friend '' Putin - according to a report full five times .
I could n't count it anymore .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis , but will even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if anything bad had never happened .
To me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
But a sustainable boldness demonstrated by Putin showed that the leader of Russia had forgotten nothing .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : The firing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was wrenching .
Putin told and accused Ankara of dropping Russia in the back .
The offence was even greater as it was committed by a would-be friend .
Rebuilding the vetoes will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , the state-controlled media conducted a fierce , unrestricted attack on Ankara .
At one time , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
Most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan 's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State .
He has vehemently denied this .
But in St.Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to win some sort of victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire are clear .
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost stripped of his office last month in a failed coup .
Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
The number has decreased by almost 90 % .
In Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume .
They count on a late-seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
This week , state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
As a report in Vedemosti put it : `` Tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had added political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it views its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response .
This is followed by persistent resentment over the snail 's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey 's relationship with the West .
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for elected state bodies after the attempted coup .
This is , of course , a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change .
The summit in this lacklustre palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray one , as one analyst once described to me , `` Alliance of outsiders '' : Two countries that are in breach of the West and feel ill-treated and are now allied .
Nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both presidents testified at the news conference that they had n't even leveled the issue .
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize it .
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found .
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other again .

After that , they are said to have attacked two guests and injured one slightly .
After that , they fled .
At the snack and adjacent building there was a damage of 10000 euros .
According to investigators , there is a dispute in the Ulmer rocker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish corridor .

Bulgaria scores inflation for first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
This is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , when a positive 0.2 % was recorded .
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CPI -0.8 % .
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 % , i.e . monthly inflation was 1.0 % .

Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced its termination in a joint statement .
Gibson , who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner , apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his termination .
On set , there were artistic differences and a disagreement .
I regret the incident , `` he said in a note .
Details of how the character Gibsons is written out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , are expected to be released at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios .
The 54-year-old , who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg , had been with him since the first season of the series in 2005 .
`` I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heartbreak down the last 12 years , '' Gibson said in a statement released on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will not be possible now .
I 'd just like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
The planned airing of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28 .

England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London , but across the country .
For me , this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows , just as it was back in 2012 in London , when we ran a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the Games .
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End .
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow .
For our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
Just as they were ahead of us at London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlarging Heathrows is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage .
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcome , but Heathrow answers every question put to him .
Like the Olympics , Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individual .
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £211 billion in weather-related growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB .
We have a great team at Heathrow , which has implemented a £11bn expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row to become the world 's best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the midst of the world 's two busiest catwalks .
Now they are poised to deliver a third catwalk , which is supported by £16 billion in private investment .
The 2012 London Games have been a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .
Lord Paul Dwarton is chairman of the Heathrow board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury

One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and all-consuming
In the small HR-V , Honda wants to pack everything : A little SUV , a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan .
Sounds quite overloaded , but the HR-V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
Although the only 1.60m high HR-V looks rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear , it does n't work closely at any point .
The materials of the interior are well-processed and look pleasant , only the cockpit top falls slightly .
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage space .
It 's not just a trunk of 453 l at high-placed and 1026 l at overturned backrests available , but there 's the `` Magic Seats . ''
This is less magical than it sounds : The backbench seats can be folded up like cinema chairs , offering storage space that is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceilings .
The boot is well loaded , but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in a wide speed range .
However , he is likely to do his job a little more quietly .
Pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
There is another engine : A 1.5-litre petrol with 96 kW / 130 hp .
A four-wheel drive is not offered .
Driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamism and comfort .
However , the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant `` Executive . ''
The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the track assistant .
The collision warner sometimes irritates because , at Rangers , he assesses many obstacles as `` approaching objects . ''
The remote light assistant works very reliably .
And the smart speed regulator responds to traffic character recognition and throttles speed when needed .
However , full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7-inch touchscreen , Navi , app integration and more .
Two USB and an HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach .
The roughly $ 29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel is fine .
Those who do n't want to invest so much will receive the petrol from £20000 , the diesel from £23,000 .
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard .
With the HR-V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .

Assistant doctors want to organise more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt 's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him .
In July , Hunt unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be in a `` no-man 's land '' and that any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients .
The first assistant doctors are to be given a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the chair of the BMA committee for assistant doctors told reporters last night in a statement : `` Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly . ''
At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out .
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with the government 's reluctance to participate , and sometimes on deafening silence .
This was the result of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open .
'Jeremy Hunt must act now , lift the imposition and address the concerns of assistant doctors . '
If he fails to do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further industrial action .
The latest strike in late April saw a reprieve of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nurses and specialist doctors were included to provide cover to doctors on the strike pot chain .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
The BMA wants a better weekly wage for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , director general of NHS staff , urged assistant doctors to end the strike .
Mr Mortimer said : `` Labour force measures do not achieve any of the little , but already charge over-burdened teams and service providers , and prepare patients , nurses and their families only to worry , distress and interruption . ''
Over the past two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistant doctors and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Department of Health and other ministries .
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other major issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from a professional timeout , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , Health Education England and the Department of Health were about complying with the agreements with the BMA in November , February and May .

Seriously injured - man stabbed on his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked and seriously injured his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife .
As police announced yesterday , the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
Instead , the alcohol-fuelled offender cut off his ex-girlfriend 's clothes .
When this came into the apartment , he stole twice on her .
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body .
Police were able to arrest the perpetrator .
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend 's clothes , he called his mother .
This then alerted his sister .
Together with her partner , the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother .
But she was unable to persuade him to leave the flat .
That 's why she walked out of the house with her partner .
On the street , they met the man 's ex-partner .
When the two women entered the apartment again , the 50-year-old snubbed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend .

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
Thus , in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and firms from London .
`` It 's very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote , '' says Michael Voigtlands , head of the IW 's competence field and property markets .
After the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether financial institutions will be allowed to continue to operate from London from financial operations across the EU .
For the so-called EU passport , they have so far been granted authorisation in the UK .
That 's just using big U.S. banks .
Several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs .
The lobby association `` Frankfurt Main Finance '' expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
For Frankfurt , according to the IW , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the eurozone 's largest banks , as well as other key authorities such as the European insurance watchdog EIOPA and the Risk Board of ESRB .
In Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial industry than the ECB .
`` The proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate so directly with supervision , '' says IW professor Voigtlands .
Luxembourg has a large fund industry , but , like Dublin , it is worse off when it comes to infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
In addition , the city has easily accessible commercial real estate .
`` In Paris , it 's not so easy to find free high-quality offices , '' Voigtlands says .
In addition , on the Seine , rents for first-class commercial real estate are 50 per cent higher than on the main .
In addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good health care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
In a ranking of consultancy Mercer , the city stands at number seven , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 37th place .
Even though quality of life is a matter of preferences : `` With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , '' the IW concludes .
London , however , will remain the main financial centre in Europe despite the Brexit vote , the economic researchers say .
There is also the balance of power : In London , according to figures from Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015 , some 144,000 people worked in the banking sector , and in Frankfurt there were 62500 .

More than just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue .
Kendall , who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday .
`` In a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to the wines , '' Kendall wrote .
The revelation of the cover-up was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar ? ) , scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the much-loved showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) as they have forgotten the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic twist : They have all planned a surprise party .
This represents the cliched plot of almost every birthday episode of a children 's show ( Seacrest brought the phrase , `` You thought that we would have forgotten you ? , '' with the honesty of a cartoon canine on a broadcast slot at 8 in the morning ) , but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity .
With regards to the September issue of Vogue , certainly a new era of the Kardashians has begun .
Kendall 's big sister , Kim , may have beaten her in terms of the Vogue cover ( she and her husband Kanye West were seen on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
The September issue is the most selling edition of the year for Vogue .
With a scope more akin to a picture band than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 's 615 pages advertising ) .
The unveiling of his cocoon is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years , images of the magazine were leaked even before the official announcement .
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In recent years , there have clearly been more `` celebrities who are mocking '' as `` models that are famous '' on the cover .
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady Gaga had the honour .
But even at the low chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the `` breakthrough model '' of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video ( even if it all applies to Jenner ) .
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the final cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade .
Of course , Jenner 's success does n't please everyone .
With her reality TV history , Jenner 's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat fraught .
In June , incoming Victoria 's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called them `` the mistpieces of the moment . ''
Those feelings boiled over again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover .
But riding on the resentment seems to be at the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue .
She is literally a supermodel .
She runs for Marc Jacobs .
She makes adverts for your primer of Estee Lauder .
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps .
She sells from her made images of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to the magazine LOVE .
And in her spare time she is seen on reality TV , presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children .

Steel - bright spot for German steel industry
The crisis-battered and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared an additional cost of millions of dollars .
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from oil production are off the table .
It remains with the exemption from the renewable-energy levy at the inventory facilities to so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry , Federal Industry Minister Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung ( WAZ , Friday edition ) .
`` I am really pleased that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . ''
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gases from the blast furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption .
The steel industry threatened additional costs of $ 120 to $ 240 million a year , according to the German Industry Association .
Gabriel told WAtoday there was now a landmark agreement with the European Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steel works that an EEG-surcharge of 20 per cent falls .
But this , too , is not raised in the steel industry .
The IG welcomed Germany 's agreement with the EU Commission on self-energy production .
This largely enshrines the status quo of the current regime .
Gabriel 's successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
'in terms of our campaign 'steel is future ' this is a first step . '
`` More must follow . ''
`` There are also climate and employment objectives to be weighed up in the reform of the emissions trading scheme , '' said IG 's chief executive Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
Last year , the situation worsened further as the world 's largest producer country , China , threw mass steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand .
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping .
Over the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat .
On the one hand , import tariffs imposed on imports have an impact , and the economic outlook in China has brightened .
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday .
Most recently , prices have tended to stagnate .
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
At the same time , ThyssenKrupp did not want to rule out the closure of individual works .
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
In July , German steelmakers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
They produced a good six per cent less crude steel at 3.4 million tonnes than in the same month last year , according to the Business Association of Steel on Friday .
After a brief increase in May , the produced crowd now went back the second month in a row .
Since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year .
The association expects rising emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .

The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers to pay punitive interest rates in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
Bank chief executive Josef Paul said on Thursday : `` It 's only about 139 customers who park $ 40 million on current or day money accounts . ''
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an isolated case and does not see it as a signal : Ordinary savers `` should not be afraid to pay for their asparagus penalty rates . ''
Store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 per cent penalty rate .
This fee requires Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over $ 100,000 on current or daily money accounts .
'the first £100,000 is free . '
`` The next 100,000 will cost $ 400 a year in the future , '' Paul said .
He has been wary of £40 million for some time , which could be relegated from one day to the other and which he could not exploit .
`` Those lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , '' the bank chief said .
'i ca n't put down for every £4,000 . '
In accordance with the 'polluter pays ' principle , the costs will now continue .
Leaving the cash simply in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous : `` I 've already experienced four overs , I do n't like the fifth ! '' The bank chairman said .
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment .
Few migrated to other banks .
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria stated : `` The ECB 's extreme monetary policy rate is causing significant costs for all banks . ''
Carrying it alone is `` economically not possible on a permanent basis . ''
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or credit transfers .
With punitive interest rates on deposits starting at $ 3 million , the Thurston People 's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kemmer , chief executive of the Banking Association , said : `` We do not expect retail customers to have to pay blanket fees for deposits , so competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong . ''
One banker said that at Tegernsee there is `` a clientele that is a little more exuberant by the wealth . ''
`` This can become a problem for a small bank '' if it hunted for free money .
The cooperative bank Gmund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach-Ewen , Kreuth and Tegernsee .
Well-known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria `` is not currently aware of any other banks that charge an outlet rate for deposits from retail customers , '' spokesman earnest said .
The President of the Federal Association of German People 's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken ( BVR ) , Uwe Fröhlich , said at the end of June : `` The threshold of going negative towards the private customer is very , very high . ''
The competition is tough , and it is threatening the exodus of investors to the competition .
Customers in Germany wo n't like that in width .

Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the refund of the legal costs incurred by her from the Hepatits C legal battle with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc .
In June , Gilead was freed from a $ 200 million compensation payment for the violation of two patents by Merck , which was related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of Mercks , including the Meineides and other unethical acts .
In collecting the lawsuit on Thursday , U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to enactment of the costs incurred while defending the case .
Merck is trying to equalise with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
The case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Merck sued each other and took ownership of laboratory work involving Sofosbuvir , the active ingredient in Gilead 's drugs .

Rescue in Moelfre Bay : Three men have `` good luck still to be alive ''
Three men are `` lucky to still be alive '' after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey .
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay .
The three men had difficulty swimming to safety while their boat moved on on their own .

`` Fortunately , the strong winds have already waved the boat out of their reach until we left to water , '' he added .
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat , while the third man , aged 60 , was exhausted and found at a Boje hanging without a rescue vest .
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said : `` The three men thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive .
The boat engine had an emergency stopper , but the boat was removed by the person who was driving the boat .
Someone was waking up about these men today .

Tourists in Portugal panicked after a tieffing military jet flies over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese-based P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force put down an incredible storm flight
The Air Force said that it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
This was the moment terrified tourists start to panic after a tipped jet crashed over a full beach .
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity over the sun 's ankles on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal .
Holidaymakers sped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming through the clouds on them .
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media , said : `` It flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash . ''
Nuno Arroja added : `` I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . ''
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
The spokesman said that due to poor visibility , the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility , however the Air Force insisted that security was at no time at risk .
Wildfires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , which also killed four people on the island of Madeira .
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

The depressing food of the economic crisis in `` a plentiful meal ''
In March 1933 , shortly after his rise to president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
As a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup .
His menu that day was slightly more modest : Stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato puree and as dessert a plum pudding .
`` It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , '' Jane Ziegelman said .
Her husband , Andrew Coe , added , `` It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat . ''
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coes 's last book `` Chop Suey '' acted from Chinese cuisine in the United States , while brick was told in her book `` 97 Orchard '' about life in a residence on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
Her latest collaboration , `` A decent meal , '' which will appear at Harper Publishing on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg 's Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , sniffing snack in the Flatiron District , which has already been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Brick man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Coe , 57 , ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered pecking , this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
`` Rich food was very popular , '' Ziegelman said .
There was groundnut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap , stretching the ingredient .
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner .
Coe grinned .
`` It must have laid in the stomach like lead , '' he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table was an All-You-Can-Eat buffet in an American household , especially in rural areas .
Crews of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastes for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War .
`` It was a time when food became a central , tense topic for Americans , '' Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
Just as tense was the new budget diet : Mysterious dishes such as brows and casseroles became staple foods , the casserole as a `` wonderful way to reuse food leftovers , '' brick man noted , as chefs were able to hide unsavoury ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
Meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rarely serrated luxury .
Strange blends have been tried , as calorie-rich and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even healthy cooking .
During her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with peanut butter , too .
`` It was n't a popular addition at lunchtime , '' Coe says .
Brickman continues : `` It was surreal . ''
Peanut butter and baked onions do n't match each other .
It was typical of many of the home business recipes .
Like never before or since , budget economists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - drove the country 's eating habits in such a way .
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become `` household politicians '' and to live up to the challenge of turning pep like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
`` A Square Meal '' is a celebration of historical delicacies .
Particularly palatable are the reports of the government 's response to starving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoover 's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude .
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he fed up like the billionaire man of world to whom he has become .
`` He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce , '' Coe said .
He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room and wore a smoker .
He was delightfully out of touch with reality .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife , Eleanor , had asked him to set an example with his stomach .
As described in the book , the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most defiant. ``
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , dealing with food , was discarded once the country got back on its feet .
The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Ziegelman said , as well as on how science was applied to food .
The pair admitted to the book 's writing to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman 's mother-in-law - for example , how she could n't throw away food .
`` She had a real fear of wasting food , '' Coe said .
Ziegelman recalled : `` She was actually making people sick . ''
There was the windbag incident .
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg 's , she and Coe drew a dessert they had prepared at home : The plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at noon .
`` It 's called Prune Whip , '' Ziegelman said , adding that it was a nasty trick to miss humble recipes a chic name .
There was no beaten cream , just plums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Everyone appeared somewhat reluctant to put a spoon in the taller , brown glibber .
Amazingly , it did n't look bad .
CoE picked up an aftershock three times .
Like a Can-Do budget maker , he said to his wife , `` A few chopped walnuts would help . ''

Old buildings , a few lime trees , some remaining cobblestones in between : The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like it at first glance , but the police rank them among the `` dangerous places '' of the city .
Walking down the road from east to west , you arrive at playgrounds , a fresh-coated nursery and a biolade .
On the facade of a grey house , someone sprayed `` ugly ! ''
Opposite a Lidl , which is also soon to be demolished , is already being built : By 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be created here .
However , articles about this `` trendy neighborhood , '' as the relevant real estate firm Friedrichshain calls it , are preferred with burning cars in recent weeks .
The reason is the house with the number 94 : Once it was occupied , the residents now have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
In particular , Berlin interior senator Henkel had argued several times since the beginning of the year for a crackdown by police against the project , describing the area as a `` no-go zone '' for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
After , on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kadtermiths , with 300 police officers had been cleared , police patrolled three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on the ground , closed parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
Meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners .
On July 13 , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents .
On this summer afternoon , the street looks peaceful : Parents walk with children , people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun , while others entertain prep spenders .
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens .
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in Kiev since 1999 , and Jana * , who is raising three children here , are mainly terrified by the police presence .
With the residents of the house projects , they share concerns about rising rents and gentrification .
It does not sound like a Kiev , the majority of whom wanted police protection from vandalizing left .
The ditch that the Berlin interior senator and police make up between housemates and their neighbours does not appear to exist .
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district , which even today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city .
In 1990 a large number of houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main Street in the vicinity of the Rigaer .
While the mainstays had been cleared under a large police lineup in an outright street battle , many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
At the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world in recent years .
This is also noticeable in rents , which have risen by nearly 60 per cent since 2009 in new rentals .
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development : They can be seen on discarded windows or freshly painted facades , which have been pelted with paint bags .
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words `` left-wing autonomous violence . ''
One reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : Crimes such as injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively against police officers .
Most of the crimes make property damage , which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated homes .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
As for acts of violence , it is appeasement : The people in the 94 are their neighbours , who certainly were not .
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer any longer .
For the studied architect , their street is not a criminal flashpoint , on the contrary : `` Here you help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . ''
Neugebauer is deliberately drawn to Rigaer Street - and stayed .
That 's why it was so important to her that residents get their street back : From the police , the politics and the media , who in July all suddenly claimed the interpretive power over the district .
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer , the road will continue to be taken away from them : Through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that outnumber the old residents .
`` These are , after all , condominiums that are not interesting to many here - here are more people who are not so well-behaved , '' she says .
`` I absolutely do not approve of violence and destruction . ''
But what should you do if someone never listens to anyone ?
There is frustration on all sides , including the police and residents .
For Zudrew , who is annoyed by color bombs , Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding : The house projects and the left-wing scene were part of the Kiez .
If you 're coming in , you should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there .
All people presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their real name

Community , spirit , health : Singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life : As a young girl she was in the school choir , in Lehramt studies she finished the subject of music , and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir .
`` Singing moves me - emotionally and physically , '' she describes .
After a sample , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more vibrant , she says .
By the way , she is doing something good for her health and her mind .
Because singing is equally from multiple perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League .
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music , describes Hackler .
Through regular gathering , seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts .
Because often social and family structures are solved in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir : `` To talk down and organize , to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness . ''
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense , Hackler suggests .
Because in doing so , seniors exercise deep and controlled breathing .
If you ask for your lungs regularly , you do n't get out of the puddle in everyday life as well .
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
On older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labor Association of senior organizations .
In the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence .
Through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia-stricken people remember long-running events .
When singing , the head is also required to perform a special performance , explains Lenz .
At the same time focusing on your own voice and on a given rhythm , adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
It 's just older people who live alone , so do n't just focus on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by singing in the choir , according to Hackler .
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the chorus .
To show yourself : If I do for a long time for something , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
Good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
If you want to try a new hobby , do n't hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , Lenz advises .
You are not alone in singing - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes next ?
Looking for the right offer , seniors have different options , says Hackler .
Singing someone from the acquaintance 's circle in a senior choir , you can just join in .
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area .
If you want to sing in a church choir , you can turn directly to the community or the church precinct .
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
If you do n't have access to the Internet , you can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet search .
Those keen to sing should definitely join a chorus , Hackler advises .
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that 's true of any age .

Rio 2016 : ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
Not always the Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics .
This is shown by the bold appearance of ROBEL Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
At the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that at times he was no longer seen in the TV images .
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected .
On social networks , Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit .
In fact , the 24-year-old finished his pre-race with a lag of 48 seconds and finished in the 59th place of 59 starts .
It was , however , more his not exactly sporting figure that drew the attention of the international media .
Why the 24-year-old still attends the Olympics ?
The Ethiopians got a special starting right from the international swimming federation .
This will be distributed to promote swimming in under-represented countries .
As most athletes run in Äthopia , Habte simply wanted to do something else .
Preparation is everything : ROBEL Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race .
Quickly , the first nicknames made the rounds .
Some media described him as a `` ROBEL of the whale . ''
In reference to a `` wealth bump , '' the English tabloid `` The Sun '' made fun of him with `` Dad Bod . ''
His time , he struck only with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 metres overhead , played no part in it .
Comparisons with `` Eric the Eel '' were also drawn .
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics , the run of Eric Moussambani caused media attention .
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to compete on his own in a run-up over 100 metres .
Fittingly , Moussambani was fired at the time .
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the contest .

Donald Trump election campaign charged after staff allegedly pulled gun
New York : Donald Trump 's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina turned a firearm on an employee in February while traveling in a Jeep in February .
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the National Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in that state .
Bordini admitted to waiting for months that the matter would be dealt with internally before he realised that `` this would not happen . ''
The campaign manager , Earl Philip , `` pulled a pistol , put his right index finger on the deduction , and rammed the run in Vincents knee throat , '' Bordini admitted in his indictment .
After complaining to the local and regional campaign board , Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip , he admitted in the indictment .
`` Guns do n't have to be fired to cause harm , '' Bordini admitted .
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the `` Second Amendment people '' - firearms owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges .
Trump 's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence .
Bordini 's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for assault occasioning bodily harm and bleaching psychological damage .
Trump 's press secretary , Hope Hicks , could not be reached for comment .
Attempts to contact Philip also failed .
WCCB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
There has been no response to calls to his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far .
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc. , 16-CS-14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

CSF leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK swaps its boss Matthias Hartmann .
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprising .
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK foresaw that the chair of Chief Executive Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the successes he has promised .
Turmoil at the top of the Nuremberg market research firm GfK : After again disappointing business rates and the resignation of corporate governance , the industry 's world number five is facing a human fresh start .
CSF 's CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board , Arno Mahlert , is already leaving the supervisory board with effect from 12 September .
The leadership on the board already takes over the previous board member , Gerhard Hausruckinger , as of 1 September , the company said .
He is expected to officially take over the function of a `` CEO '' until a successor to Hartmann is found .
As a result of the resignations , the company cited `` different views '' on long-term business policy direction .
Details declined to name a company spokesman on Friday .
Who will run the market research company in the future is still unclear at the moment .
In investor circles , it was said on Friday that there was a great deal of disappointment among shareholders about the continued success of the restructuring that began years ago .
Mr Hartman has been at the GfK top since 2011 .
`` The fruits of the restructuring , however , are still not visible after 5 years , '' it said .
Given the recent poor GfK business figures , each shareholder will eventually be unsettled .
`` If that were the case with BMW , that would also make the quandts that way , '' they said .
The company had also been unable to stop its losing drive in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter .
At $ 361.2 million , sales were up 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable year-on-year quarter .
Related to the first half of the year , sales shrank by 3.4 per cent at $ 721.2 million .
Profit in the second quarter mainly impacted the company 's lowered value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
The company value write-off of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Division , gave the Group a loss of EUR 148.2 million .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GfK still generated a net profit of 19.7 million .

Supercup : Barca with concerns about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday .
The Catalans compete in the dugout for the Spanish Supercup against FC Sevilla , the replay rising three days later at the Camp Nou .
The doublewinner has to give up in the crofting dinner with the outspoken Cupfinalist and ruling Europa League champion among others on Neymar , who is disputing the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
Also missing is Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen .
The German suffered a blizzard in the knee in training , making the one-on-one issue at Barca , at least for now , cleared in favour of Claudio Bravo .
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refrained from making a clear decision in this respect , leaving Bravo in the league , but Ter Stegen takes the lead in most of the remaining contests .
Before the first must-win of the new season , at the Spanish Masters , there are doubts about the fitness condition of the team , which was humiliated at 0-4 on Saturday in a Test match by Liverpool .
Even at 3-2 in the Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday , Lionel Messi and co still did n't really know how to convince .
Sevilla , in turn , have to digest the 2-3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the `` Supercopa de Espana . ''
Barcelona , with eleven successes so far , are the record winners in this competition .

Culture of Political Correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim neighborhoods
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored , as a damning government report revealed today .
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally attacking the police , election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to `` over-sensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion . ''
The former minister for integration and local government , who is now an anti-corruption king , said that intimidating voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up shutters outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters .
He recommends that voters should carry an ID to prove their identity in elections .
At the moment , a voter only has to name his name and address .
The report suggests not wearing removable ink on a person 's finger when they cast their election vote to prevent anyone from voting twice .
Whistleblowers should be given more protection , says Sir Eric .
He calls for the press to have more access to community records and decisions from non-official committees or working groups .
`` This serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it , '' he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London .
Last year , a special electoral court ruled that the current mayor , Lutfur Rahman , should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
The court found that Rahman `` would have perverted '' the religious feelings of his Muslim community `` in a cynical manner '' and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic abuse .
Rahman is said to have `` run his campaign on the basis that it is the reliever duty of Muslims to elect him . ''
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation where a person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent briefing - where older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including driving out ways to prove identity
His report said : `` As evidence has been given that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the elderly , particularly communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background .
`` There were concerns that ... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of '' politically correct `` oversensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion . ''
Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban on political activists editing briefing papers to stop `` election harvests . ''
The report , which is being considered by Theresa May , also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral register from being used on immigration and social fraud purposes .
Consider options to ask voters before the election according to your ID .
Do n't use removable ink on a person 's finger as soon as they cast their vote to prevent anyone from voting twice .
Carry out systematic reviews of a person 's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote .
Ban that political activists process full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections .
Give the police the power to set up shutdowns around polling stations .
A change in the law that facilitates a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 .
Ban on photography at polling stations .
Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
Intensifying training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth on their own .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it `` amazing '' that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case .
`` The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unfit due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , '' he said .
He was found guilty for a number of reasons , in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
He also criticizes the ineffective `` abortion controls '' of the town halls `` electoral registration departments .
Sir Eric said : `` The court ruling in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal .
Our country , as the mother of parliaments , has a proud heritage , but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this reputation .

NASA climate model : Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
Scientists at NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus 's past using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
The model was designed to determine whether Venus , with its hot , watery surface and carbon-dense atmosphere , might once have had Earth-like conditions .
Scientists have previously hinted that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin , earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus .
The planet probably pointed to more dry neighborhoods than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic variability to house lives and protected against rapid evaporation .
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 per cent matter .
`` In the Giss model simulation , the slow turn of Venus exposed its day side of the sun for nearly two months , '' Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release .
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun 's heat .
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today .
The model spawned a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously believed by planetary scientists .
Although it was once believed to be habitable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
Their oceans darkened and their water vapour was burned away by the ultraviolet light .
As her hydrogen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which as we know it today .
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters .

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and `` defending champion '' Zhang Jike 4-0 ( 12.5.4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided final .
As a result , the world number one picked up the `` Golden Grand Slam '' with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour finals tournament and just Olympics .
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani .
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected , and made the title among themselves .
As a result , it was clear that , for the third time in a row , a Chinese would score the singles title in the sign of the Five Rings .
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic treble was former SVS-NÖ-Legionnaire Ryu Seung-min of South Korea .
Ma and Zhang were left at the plate alone , between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches at themselves .
Those had withdrawn to the grandstand and left their trenches in fair competition on their own .
'the matches up to here I 've played for my country . '
`` In the final , I 'm playing for me , '' Zhang had said logically .
After the match , gold and silver medallists posed with the China flag .
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided .
Ma had really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set .
After that , he determined the pace at the plate and left Zhang from there only a total of 13 points .
By the superiority of Ma did not develop the expected stirring match .
But there were nevertheless plenty of breathtaking ball changes to see .
Mizutani won the game for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4 : 1 .
The Belarussian had grabbed a rib injury in his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov , was in medical treatment afterwards , had to `` ultimately '' settle with sheet metal .
By the way , the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jörgen Persson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similarly high table tennis .

Condoms with chilipuder , fireworks promote Tanzanian elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to inhabited settlements in people - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipudes .
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation , which already had the idea to do so years ago , has intensified its promotion , along with US conservation , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals .
Previously , many spears used to defend themselves .
Friday is world phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
`` Since we developed the ... toolkit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , being much more confident that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant in it , '' the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a note .
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
If he is not deterred , a so-called `` Chilicloud '' is thrown .
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom , the end of which is turned down to the ignition .
When it is lit , the condom bursts with a bang and spits fine dust to Chilipuder into the air .
A touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant .
One last possibility is a scorer who shoots a gold fire in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

Patrick Roy resigns as coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy stepped down as coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday and introduced too little co-determination in the team 's decision-making process .
Alternatively President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed that decision and noted that the club will look for a new coach immediately .
`` Over the last three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , '' the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement .
I 've been thinking for a long time and a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , need it and bring it to a higher level .
To achieve this , the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
He must also have a co-determination right in decisions that affect the team 's performance .
These conditions are not being met at the moment .
Sakic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked him for his contributions for the team .
`` Patrick informed me of this decision today , '' Sakic said .
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was named the best coach in the league during his debut season at the Avalanches in 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams awards .
He led the club to 112 points and on first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota 's playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the two final years .
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild-card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper , Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .

Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Multiple deaths
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , the Foreign Ministry spokesman , Thomas Schnöll , said Friday morning .
She suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital but has already been able to leave it again .
Their journey home was planned for early September .
It is still unclear whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket , as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon , are still unclear .
The State Department is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard , according to Schnöll .
In the roughly 200 miles south of the capital , Bangkok , Hua Hin first exploded two bombs on Thursday night in a nightlife area .
According to police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning , then again , two explosives went up , while another man was killed , according to the authorities .
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning .
A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the seaside resort popular with holidaymakers , according to police figures .
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country , another bomb exploded , killing an urban employee .
The explosive device went into the air in a flower frame in front of the repose of coastal police , according to the authorities .
Finally , detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast claimed several casualties .
You go from a link to the explosions in Hua Hin , they said .
`` The bomb blasts carry the same handwriting , '' army general Danai Kritmethavee told journalists Friday morning .
'We assume it is a coordinated attack . '
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bomb blasts of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
Thai police , on the other hand , said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or with international terrorism .
`` This is just local sabotage , which is limited to limited areas and provinces , '' a spokesman in Bangkok said .
On the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta .
Authorities have received intelligence evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however they have not been informed of the exact timing and locations .
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
Police instructed their officials across the country to step up security around key government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
There are always minor bomb attacks in Thailand , but they are usually not directed against tourists .
In Hua Hin lies a palace used for years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
Following today 's bomb explosions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
High security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla , as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings .
After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need to travel to these provinces .
Increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta .
This gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to incite chaos , while the country was moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
The military unta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , is self-sustaining , bringing the kingdom back to stability and order .
However , the military has also failed to get to grips with the insurgency of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years .
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
Just over a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists .
It was the bloodiest attack in the country 's recent history .

Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania : `` Go where it hurts ''
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania : Locals do n't get anything from the summer campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote the country day .
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , they understood .
In 2021 , the assembly election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwerin Parliament has already decided earlier this year .
Because stupid as yet , it 's not : Summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that is biting .
The locals , who are to be persuaded by the campaign fighters , are on holiday .
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country , on Usedom , Rügen or Hiddensee , are not locals , so are not allowed to choose the country day .
In addition , there are practical problems : During the holidays , aid workers who hang up posters , blow up balloons , distribute flyers and , in the end , count out votes , only to find out .
Until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania will have to continue campaigning narrowly on the people .
The hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
And it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear for his office .
The SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU in polls .
What 's exciting is how heavily novice AfD is cutting off and what 's left in the end of coalition dust .
Sellering , 66 years old and has been chief executive since 2008 , makes an almost unobtrusive campaign , you can see from his big posters .
He travels through the country , handing out roses and chatting a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did .
Otherwise , Seelering has got cold feet and is blaming Chancellor Merkel for the flourish of the AfD .
Her refugee policy , her `` We create this '' has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists , which will now probably cost him the beautiful office .
The CDU with its top job , the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier , has already seen how it is when you are campaigning in the right place at the wrong time .
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies ; Merkel 's general election constituency is in the north-east .
But the target group did not agree , it was more North Rhine-Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony there as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern .
`` There was probably the majority from other federal states , '' complained Vincent Kokert , general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , recently in NDR .
But it does not pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
Otherwise , the Northeast CDU largely abandons the usual campaign stalls in marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons .
This , Kokert argues , only plays a `` subordinate role . ''
The Union , too , has realised that it is crumbling down the ground in the country , that it has to make a great effort to find a wire to the people again .
It is like the left , the SPD , the Greens : There is little in the country 's expanses .
However , the council of the CDU election campaigner Kokert to his co-workers is also self-exposing : `` You have to go where it hurts , which is where the people are : Dorffeste , Golden Weddings , every birthday party must be used . ''
Because much is at stake , Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly dedicated campaign .
In polls , the Social Democrats were last with 22 per cent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and just ahead of the AfD ( 19 ) .
In the 2011 election , the SPD still clearly won by 35.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , small party with seven per cent in the polls , are likely to make the leap into the country day .
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and largely move their campaign to the Internet .
`` Online campaigning , '' it calls the country 's president , Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green election campaigners are embarking on track-searching for native voting citizens among holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , the front-runner , just curls with a houseboat through the mecklenburgian lakes and still finds it beautiful .
Her impression : `` Election holiday in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment . ''

Nagold : Game and fun at summer release
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social-educational day group / social group work of the child protection group Nagold with their carers on their summer free time in Nussdorf , near Mühlacker .
In the quietly located leisure home Hardtwasldle , the life-loving group was quarantined during the first school holiday week .
Several full-day trips were on the programme .
For one thing , it went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoos .
On the other hand , to Maulbronn , where there was a special children 's guide in the world-famous monastery .
The third outing led to Pforzheim .
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf , the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts .
On the hot days , the group had fun at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn , which invited you to jump , swim and plan .
Children and caregivers have been pampered with their self-prepared meals , such as the Sauren Spätzle , the Seebronner Pfännle , Iselshauser-Bloff , the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese .
In workshops , tanned , beautiful pieces of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman-mill game .
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final `` Bunte evening . ''
On the day of the journey home , the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home .

Escape : `` Every winged woman has experience of sexual violence ''
Sexual violence is almost an everyday occurrence for women who flee on their own .
When they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatised .
A house offers sanctuary .
Four women sit in a large kitchen .
Each has a baby that is no more than a year old .
One has put her little son in his arm .
He guesses with big eyes curious in the room .
His mother stares at the table plate .
Until she realises she 's watching .
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one .
The scene looks normal .
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr .
She is division manager of Condrobs , a carrier for social support services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run , among others .
The four women in the kitchen have fled .
They live in Munich 's north in one of the few decentralised shelters for all-fleeing women and their children in Bavaria .
In January , Condrobs opened up the facility along with Pro Familia and the Munich Women 's Aid .
It has recently been officially opened .
Sixty people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
Men do n't exist - even as visitors .
The exception is a guard at the door .
`` It 's not an exaggeration to say : Every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her escape , '' Bahr says .
`` Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they face torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hopes , '' she told me .
In women , there are other reasons for the escape : `` Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out . ''
In their homeland , they have experience of sexual violence , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
That 's what drives them .
On the run , this continues .
`` The fact that smugglers are asking for a sexual act for a bottle of water , for example , is not uncommon , '' Bahr says .
And the women are on their own , they are not protected by their families .
Those who believe that the end once they arrive in Germany are mistaken , Bahr tells us .
Again , single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused at worst .
As a result , about 90 per cent of women living in accommodation in Munich 's north are traumatised , she estimates .
'Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . '
A lot of women are so used to saying they do n't say anything .
'or they do n't dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big . '
Since they often do n't know to help , there needs to be more accommodation only for them , Bahr claims .
In Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees .
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence , some say no .
In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodation .
Even in Swans , winged women alone are not housed separately , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government .
In Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central France , there are floors or houses only for single women and their children .
The exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men .
In a study published for the committee , it said : `` It is very important that men and women are housed separately . ''
`` Lack of privacy or being able to accommodate men and women together can lead to - continuing - violence against women . ''
In particular , the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women , the study says .
How much women feel this need for protection can be seen in the crowd that exists on the house in Munich .
`` Since getting around that it 's us , we have a long waiting list , '' Bahr says .
You could easily make up a second house .

Clinton 's and Trump 's economic policies in comparison : It 's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade deal - that 's what both Clinton and Trump want .
However , the two US presidential candidates are divided on tax and energy policy , as well as on a matter of principle .
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental , more philosophical difference .
The , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
He himself , by contrast , would be very different , Trump claims .
He will drive back regulations massively , and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , by contrast , says : The state has certain tasks to perform , he has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
That 's why taxes would be increased for the rich , she says .
Interestingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
In the need to be invested , Trump and Clinton say almost eloquently .
The Democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strongly opposed , for example , by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republican Party .
So on Trump , there could still be bipartisan discussions .
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ramp up coal production in the United States .
Oil production is also expected to be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate change agreement he wants to announce .
Clinton , by contrast , explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment programme , demanding : `` A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs . ''
'it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . '
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
TPP , the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement , both do not want to sign .
At the same time , however , both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
Those are then also expected to be paid better , asking about Clinton .
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 is a pittance .
He wants to increase it to $ 15 an hour .
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear : Once he says : The minimum wage has to go up , then he says he should not be changed .
But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps .
On one side is Trump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
His critics keep telling him that would only increase the budget deficit .
On the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to require the rich to pay more tax , and whose critics say : More tax is not the solution either .

A controversial baseball star resigns
Tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. baseball star in best days from Base to Base .
After his emotional resignation announcement , the 41-year-old pro will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays .
'i love this game and this team . '
`` I say 'Goodbye ' to both , '' declared the 14-time All-Star Game contestant of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Three times , Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signature under a 10-year contract gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
By the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach in the future - at full salary .
As a player , it paid Rodriguez a long time with performance .
With 696 homeruns , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( `` Runs '' ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees made some milestones .
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two other baseball players have similar values in the key stats .
But in the glory hall of the baseball , the 41-year-old is still unlikely to be included .
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname `` A-Rod '' - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
Back in 2009 , the superstar admitted to `` ESPN '' to have taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 , he was banned for 211 matches due to involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect to have received performance-enhancing funds for years through an anti-ageing clinic in South Florida .
After a legal battle , the ban was still reduced to 162 encounters .
`` The league might even have done me a favour for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , '' Rodriguez said sweetly at the time .
Even his farewell days do n't go noisily .
While many baseball legends have yet to get the big stage in their last few games , Rodriguez frequently had to sit on the bench .
'My job does n't include a farewell tour . '
`` My job involves trying to win every game , '' corroborated Yankees Coach Joe Girardi .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is demoted to the relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , received sympathy defections from fans from the Yankees arch-rival Boston Red Sox .
`` We want A-Rod , '' sang the supporters in the 4-9 defeat to the Rodriguez team .

Pokémon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that 's worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens , has been lamented by many in the last decade .
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active .
The time on screen was initially on the TV , then on video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
So it 's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer , of course , to the Pokémon Go-Wahn , an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990 `` s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , interest fell somewhat before the release of the game in the United States , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded .
Within days , Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons , who are tracked down with a GPS and , once found , can be `` photographed '' ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or `` captured . ''
A generation that played the game when she was even younger , joined the loo and jumped for the search from the sofa .
In the US , the game led to a significant rise in moves that put the `` average '' person back every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users , told The Washington Post recently that within two days of the game 's launch , the number of tracked people who train for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
The company does n't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement .
Many public health awareness campaigns that want to get people to `` take 30 minutes '' to `` get off the sofa '' and `` be active every day '' met on deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable .
Yet the importance of sport can not be overrated .
If you do sport regularly , you reduce your chances of developing cancer or depression .
Physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it causes people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
Thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people even join in the hunt for new friendships .
As always , there are also grumpy game-changers who always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could run against a door .
What 's it like ?
A breakthrough has occurred .
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports , as this game does .
The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
However , due to Pokemon 's success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Case of illness : When paid by the organiser
Diseased holidaymakers will only get money back after their journey if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
However , this is only the case when more than 10 per cent of guests have been shown to show the same symptoms .
In the negotiated case , a family was seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday .
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
Her illness led holidaymakers to a faulty sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater .
The family felt the trip was deficient with this - and complained against the organiser .
In court , the plaintiffs had no success .
It is true that the treatment plant was defective .
But the organiser only learned about it shortly before leaving the plaintiffs .
He had to assume by then that the seawater was fine .
So he did not violate his information obligations , according to the ruling .
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water .
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion to each other - is part of the general risk of death .
Of 691 guests , only 38 were ill .

Russia 's Putin flaunts Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly sacked his chief of staff , Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov was part of Putin 's closest trust group for many years .
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport .
In a statement from the Kremlin , it says that Putin , without giving reasons , `` ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . ''
Anton Vaino , who had been Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo .
On the Kremlin 's website , it says ( in Russian ) that he was later a protocol chief and chief of staff of the government staff .
Speaking about his appointment , he said to Putin : `` Thank you for your confidence . ''
I think that it is the government 's most important task to support your work as Head of State regarding draft laws and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
Convince the smiling faces ?
This move has mystified Moscow .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest confidants of Vladimir Putin and works as he does for Soviet intelligence , the KGB .
As chief of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
At a meeting with President Putin , which aired on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning at his own request .
But despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle ?
No one knows at the moment .
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president at one time wants to guide Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism .
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin 's website , Ivanov said `` it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - arduous post for four years .
As it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov took the post in December 2011 .
Previously , he was deputy prime minister and defence minister .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the State Security Service KGB .
In the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) that replaced the KGB , Ivanov was appointed his deputy .
When Putin came to power , he named Ivanov as one of five people he most trusted .
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin 's second term , as Putin 's third term would have violated the constitution .
But that post was taken by another , close ally of Putin , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three-and-a-half years later .

31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water-purpose association `` Veitensteingruppe , '' Ruppert Göller , is retiring .
The association is considered `` Bavarian-wide exemplary . ''
A small fringed drinking water association as a role model for the big water producers .
So it was said some time ago in the original tone in a post by the Bavarian broadcaster .
Soon after , the water forum of the government of Unterfranken honored the Zweckverband .
The work of the Veitensteingroup was `` Bavaria-wide as exemplary . ''
Behind all this is Rupert Göller , who has been a staff member for 31 years , including 28 years as managing director .
Now he was retired at the age of 65 .
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitensteingroup , based in Kottendorf , municipality of Breitbrunn , promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants .
Member communities are the municipalities of Kirchlouder , Breitbrunn , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach .
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
The current chairman , Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director in 1988 .
`` His duties have been very diverse and they stretched from the waterline construction and maintenance work through office and organisational activities , budgeting , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , '' the chairwoman said .
As an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the rehabilitation of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the reconnection of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water lines .
There has been no standstill and there have been repeated innovations , because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
In her laudato , she praised Göllers ' loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
He has used himself with a lot of heartache for his water-ring association and he has really lived the water-ring association as if it were his own company .
A few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the concept of success of the Veitensteingroup to the nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken .
He received a great deal of praise and praise for that .
Rupert Göller , for his part , praised water keeper Alfons Griebel , who worked with him for 28 years .
He 's the best water keeper and he was a loyal crap .
Together we were an unbeatable team .
As highlights from his point of view , he described the fountain construction and the restructuring of the purpose-building association .
The biggest challenge and the most difficult effort , however , was the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlouder on a January 3 .
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the towns could be provided with water .
Once again , the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained , because the Pettstadt reservoir was filled with hoses .
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel striker from Lauter , who is taking over the succession of Rupert Göller .

Olympics 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught : Because of a positive doping test , weightlifter Adrian Zielinski may not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases .
An evaded athlete would have almost won a medal .
Before the seventh day of competition , the first official doping cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa of Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have been tested positive and ruled out in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics contests , these messages come at an unstoppable time .
In the case of Chen , last Sunday , the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid was shown to be used as a masking tool for doping substances .
The International Sports Court of CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time .
On Sunday , the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100m butterfly , only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen would have been expected to take part in the precincts over 50m freeway .
Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
The national federation takes the matter `` very seriously and requires Chen 's full cooperation in the investigations , '' Xinhua quoted from a statement : `` We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the ruling . ''
For the first time in history , it is no longer the IOC but the CAS responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases .
Also on the night of Rio , the news leaked about the positive sample at Danekowa , saying the 33-year-old went on the offense himself .
`` I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , '' saying this was `` an incredible shock , '' she told Bulgarian TV station BNT .
She is innocent , `` the only explanation could be dietary supplements , '' the athletics explained .
According to the report , the banned substance is said to be the blood-doping drug EPO .
Danekowa was provisionally suspended , according to BNT , the B sample is also said to have already been positive .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister Bojko Borisov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete .
`` I do n't understand why athletes do n't draw the right conclusions , '' he said : `` We Bulgarians are under observation so many have already been ruled out . ''
For example , all weightlifters from the chronically doped nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
On Friday , the case was also known as `` Adrian Zielinski , '' the London-based Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tomasz tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier .
Both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
Before the start of athletics , especially the Danekowa case is another major blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
The world governing body , IAAF , had banned the complete Russian team except for an exception due to systematic doping , including the runner-up Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
In addition , in the swimming sport , the earlier offences in China had caused fierce clashes between the athletes as well .
So Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly .
`` Sun Yang pinches purple . ''
`` When I see the podium over 200m freeway , I want to pass , '' Lacourt said on French radio .
Sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton .
`` I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters , '' this one said .
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese championships , but only had to sit down a three-month ban .

It made the Syrians the shining symbol in the horrors of war .
However , as a hero , he never saw himself , saying , according to Bild : `` For me , this is the real jihad . ''
'If I 'm dying to save lives , I think God sees in me a martyr . '

The helicopters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
A woman and two children died , seven people suffering from breathlessness .
`` We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that not children play with it , '' the image quoted his last words before he died .
The Assad regime 's deadly bomb had been intended to hit terrorists .

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
If there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Trump already has an alternative video .
He then just goes on holiday .
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November , he would be relatively indifferent : `` Ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , '' the Republican candidate said in a phone interview with US television channel CNBC .
If it was n't enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that 's OK , Trump said .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market .
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
It was thicker and bigger , so it was n't well in hand .
On the contrary , it was pretty knock-on .
The built-in memory initially was eight megabytes , which would be enough today for roughly two selfies with high resolution .
An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes .
The `` Nokia 9000 Communicator '' came into business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone .
For a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
Twenty years ago , however , the Communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as an `` office in Westentaschenformat . ''
In fact , the new mobile phone could do a lot for then standards : SMS and e-mails could be sent and received , even by fax was to reach the Communicator .
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser , albeit agonisingly slow .
A calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the phone could be folded up in the same way as a laptop .
Then found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
Pretty proud was the price : 2700 D-Mark , which is about $ 1400 .
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was $ 392 in 2015 .
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
Everything has changed since then .
The smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and settled .
Today , the market is dominated by suppliers , all of whom came much later than Nokia .
Always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday .
In 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
About 1.4 billion devices have been sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units .
Global sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros .
This is followed by the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
Around the smartphone , an entire industry has since emerged .
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007 , at the time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on Mac World the introduction of the iPhone .
He promised three devices in one : A music player , a phone and an internet communicator , all by touch screen easy to use .
Apple 's winning streak began , even today the iPhone is the group 's most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , which dominated the market , had the sequel .
They eventually disappeared , Blackberry has struggled .
The ire now has Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung .
The smartphone is self-evident 20 years after its invention .
On average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
`` We all need to learn to move the smartphone away , too , '' said just Janina Ball , in charge of the Siemens board of staff .
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .

Building ground in double pack
With issues around building , the council has focused on the most recent meeting .
With relief , the panel took the message from Mayor Robert Putz that `` finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . ''
The sale of land in the residential areas `` Straslweg '' and `` Schönau-West '' ( Binderstraße - expansion section 1 ) is no longer an obstacle to the sale of land in the residential areas `` Straslweg '' and `` Schönau-West . ''
The local council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and troubled seniors alike .
As it was said , builders can now report to the town hall , about the awarding of the plots , the council is expected to advise at its September meeting .
In order to be able to comply with requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises , linked to job creation , the local council decided to amend the land-use plan , which was only re-created in the spring of this year , in sub-areas .
For example , in the area of Unterzeitlarn , the industrial area already designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of State Route 2112 .

What the Jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook .
In December 2014 , he first picked up gold at the short-track world championships in Doha , while at the same time setting his first world record .
Now , former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has faced criticism from his ex-teammates via Facebook .
`` In a country where an Olympic champion gets a £20,000 premium and a jungle king £150,000 , no one should be surprised about missing medals , '' the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on the night of Friday .
The support system in swimming is bad , but the doping controls are very good .
In this way , we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely or even operate on the subject of doping .
`` I 'm not saying that the controls should be stopped here , '' he continued .
If he wanted to start a comeback , Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency of Germany ( NADA ) .
That is exactly how we should keep it with countries .
`` Anyone who can not be controlled a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS by independent inspectors of WADA / FINA may not be allowed to participate , '' claims the election hamburger , who now runs an ice cream shop .

The right-wing `` identitarian movement '' has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
According to several national offices , the constitutionalists in the federal government have also put the group under observation .
`` We see in the 'identitarian movement ' evidence of aspirations against the liberal democratic basic order , '' said Constitutional Court Judge Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
In this way , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffused in an extremist way .
That 's why we 're watching the movement now as well .
The `` Identitarian Movement '' is a grouping with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 .
It opposes `` multiculturalism , '' `` uncontrolled mass immigration '' and the `` loss of its own identity through alienation . ''
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hesse , Berlin , Baden-Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the `` identitarian . ''
Maassen said his authority was working closely with the state 's offices in the decision .
`` Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement ' are trying to pick their target group out of where it stands , '' the constitutional chief said .
In general , extremists try to address them with youthful language , often with popping music .
This would be done by Islamists as well as right-wing extremists .
This is not a good advertisement for your own cause .
The propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally .
Young people are particularly vulnerable .
This is dangerous .
Most recently , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the `` identitarian '' to AfD politicians .
Maassen said he has no knowledge of this .
For constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
It comes down to whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people who are extremist , changes its direction and becomes so extremist .
The decisive factor , then , is whether such individuals have a controlling influence on the party .
This is not apparent .
Referring to the significant increase in legally-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters , Maassen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context .
But we have found in the past few years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures .
There was the group 'Old School Society ' or the Friday group .
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups , or micro-groups , are planning attacks against asylum seekers , refugee shelters , or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives .
However , a German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is unrecognisable .
The previous groups were created at the regional level or on social networks .
Concerned , Maaßen said that many assaults went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene .
That is the worrying thing .
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene .
`` So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who were perhaps politically indifferent or elected , for example , by the CDU , the SPD or the left , who were then radicalised by right-wing extremist sentiment . ''

Despite doping : These athletes still have medal chances at Olympics in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin had already been banned twice for doping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - whistleblower Julia Stepanowa may not start in Rio .
Other outperformed athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting for medals in Rio .
The issue of doping continues to make the headlines at the Rio Olympics .
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa , who had been suing her starting right just before the Games after a doping ban , was mercilessly booed and booed at her start ( 100 metres chest ) .
It offered a bizarre scenery : With a set smile , she was still stumbling into the hall and had provoked with her appearance .
When determined that she was not going to fetch gold , the audience erupted into a jubilant storm .
But there are still numerous other athletes to launch despite doping past at the Rio Olympics .
Here 's an overview :
Justin Gatlin ( 100 , 200 , 4x100m relay / USA ) : The 34-year-old is among the most controversial figures in athletics .
He had already been banned two times for doping ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
Since his spell , the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger to Usain Bolt .
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce ( 100 , 4x100m relay / Jamaica ) : The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit down a six-month ban in 2010 after she was shown taking the painkiller oxycodon .
She had strong toothache after surgery , defending the 29-year-old .
Sandra Perkovic ( Diskus / Croatia ) : In 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 , tested positive for the banned stimulant drug methylhexanamine .
Perkovic denied the wistful take and was banned for six months .
The four furthest litters this year go to the account of the big gold favourite .
LaShawn Merritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x400m relay / USA ) : The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400m , was tested positive in 2010 and banned for 21 months .
A means of penis augmentation was responsible , Merritt pleaded .
This year , the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400m the fastest man in the world so far .
Iwan Tichon ( Hammersmith , Belarus ) : Hardly an athlete has been awarded so many medals .
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later , after he was found guilty of testosterone doping .
The now 40-year-old also had to make Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the 2006 Euro title because of testosterone abuse .
He also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games as a result of a ruling by the International Sports Court , CAS .
At 80.04 m , he is ranked second in the world rankings .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : The world record holder and gold favourite only tested positive in May , but may still start in Rio .
At the 29-year-old world champion , evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement was found , the ban by the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and ran as early as July 13 .

Asocial family destroyed in front of Delogovernment social flat in Saltash , Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing estate after a Delogovernment was charged with damages of £50,000 because it had terrorised their neighbours .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash , Cornwall , after a long list of complaints .
After being forcibly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition .
The walls pointed out gaping holes , wooden dials were torn up , rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls .
The family were resettled and it is believed she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy , who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing , said that she feared the home would no longer be repaired .
She said : `` It has been an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do n't have to live in this way .
There are many things to consider , as this property will probably be regarded as a not so beautiful part of Cornwall .
The family is notorious and their reputation is too .
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and police said that the terror that had been inflicted on the family included street fights with baseball bats , intimidating residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive shouting , disputes and floods .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the rental contract , got an order for antisocial behaviour in June .
In some rooms of the house , which will be demolished in some circumstances , old rubbish was found
It was found in the property where drugs were traded in the past , the wooden dials were torn up
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly had to call the police
Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner violently from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out .
The Delogovernment was cheered by relieved neighbours who said that their lives were made hell .
One said : `` They were n't snapping around anyone . ''
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
'This morning we could n't sleep . '
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we 're not used to that !
Now that they 're finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities .
The family lived in the house , to which police were called at regular intervals , 20 years on
On the overgrown side of the community house , rubbish and old toys were thrown down
He added : `` It is a disgrace that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as a Delogovernment is always the final step considering Cornwall Housing .
This was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible to watch for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that has been done by my team , the Devon and Cornwall Police , as well as members of the community who have bravely joined us and have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the house 's bedrooms according to the Delogovernment
Workers at the home administration will now have to clean up rubbish mountains that surround the house
In 2014 , police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and cash in excess of £1,700 .
Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug in trade review .
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son , Lee Skeldon , who was killed in a car crash in 2013 .
After being without shelter , it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
Many room walls of the house were coated with graffiti .
Police say she will deloculate tenants who do n't adhere to the house order
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said that the Delogovernment was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not abide by the house order .
`` This goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach , as well as to those who have been harmed by such behaviour , '' she said .
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Woman overpowered in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night .
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman went overboard in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight .
A woman put himself on the road in the dark `` in an act of desperation '' and were hit by several cars , police in Vaud said .
It is obvious that a Swiss woman , aged 49 , who was overpowered by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
She still passed away on the ground .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said police , who are urging these as well as any witnesses to the incident to sign up .
An investigation has been opened , which is a `` logical '' step in such a situation , Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen if any of the drivers will be displayed .
Was a collision avoidable ?
That 's something the prosecutor has to decide , `` Hofstetter said .
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable .
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists do n't have to assume that a pedestrian walks on the highway in the middle of the night , as stated in the newspaper .
Last year , a policewoman was acquitted of negligent homicide after she overpowered and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014 .
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has become unconscious on the street , arresting the court .
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a `` completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation , '' the judge said .
Anyone who has any further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .

Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable .
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer , with some colleagues , was looking for a bit of variety with a walkout on the beach .
For the 58-year-old , it was a first .
Chio : 'Golden sports pyramid ' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes , the horses were reminded of their holidays , they joked in the fast gallop home to the feeding comforters .
One kilometre at that pace , I 've been scared .
`` It was n't a good experience , '' Langer says .
And that ended the riding career again .
On Saturday , Germany 's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses .
He left with his family over the plant of the ALRV , on a horse he swung not even for photo purposes .
Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO .
The reason was quite convincing .
German Sport Relief handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid .
The likeable athlete is not lacking in awards .
Federal treasurer , silver laurel leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ...
Even the British Queen has already adored him .
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
In Aachen , he met the first prize winner , Hans Günter Winkler , on Saturday .
`` This award means a lot to me , '' says Langer , `` because it is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social engagement . ''
For decades , Langer has been promoting the young .
And so he also gave the prize money of $ 25,000 right away .
With 15 other outstanding athletes , the two-time U.S. Masters winner was inducted into the `` Hall of Fame of German Sports '' on Saturday .
Among the excluded are athletics Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt , Turner Eberhard Gienger , the fussy Cornelia Hanisch , Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt , the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe , the Judoka Frank Wieneke , the Judoka Frank Wieneke , the jumper Alwin Shockemöhle and posthumous handyman Erhard Wunderlich .
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday .
After the official part , the illustrious company wandered into the jumping stadium , where the Lavazza price ran .
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals .

`` A generation protesting '' in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
Witnesses say that tens of protestors were killed during the clashes with police during gunfire .
Is Ethiopia about to collapse ?
Over the past decade , it has been one of Africa 's most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy .
But in recent months , protests against the government rocked the country and expanded into more and more areas .
Last week , thousands of people stormed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
The government 's response was ruthless , according to human rights organizations .
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed on tens of unarmed protesters .
Videos in circulation about the protests , which are believed to be from the last or early this year , show how security guards beat young people with sticks , while these have been forced to make a handstand against a wall .
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now demanding an in-depth investigation .
`` It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , '' said Rashid Abdi , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
After Nigeria , Ethiopia is Africa 's most populous country and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region , particularly in Somalia ; few countries in Africa , if any , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia 's economy expanded at a considerable pace .
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital , Addis Ababa .
The streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously cited repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissidents effectively silenced .
Many were sent into exile or sent to prison , killed or driven into the expanses of the desert .
But that could change .
`` If you suppress people and these have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , '' said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
All the youth are protesting .
A generation protesting .
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament .
At the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea ; a battle over this jagged , controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front , which have been more or less defeated in recent years , could exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves .
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of crashing beneath the surface .
The first seems harmless : Smartphones .
It was only in recent years that very many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and Internet services improved .
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they reside .
Several young Ethiopians said that they so gathered to protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since aeons , the Amharas , who come from Ethiopia 's predominantly Christian highlands , have prospered in politics and economics , while exploiting the Oromos , many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas .
But that , too , is just changing .
`` We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella , '' said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of Oromos .
The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group , who make up around 6 per cent of the population and who are dominant in the military , intelligence , trade and politics .
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was Ethiopia 's prime minister for 17 years until his death on an undisclosed illness in 2012 .
He was viewed as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
Analysts say he was particularly adept at perceiving early signs of discontent and using special representatives to process opponents and make them harmless .
`` The current regime lacks this fundamental skill , '' said Mr. Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopia 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles .
Unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray .
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005 , after thousands protested against elections that , according to analysts , were seemingly botched by the government and subsequently stolen .
During the subsequent raids , many protestors were killed , even though it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest went over relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction .
But it appears that this has not prevented an intensification of the internal resentment of the Ethiopian Government .
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month , protestors in Gondar , an amhardy city , attacked Tigray , and hatred of the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media .
Analysts say that the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position .
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed that base .
While the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
`` This , '' Mr. Abdi said , `` is a very thin tightrope . ''

Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is expected to be reduced to a back-office role , according to the bank 's chief executive .
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank 's global ambitions .
The bank has since distanced itself when it nearly collapsed and rescued eight years ago .
During this time , brand strategists have used `` RBS '' to protect other end-consumer financial brands .
She supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship , from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now it has decided to focus more national brands .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all RSB references , devolved headquarters and stock market listing will switch to NatWest .
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other , smaller brands for retail banking that will be given more prominence - Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's Military Bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire .
He told BBC Scotland : `` The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands . ''
When the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became a global brand .
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals .
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our staff will work with customers under these brands .
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
`` It 's time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? '' The chief executive said .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see a lot of changes .
We can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was `` sarcasm ''
Donald J. Trump on Friday sought to dispel the latest controversy that surrounds his campaign by suggesting that his oft-repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the `` founders '' of the Islamic State group had not been serious .
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate in a clear and understandable way with the American public .
It also brings his associates , who seek to protect him during an eventful period , in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all .
After making the suggestion at a campaign event Wednesday night , Mr. Trump ruffled back in relation to the claim on Thursday , insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic .
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation was utterly serious .
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump soften the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate did n't want to know anything about it .
The latest storm of criticism boils down to Mr. Trump , while he has tried to deflect the focus of his campaign because of falling poll numbers on the economic situation .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again .
Speaking on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has already put sarcasm to his defense .
At the end of July , he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but he later declared `` Of course I meant the sarcastic . ''
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rustle back as needed .
`` I think it 's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , '' clarify `` depending on what the reaction is , '' said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates .
However , I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in various ways .
Instead of defying the tone for presidential elections , Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone as his poll numbers have continued to decline .
A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist , which was released Friday , showed a lead with a large lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida .
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks , he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his sense of humour .
But while he is increasingly the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's jokes have put his loyal associates in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him , regardless of how provocative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , a former mayor of New York and one of Trump 's most prominent advocates , made a big effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview Thursday .
`` I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , '' so Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned on the accuracy of Mr. Trump 's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them backbenchers , utterly wrong and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state , allowed ISIS to spread out by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East .
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media , accusing them of riding on each of his words and being biased against him .
He derided the `` poor , pitiful '' television experts trying to understand him and said , `` You ca n't do it ! . ''
Some of the Democrats spooked over Mr. Trump 's apology as just one more proof that he was unsuitable for president .

Donald Trump acknowledges ″ huge problems ″ in campaign
The US Republican leadership is plagued by massive worries about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the previous Republican stronghold of Utah .
A rare moment in which the normally pompous and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns , as correspondents reported .
Having thrown 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race , there are now growing doubts about his success in the battle for the White House .
`` We have huge problems in Utah , '' Trump told evangelical Christians he asked for support in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
Blaming false reports about his candidacy , he again took on his well-known media scorn .
Republican strongholds wobble
Utah is normally a safe bank for Republicans .
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June , Trump and his rival from the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , equalised .
Other institutions see Trump ahead , though not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk .
In an interview on CNBC , Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton 's advance again : `` Just as I 've done so far . ''
And snaps afterwards : This will `` either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . ''
He does n't do anything other than `` telling the truth . ''
If it was n't enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that 's OK , Trump said .
Then I return to a very good way of life .
According to press reports , the Trump party is said to have threatened to scrap funds to support his campaign should he not be able to present better polls .
Instead , they want to give more support to the Republican candidates for Congress .

North eseeoil workers resume talks , set strike
Labour disputes regarding pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all the warring parties are set for a new round of talks at the table , negotiators said .
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been conducted intermittently on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
`` Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute , '' it said in a joint statement .
We will hold some full-day sessions over the next few weeks , which will start early next year to re-address the problems .
Unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against potential pay cuts of up to 30 per cent .
Wood Group this year cut rates to its Contractors in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
The company 's council cut follows a 10 per cent decline for onshore contractors in 2014 .
The company said that additional cuts will give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn .
Shell , for its part , has sacked thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had been exacerbated by the decision by Britons in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with working-class leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea for a generation .
The North Sea is important to the regional economy , he said .
`` In the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , '' he said in a statement .
In 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of about $ 7 billion over the past five years .

Improving the flow of traffic on the motorway
It stumps regularly on the bypass - here 's a picture of November .
But this is about to change : The legal absentee is to be extended .
This is good news for all car ­ drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every night when they drive through the highway ­ feeder ( A 43 ) .
The state-run road construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the exit of Weseler Street , the right-wing lane by 700 metres .
Motorists can then walk directly from Hammer Street on the right .
The big advantage : The traffic is divided early , improving the overall process on the busiest section of the Federal Highway 51 .
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West .
The carriageway on the feeder is annoying motorists especially between 5pm and 7pm .
On weekdays , the backlog extends to the bridge over the Alberslog path and sometimes beyond .
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the exit of Weseler Strasse .
From here , traffic is channelled only one-way through the motorway bridge .
The second track had to be built back just over three-quarters years ago .
The reason : Static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absorb heavy goods traffic in a two-way way .
How long this bottleneck and the associated day-to-day congestion will continue , the relevant national operation can not say .
However , with years to be expected : Because the bridge has an official residual benefit period until 2034 .
For the extension of the legal absentee , the country 's operations deliberately selected the traffic-weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected .
Traffic will run one-way past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .

Mahaj Brown , 6 , 'wiped out by bullets ' , survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say that the 6-year-old boy was fired in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot .
The boy 's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown .

Mecklenburg power : 'going where it hurts
Strange Mecklenburg powers : the locals get nothing back from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North North West West are not allowed to choose the country .
In Mecklenburg , they understood .
In 2021 , the land election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy parliament has already decided earlier this year .
Because than before , it 's not about : summer holidays , heat and rural election campaign - biting .
The locals to be convinced by campaigners are on holiday .
Most holidaymakers who are in the country on Usedom , Russia or Hiddensee are not locals , so they may not vote the country .
These are practical problems : in the holidays , workers who hang posters hang up , blowing balloons , distributing flyers and counting at the end of votes , only painful to feature .
By the time of September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg Pomeranians once still have to campaign barely past themselves over .
The hot period , if you can say that ever , has just begun .
And it 's also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear for his office .
The SPD , since 1998 's strongest party , is now clear in polls behind the CDU .
Exciting , how strongly New AfD cuts down and what remains left on the end of the coalition .
Celering , 66 years old and since 2008 chief executives , makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign , seeing its big posters .
He travels through land , distributing roses and chatting a little with people , just as it also did his legendary worthy predecessor Harald Ringstorff .
Otherwise , sailoring has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel blamed on the bloom of the AfD .
Their refugee policy , her we create that , have accelerated the rise of legal populists , which will probably cost him the beautiful office .
The CDU with its top candidate , Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigning at the wrong time at the right place .
She has invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to big rallies ; Merkel federal election constituency is in the Northeast .
But the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine Westphalians , Berliners and Saxony than Mecklenburger and premeditation .
As there was probably the majority from other federal states , Vincent cocktails , general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg , recently in the NDR .
But it is also a pity no one from other corners of Germany to listen once Angela Merkel .
Otherwise , the northeastern CDU is largely renouncing the usual campaign standings on marketplaces and before shopping centres with sunshines and aerial balloons .
That , so thinks costume , play only a 'subdued role. ``
The union has also noted that on the country , it takes away the base that it needs to be very exhausted again to find a wire to people .
You go like the left , the SPD , the Greens : barely available in the expansions of the country .
However , the CDU campaigner 's concern to his comrades is also self-defensive : `` you have to go where it hurts , namely where people are : village festivals , Golden Weddings , every birthday party must be used . ''
Because much is at stake , Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
In polls , the Social Democrats were last with 22 per cent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just before the AfD ( 19 ) .
At the 2011 election , the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 per cent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , small party with seven per cent in the polls , are likely to create the jump in the country .
They make out of holiday distress a modern virtue and move their campaigning largely to the internet .
Online campaigning , calling it the country 's chairman Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green campaigners are encountering lane search for domestic voting citizens among the holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , the top candidate , is straight with a houseboat through the mecklenburgic lakes and it also finds it still beautiful .
Her impression : 'polling holidays in Mecklenburg is not a punishment. ``

Donald Trump campaign charged after staff allegedly moved gun
New York : Donald Trump 's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after her told her campaign leader for North Carolina in February was aimed at a staff while travelling in a jeep in February .
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the County Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
Bordini admitted for money that the matter would be settled internally before realising that this would not happen .
The campaign leader , Earl Philip , drew a pistol , put his right index finger on the deduction , and rammed the run in Vincents knee chair , gave Bordini in his charge .
Having complained to the local and regional campaign line , Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip , he admitted in the indictment .
Weapons do n't have to be fired for damage , `` admitted Bordini .
The charge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered an uproar when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the Second Amendment people should take action - if his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and judges should appoint .
Trump 's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not stack up for violence .
Bordini 's complaint requires damages from the campaign for breaching care duty and from Philip because of bodily injury and leading psychological damage .
Trump 's press secretary Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion .
Attempts to contact Philip equally failed .
WCCC , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
On calls at its consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been responded .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far .
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc. , 16-C-14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

Future of Portland 's meltdown because of lifting the energy contract is questionable
The future of Portland 's aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts , as the delivery energy company reported .
This move followed the government 's decision in Victoria earlier this year to give no further subsidies to the operation of the facility .
A subsidy set for 20 years is running in November .
Up to 2,000 jobs at the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake .
No fewer than 2,000 jobs directly , as well as indirect - could be endangered in closure .
In addition , it could come to domino effects as the melting about 10 per cent of Victoria 's entire power generation .
2014 , Alcoa closed the Point Henry meltdown , leading to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alcoa 's meltdown in Portland loses money and risks closing .
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the power price for the facility .
AGL , which delivers the large aluminium melting with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley , announced that it assumes that three other owners will terminate their contracts .
The facility is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina , of which Chinese companies CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares .
AGL assumes the facility will continue to operate in Portland , which includes another physical demand for electricity through the meltdown , `` the company said .
AGL continues to say that the contracts were so-called security businesses , which should have entered into force from November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will end in 2017 .
Of course , AGC assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year , `` the power supplier said .
Any potential implications for revenue on AGL from the DJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale currency prices .
AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $ 187 million in an expectation of a termination .
Alcoa said the decision to book the contracts will not affect the capacity of Alcoas ... or guaranteeing power supplies to melting. ``
The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if it 's still guilty of a statement why it resigned from the contract .
Analysts warn of the industry 's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle .
In reference to the statements of the analysts earlier this week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumed around 600 megawatts and Tomago annually around 900 megawatts to electricity .
Should both facilities disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the power market .
And for us as an electricity producer , that would n't be good , `` he said .

Olympia : threesty fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya 's athletes are threatened after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
The International Olympic Committee told to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
A Kenyan official had told that the former sprinter and today 's coach , John Anzrah , made a urine sample under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich 's name .
This has been reported by the team management of Kenya by the doping inspectors .
The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC to inform the case to engage its own investigations , an IAAF spokesman said .
Depending on the results of the investigation and the IOC 's following measures , the IAAF will make an assessment , `` it said in an IAAF statement .
He ( American ) has gone to the doping control station and has spent themselves as Ferguson Rotich , the test made and signed , `` explained Kenyan chief executive de Mission Stephan Arap Soi .
He was in possession of the athlete 's accreditation , which was on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency .
Ferguson Rotich was in Beijing 's World Cup fourth over 800 metres in 2015 .
Four days earlier , Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
He is expected to be informed against money payments athletes of his country over upcoming doping tests .
According to media reports , he should have been arrested in his return at Nairobi airport .
Kenya faces IOC after numerous doping offences have been under special observation for a long time .
When announcing the IOC launched more than 2,000 doping target controls before the Rio Games , unusually previously pointed out that particularly athletes will be targeted from Kenya and Russia .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had played a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Games , creating an anti-doping law and a functioning control system .
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympic begins .
In a row , WADA Kenya took off from the list of countries whose doping compliance is compliant with WADA rules .
Kenya is considered a big runner nation .
The country 's athletes won at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing most medals .
In a series of television reports from the ARD , allegations have been raised repeatedly that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he employed her in Russian athletics .
In doing so , it was possible to prove that in this sport , it was covered and systematically doped .
Russia 's athletes were then ruled out from the summer games .

De Maizière said after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July , many people would have concerns about further attacks .
The state had to respond calmly and determinedly at the same time on terror risks .
Sure : our country will not answer the offenders ' violence with hatred and divide .
We wo n't give this triumph to the terrorists .
If criminals would have to leave faster , though , it increases security and also strengthens the population 's consent for refugee policy .
De Maizière wants to reach an implementation of the proposals until the 2017 federal election .
He also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces , and that 's in medium-sized magnitude over several years. ``
Sympathy for terrorism must be back under punishment .
Video surveillance is intended to improve the gun right that is mainly hampered by the purchase of weapons on the internet .
The last much discussed silence for doctors is expected to be preserved after de Maizière 's words .
However , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to seek solutions as to how to reduce citizens ' endangerment , he said with a view for mental health conspicuously .
To counter a radicalisation of refugees , the minister holds better social care for necessity .
Teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people .
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Darknet ) plans de Maizière the use of covert investigators .
SPD chief Gabriel said : `` the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase safety . ''
It is important that the Home Secretary spoke clearly against actionism .
This was a slap for the sniper in the CDU / CSU , Gabriel told the newspapers of the spark media group ( Friday ) .
De Maizière had rejected calls from the Union after a burgeoning ban and the abolition of double nationality before .
A general ban on full-vealing has been troubled for constitutionally problematic .
You ca n't ban everything you reject and I reject the wearing of the burka .
Talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
Green chief Simone Peter threw off the minister that he wants to simulate power and action capability with still new anti-terrorist packages .
Left-hander Bernd Riexinger said : `` fleet spells and a tightening of the right of residency bring no more security to people in this country . ''

Police : 3 victims shot in series murder of music listening in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the fatal attacks for the first time in a decade in the first serial murder of Phoenix , while heard in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis 's daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway , the authorities said .
The offender fired eight shots from a hand firearm while he stood on the front side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , in the report .
Police announced that the three-time murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery , as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix Sgt . Jonathan Howard 's police spokesman said the shooting led the investigators to be a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
Overall , predominantly in Hispanic residential areas , seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in nine attacks .
's happening in a residential area in front of a house , `` told Howard of KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , earlier this month .
It is believed the suspect used several vehicles , including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later .
Liners , 31 , and Ellis daughter Maleah still died on the ground .
One witness told police that it was n't unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before three-time murder and which will be expected that it was the work of the serial killer .
Investigators found cartridges and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the motor room .

North Sea workers take talks again , set strike
Labour fights regarding pay for North Sea oil workers are being suspended , while all parties are putting on the table for a new round of conversations , negotiators said .
Strikes against oil service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea , which will be operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
Wood Group , as well as the Unite and RMT unions , can confirm that we have agreed to reshape the delivery process of the current dispute , `` it said in a common statement .
We will be holding some full-day sessions in the next few weeks that will start early next year to reassess the problems .
Unions said their latest strike , which is the first over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 per cent .
Wood Group has cut this year 's rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent because of negative market pressure .
The company 's council cut follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014 .
The company said that additional cuts to the company are giving the needed room to come through the downturn .
Shell has sacked for his part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas businesses into up to 10 countries as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its merger with British energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had strengthened by the British 's decision to leave the European Union in June .
Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met with workers earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that had taken place for a generation in the North Sea .
The North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
In the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , `` he said in a statement .
In 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea compared with an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years .

Military leadership distort ISIS intelligence information , presents committee of Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it allowed actual conditions on the ground , an investigative committee of Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
The preliminary report , created by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Force Committee , intelligence committees and anti-budget committees , reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed its assessments on the U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
The Central Command , briefly Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` Intelligence information that was typically dismissed by senior CENTCOM commanders , regularly drawing a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground were allowed and were more positive than analysis of other news services , a newspaper article quoted the report .
What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analysis is presented by our political leaders , `` stated Ken Calvert , Republican member of the House of Representatives .
The leadership error at CENTCOM ranges to the top tip of the organisation .
The ten-side report shows detailed consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces .
Although there is no direct indication that government peaks have given under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts suffered pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` During the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before Congress were much more positive than it matches the facts , the report noted .
For example , a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military recovery could begin Mossuls as early as April or May 2015 .
Mossul , second-largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic state .
After months of investigation , it is so clear. , said Mike Pompeo , Republican Congressman from Kansas , in an opinion .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command 's leaders changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
Republicans called the task force into life after playing that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
The report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue .
In addition , further investigation is underway by CENTCOM reports by the Defense Ministry 's general inspector .
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published on Thursday their own findings , which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force 's conclusions .
In 2014 and 2015 , CENTCOM created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services , `` admitted to the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee , a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion .
This process , according to Mr Schiff , delayed the publication of intelligence reports , damaging morality among analysts and gave overly little room for dissent. ``
But Mr Schiff and Democrats said no evidence of an intervention by the White House at the CENTCOM analysts was found in terms of a particular political opinion .
The preliminary results of the Congress 's investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast .
Last August , the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon 's general inspector , which was included after complaints from CENTCOM analysts .
Lt. Cmdr . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon press secretary , admitted in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment on Congress 's reports while the investigation into the inspectorate was still underway .
But he also admitted that 's experts sometimes well have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Department of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. ``
The investigation has repercussions about the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defence ) .
However , the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can leave to the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
The criticism of secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of information from more than 10 years ago , when a CENTCOM analyst , Gregory Hooker , written a paper on how the then-government under George W. Bush contradicted many analysts only a small crew force in Iraq and little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State .
Last year , the team around Mr. Hooker , according to government offices , notes that , contrary to the government 's statements , air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant implications for the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refineries operated to sell oil on the black market .
However , this finding was not published , the Times reported in September .
Centcom 's then commander , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticised by members of the legislature because of his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .

Destination records : who actually buys records ?
Lonely men 's middle-aged records .
Before rushing to the commentary to overturn him under the pseudonym non-selling men 's age with rough insults , this statement is heading from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-discussed resurgence of records is not on a boom in Millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but attributable to midlife nostalgia .
Those who recently bought a plate are all predicted to be aged between 45 and 54 .
In fact , the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
Nor is it hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs 66 per cent ) .
But do YouGov 's results vote ?
If this blog would be a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run amid a busy street in Soho , wearing a modest grey suit before I stand , keep my hands and say something definitely like : 'let 's throw us a closer look at it. ``
So , let us look at it .
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist business .
I would ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and trying to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I do from Sister Ray ( data count : two young women , three men 's middle age ) to the Reckless Records ( data number : eight men 's middle age , a woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the couple of hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
I 'm already appreciating , `` he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
These records , above pictured ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did n't follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
The reason why he owns such a significant number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now capable of buying records that he could n't afford when they appeared and once again buying items he sold when he was young and bust .
'Many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 , things I was probably too young to buy them , `` he says .
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone , adding : 'I do n't smoke and I do n't drink very much .
That 's my last .
WEZ , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes many customers he meets on the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media , people who have heard about the comeback and prompting to buy again their old plates .
Of the talks I have led , people generally relented in 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy again their records , `` he says .
This would explain the boom to supporters of the record revival of a certain age .
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realise that record business offers a soothing community of peers .
According to WEZ , some of the older customers took push to the contactless payment system .
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar records , from objects that recall happy youth reminders .
I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions than some sort of consolation , `` WEZ WEZ .
That 's with me as a collector and I think it 's happening among many people .
It 's an easy way to deal mentally .
We 're like their social workers ! , a staff from a record stack .
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened .
The survey also found that 41 % own a record player they never use , while 7 % of those buying a record do not own a record player .
At this time of the news report I would presumably look very concerned while I leave through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men of middle age ) , has noticed a trophy aspect of the revival .
`` Someone only recently came here recently and said : 'I do n't own a record player , but I 'd like to buy a radiochead record so I can put them into the shelf , '' he says .
This is not a huge percentage , but it definitely happens .
More product , less music .
We have people who say I do n't have a record player ...
These are younger people , not older , who only slowly get in .
Fopp , which devoted the record almost an entire floor , has a bungled audience than I get in .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists who make the photographs , teenage and women of middle age .
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned businesses - Wild Beast 's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz browns from the loudspeakers - it 's good to see such diversity among customers .
None of them look particularly lonely , but nagging mental trauma are hard to determine when you 're standing alongside someone 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been running around in the business for some minutes and considers the variety of the records on sale .
She 's more likely to make a story stroll than a major purchase .
It does n't earn much , so the collection of plates is not a real option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It 's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... `` she drives with a lovely sigh .
I do n't know how I should explain it - it 's really unique .
My last stop is a business , which is believed to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban outfitters .
While I look at the appearance of patting the Jeans-Hottans , I watched a group of young teenagers who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player .
To the left , there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
No one sees them - perhaps because they are just purely decorative , some so top that it 's impossible to grab them .
It 's pure record art .
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more , there is nothing to complain .
It 's no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one who spends most for luxury items such as records .
Even though my investigations showed that the results of YouGov vote , they let them , at least in plate shops in Soho , leave the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record business and online forums .
These people are probably working hard in school or in offices .
They spend their Thursday tomorrow with certainty not with the strolls through plate shops of the Berwick Street and leaves through records while avoiding the startling look of an unruly , 30-year-old 's false presenter who appears over the shoulders of nothing middle-aged men .

Podolski picks up with gala after supercoup
Hakan Süchin is a football legend in Turkey .
In Turkey , an arrest warrant has been enacted against the former football star Hakan Sünt .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
For the first time after the coup trial , an important football game will take place in Turkey .
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski Galatasaray Istanbul around the supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : business as usual .
Even with the imposition of the state of emergency after the July attempt , the government pleaded not to affect everyday lives of ordinary people .
But this is not true for those suspected of addressing the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
It does n't stop before football as well .
Against the former Starkicker Hakan south , the prosecution provided an arrest warrant .
So the meanwhile in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sound to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed by state President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
While the state of emergency first imposed for 90 days until October , this actually has that on the lives of most Turks , but as well as no impact .
The nightly democracy guards on public places across the country have explained Erdogan on Wednesday for .
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan .
Especially fans of the working-club 's Besiktas traditionally do n't count to the president 's friends .
But what the bulk of the Turks unites in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military councils .
In this is where even even the fans agree - no matter whether their for Galatasaray or Besiktas .
At Cup winner Gala , it will particularly arrive at Lukas Podolski .
His sporting value posed the Cologne in the expired season proving : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31-year-old finished his first season as a top scorer of his club .
In the end game against Fenerbahce , he scored the 1-0 victory .
The newspaper 's fanatics cheered him : he was the best in the place .
He has completed the season outstandingly and secured his team to the trophy .
Thanks Poldi found the disappointing season for the record master a conciliatory deal .
After the runner-up K.o . in the Champions League , the lions also divorced in the Europa League early .
In the Super Lig , it just ranked six .
The season was n't good .
The trophy was the only way to win something .
That 's what we did and that 's the most important thing , `` said Podolski .
For champions Besiktas , the match year ran better .
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez , who put the base on the 14th title as a super-Lig goal king .
That 's also the reason that fans continue to hope to return the 31-year-old .
In doing so , the AC Florence under contract had announced only borrowed Gomez after the coup attempt because of the political situation in the country following his EM holiday .
If Mario wants to get to us , he must just say , `` quoted the specialist magazine 's chief chef Fikret Orman .
To do this , though , the striker would have to be ready to renounce at around a third of its annual alert , Orman clearly said : `` his salary at Florence ca n't we pay . ''

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschel is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisation .
Besides , she is social worker on the ground .
Since July , Annika Deuchel is the refugee officer for Urbach .
The social pedagogist supports the administration 's team around Achim Grockenberger .
She sees itself as a contact partner for all players : refugees , working circle refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else .
Regime customers from the working group suggest that volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there , the egg legendary wool milk which has mostly a problem .
That 's how some - less spotted than rather to the variety of desired assignment areas - meant when the administration wanted to tender the place .
Searched an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long-standing experience in the area of social work , just an emerging wool milk sauce .
But administration work is not her central area , means Annika Deuchle .
Above all , it 's about organisation , working with the people on the ground and behind the scenes as well as networking .
The 31-year-old has been involved for about six weeks .
It has a 50-percentage point to three years .
It was high time , says Regine Customer that Annika Deusche supports honorary and full-time players .
There are big and small problems , organisational , human and understanding problems .
Soon , new containers are standing in the Wasen Street
A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognised .
Local authorities are responsible for connecting accommodation .
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented housing rooms .
The cost of construction , rent or renovating these shelters must bear the local authorities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the land office to local authorities and job centres .
Problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his home .
The search has been designing for some time as very difficult .
De facto , the administration does n't find private homes .
So far , it does n't work on private homes , according to Deuschle .
Therefore , charitable apartments need to be enthusiastic as it means beautifully .
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasen Street .
But only with apartments it is not done .
Perspective is the cue , Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a fixed lead , there are internships , training agencies , school places , one-jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up .
`` More places would be good , '' Regine customer reports .
Many work in the bauf or help home companies , do not-for-profit work - and that motivates and very properly , as Annika Deuschle reports .
It hopes work for the community leads to a positive outfield .
This is not an employment therapy .
But activity does n't just think of work .
The day needed a firm structure , say Deuschle and customers .
People would have to develop a sense of belonging .
So it takes offers like sport , contacts with locals and , above all , language courses .
Professional courses are rar .
So here are administration and volunteers here .
It 's central that the refugees feel they were wanted in Germany and welcome .
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem .
They have to explain to the refugees that it will take it and they can bridge the time meaningfully , for example with language courses .
Who eventually developed the feeling that he could n't help in Urbach , should not be allowed to work and be unnecessary , which will never integrate .
The significant majority is motivated .
However , there are problems , though , says customers honestly , people who do nothing at all . `` The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others .
This is all already a mammoth task .
One difficult question : have the two after recent events fear radicalisation , even in a small community like Urbach ?
No , Regine Kunde said quite clearly what some naive likes . `` A restriction could be , but do n't want to exclude them .
However , the aides are already aware .
These incidents were also subject to refugees .
They would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely into disrepute .
They want to show that they have nothing to do with it , `` says Regine customer .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
So primary and volunteers will have to look for activities on the ground and in the region .
They always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach .
Does Germany need a ceiling ?
Clearly answering that question is politics .
Actually , it 's unfair to put them on the ground .
In Urbach , we have n't arrived yet where we would like , `` says Annika Deuschel .
No new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already being charged with integrating the previous people sensibly .
These are currently about 100 people , predominantly young men .
But if people are in distress , you have to help them , both women agree .
The political world situation is so complicated , as there are no easy answers .

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass fleeing
Who does n't adjust and praise Erdogan , sits on packed suitcases , `` says the chairman of the Gülen-New Foundation dialogue and world , Ercan Karakoyun .
The Kurdish community of Germany reckons in the short term with tens of thousands of protections fleeing from Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term , it could even become a few hundred thousand , believes the association chairman Ali Toprak .
Because of the tough approach by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
In the short run I reckon with tens of thousands , medium-term with some hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the Democratic opposition , `` says the Association of Association Ali Toprak of the World of Friday .
Because the government already overcame Kurdish strongholds with penalties months ago , 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey .
After the thwarted coup added secular and opposition ethnic Turks .
Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to suppress in Turkey .
It can not be that a state that includes even refugees produces refugees in its own country , `` said Toprak .
The association complained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in alert cities .
As a result , Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
They are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years , `` said Toprak , who is also CDU member .
The association 's chief called for the federal government to position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters. ``
Also in Germany , a witch hunt takes place against Erdogan critics .
I do n't feel safe in Germany in recent months for the first time .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will look for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition officials .
The fire mark as Gülen supporters destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence .
Who does n't adapt and praise Erdogan , sits on packed suitors , by the way , including the Kemalists and seculars , `` said Ercan Karakoyun , chairman of the Gülen near dialogue and education , the world .
As the newspaper reported , citing figures from the Federal Interior Ministry , the Turks already posed the biggest group of asylum-seekers recognised in Germany because of political persecution .
On the cut-off date June 30 , this were 11,386 people , and therefore just under 29 per cent of all as asylum recognised ( 39,625 ) .
This survey did not find themselves fled to war , poverty or perspective .
Asylum entitlements under the basic law are exclusively political , therefore by government side , individually persecuted .

The depressing meal of the economic crisis in a rich meal
In March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
As a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a fait for sophisticated delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup .
His menu this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato piracy and as a dessert a plum pudding .
It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , `` said Jane Ziegelman .
Her husband Andrew Coe added , `` It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . ''
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coes 's latest book Chop Suey acted from Chinese cuisine in the US , while brick man in her book 's 97 orchard has been told about life in a housing at the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
Her latest collaboration , a decent meal , will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publisher , illustrating the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg 's Sandwich Shop , a small , unnecessary snack at the Flatiron District , which has already been in business since the stock crash in 1929 .
Brick man , 54 , ordered a freshest cherry with olive pieces , while Coe , 57 , turkey with potato purges and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered reporters , this found this fitted the couple for a discussion of the food in the era of the Great Depression .
`` Rich groceries were very popular , '' said Ziegel .
There was peanut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
They were prepared from an ingredient and slightly cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners .
CoE grinsten .
It must have laid in the stomach like lead , `` he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all-y-can-eat buffet .
Teams of women cook for male field workers and it was served freshly baked paste for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War , a Square Meal distinguishes the pathways with which the country declined to be no longer the slate land .
It was a time when food for the Americans was a central , tense theme , `` endorsed Coe , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
Just as tense was the new budget diet : mysterious foods such as bread and casseroles have become basic foods , casserole rolling as a `` wonderful way of recovering food rests , '' noticed brick since cooks could hide unappetitive ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
Meat , which was years at the heart of the American cuisine , became a rarely served luxury .
Strange mixtures have been tried , as a calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
During her research for the book , which includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a court from this era , baked onions with peak butter .
It was n't a popular addition at lunchtime , `` says Coe .
Brick man continues : it was surreal .
Peanut butter and baked onions do n't fit each other .
It was typical for many of the home economic recipes .
As never before or since , budget economists - including Louise Stanley , director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - drove the country 's eating habits of this kind .
By releasing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become budget policymakers and to meet the challenge of turning pamper like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
A Square Meal is a festival of historic delicacies .
In particular , the reports of the government 's response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoover 's lass-mich-cake food stance .
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he dined like the millionaire man of world to which he has become .
He moved continental kitchen like fish with cucumber sauce , `` Coe said .
He in a nearly gilted dining room and wearing a smoking .
He was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife , Eleanor , called him to state an example with his stomach .
As described in the book , the hinters of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt carried out that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington but also one of the most prepared .
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was dismissed once the country came back on its legs .
The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel , as well as how science was applied to food .
The couple announced the book 's eating habits better understood the book 's eating habits - for example , like they could n't throw food .
She had a real fear of wasting food , `` Coe said .
Brick man recalled : 'you actually made people sick .
There was the wind plague incident .
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg , they and Coe produced a dessert which they had been preparing at home : the plum dessert , which President Roosevelt was attached to midday .
It is called Prune Whip , `` said Ziegelman , adding that it was an usual trick to miss a sending name .
There was no beaten cream , just plums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Everyone emerged somewhat reluctantly a spoon in the tough , brown glibbers .
Amazingly , it did n't taste bad .
CoE took three times an afterthought .
Like a Can-Do-Budgeter , he told his wife , `` A couple of hacked walnuts would help . ''

Raiffeisenbank Gmund at Tegernsee requires rich savers in future criminal interest rates - as a second institute in Germany .
Bank chief executive Josef Paul said Thursday : `` it 's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily accounts . ''
The Federal Association of Deutsche Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : ordinary savers would not need to be afraid to pay for their savings criminal penalties .
Camp banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty .
This fee requires Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over £100,000 to giro or daily accounts .
`` The first £100,000 are free . ''
The next 100,000 costs £400 in the year , `` Paul said .
He has been wary of 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could n't recover .
`` They are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent cost , '' the bank 's chief said .
I ca n't hint for every million 4,000 euros. ``
The cost he now continues after the polluter principle is now .
Letting the cash just be in the trespasses of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous : I have experienced four overs , I do n't want to get the fifth of them ! , `` the bank 's board said .
Most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
Few wandered to other banks .
The Co-operative Association Bayern said : the ECB 's extreme monetary policy course causes significant costs at all banks. ``
Carrying it alone is business permanently not possible. ``
Some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account , credit cards or transfers .
With criminal interest rates for deposits of three million euros , the Thuringer People and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with their Skatbank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kemmer , chief executive director of the banking association , said : `` we do n't expect private customers to have to pay coverage of charges for deposits , so the competition in Germany is far too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks . ''
A banker said there 's on the Tegernsee there 's been a clientele that is slightly luxurious from the assets. ``
This can become the problem for a little bank 's problem when they are wary of free money .
The 1911 Co-operative Bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach-Egern , Kreuth and Tegernese .
In the region , familiar actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live .
The Co-operative Association Bayern is currently not known any other banks that charge a replacement for deposits of private clients , `` spokesman seriously said .
The president of the Federal Federation of German People 's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken ( BVR ) , Uwe happiness , had explained at the end of June : `` the threshold , into negatives towards the private client , is very , very high . ''
The competition is hard , and it faces the migration of investors to competition .
Customers in Germany will not like that in the width .

Trade between Russia 's Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Russiness
With the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Levan Dzharyan , trade sales between Moscow and Tehran in the year , grew by 70.9 per cent .
Since international sanctions have been lifted against Iran , interest on the part of Russian companies at stores in the country grew strong , the ambassador told .
Russian companies are taking existing links with Iran , while new firms are ready to access the market .
Of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral collaboration with Iran , said Dzhagaryan .
He noted that trading sales between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 70.9 per cent compared with the same period in 2015 , and $ 856 million .
In particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 per cent to $ 158 million .
The trade recovery has been reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and guns , `` the ambassador said .
Dzhagaryan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
Last year , the Russian overseas representation admitted about 35,000 visas , primarily travel visas , an Iranian citizen .
In addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , affecting the number of tourists in Russia .
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken from last year , `` he said .
At the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
Personally , I can recommend the visit to the cities of Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd , who have received monuments of the old Persian civilisation in a good condition , `` he said .

Traveller Ian Wright scores for a travel guide to his tongue to the dirtiest places of Europe
A British traveller underwent his immune system and citizenship of a serious examination - by leaving some of Europe 's most dirtiest and most energetic places .
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk shadowed his train on a euro ticket , a railing at the Piccadilly Circus , a rink of a Zugtoilette as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system .
Before the divergence of each object , he used a luminometer to show us and what he will enter .
But the experiment , which was filmed under the title : The Lickhik 's Guide to Inner Strength , brought some surprising results to daylight .
The thought of disconnecting the flush of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely repellent , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen ring .
On his trip through Europe , Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about promoting bacterial bacteria as well as about his own health .
Fortunately , nothing left what he dismissed , more than a bad afterthought in the mouth .
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
From public railings to station stations to rinsing toilets , the job put his immune system definitely under a sample
In the film , he told : `` already as a child , I was relatively uncomfortable about what affects my health and I 've had all kinds of things put in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film , he was definitely fair to his reputation .
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
His trial showed a luminome number of more than 4,000 units .
In comparison , the luminometry number is freshly washed hands less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to strip after their luminometers were over 4,000 units while freshly washed hands one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film The Lickies Guide to Inner Strength , which shows the bacterial number in different locations such as the bathroom
In the film , he says : `` this comes the worst of what I 've smelled in a toilet , close . ''
There 's nothing more dirty than that !
I 'm going to leave nothing here because it 's indoors here .
The Lickner 's guide to Inner Streggth was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio .
The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus , which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bacterial bacteria and the immune system .
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` we wanted to provide really something new to consumers .
Something that is fascinating to watch , while at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics .
We led crazy brainstorming through which ended up telling Lass Ian to call .
They claim that interest is going to be a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it 's linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hakala , who led the film 's director , adding : `` let me say it like that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I have depended on him , like the echoed Russian toilet shown in the film .
Of course , there were things where it was easier to get Ian to cover them and others where this was pretty difficult .
I 'm glad we 've taken some of these dirty leaks on film. ``
In one of Valio 's 2015 survey , 84 per cent of all respondents associated milk acid bacteria , particularly with the welfare of stomach and intestine and 58 per cent said they at least occasionally use products that include attached milk acid bacteria .

Still , Volkswagen comes through .
Despite diesel scandals , extradition figures rise worldwide .
But not in all markets runs around .
In the recall action , there 's swirling about a term .
Volkswagen launches behaviour in the deliveries in the second half .
Europe 's largest automaker can continue to provide a plus in the previous year despite the diesel effects thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets .
But in July , the core brand VW weakened in western Europe , putting it back to the total sale , as the company noted in the Dax .
Worldwide , the brand VW sold in July with 449,000 cars 1.8 per cent fewer vehicles than in the previous month .
In Western Europe alone , to China the second most important market , sales were 14 per cent under the previous month .
In Germany 's home market , the deliveries slipped by almost a sixth .
Brand distributor Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
In addition , in some core markets , by changing economic framework conditions , there was a buying retention .
In addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British vote to leave from the EU has also explained a spokeswoman .
In the US , where the exhaust affair escalated first , it also continues to be a minuscule .
Big supporters for VW is the Chinese market .
Overall , the mainly affected household brand of Lower Saxony continues to come by the diesel scandal anyway : after the first seven months , only an extradition minus falls from 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles .
Group sales chief Fred Kappler could continue to provide a sales plug from January to July .
1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust gas .
In Germany alone , VW calls 2.5 million cars to convert into the workshops .
In the wake of conversion , VW reaffirmed that the reconstruction of the cars has no negative effects .
After converting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , carbon emissions or engine performance .
The automaker presents customers after converting a `` guarantee certificate , but do n't speak of a '' guarantee , as opposed to corporate circles on Friday .
The reason is legal fine units .
The focus had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for revamped diesel models .
This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Department of Department last Monday .
Confirmed from the Department of Transport that there was this meeting .
VW has fully fulfilled the conditions of my investigative commission and the KBA. ``
Deviations of these are not accepted , `` said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , according to the ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption , carbon emissions or engine power after conversion , there will be no deterioration and have all type-approved vehicle values unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term 's guarantee but not as it did in corporate circles .
In the vast term 's guarantee , Volkswagen sees the possibility that , for example , customers could come into a workshop for example after conversion - and this could return to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
Even in customer interest , it is important to avoid the fact that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal comes to an uncertainty about possible warranty arrangements , as it does .
That 's why VU does n't use the term 's guarantee .

Rio 2016 : ROBEL Kiros Habt becomes Internet
Not always determine the Olympics or world records the headlines at the Olympics .
This shows the courageous appearance of ROBEL Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
In the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia is so slow that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images .
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the selection was selected .
In the social networks , Habte then became the viral internethit .
Indeed , the 24-year-old finishes with a lag of 48 seconds his forward and finished 59 place of 59 starters .
But it was more of his not exactly sporting figure that moved the attention of international media .
Why the 24-year-old nevertheless participates in the Olympics ?
The Ethiopians got a special starting law by the International Swimming Federation .
This is distributed to make swimming known in under-represented countries .
As most athletes run in Ethopia , Habte just wanted to do something else .
Preparing is all : ROBEL Kiros Habte makes himself ready for the big race .
Quickly , the first nicknames made the round .
Some media described him as a Robel of the Wal .
In terms of a 's welfare belonging , the English tabloid The Sun made with Dad Bod about him funny .
His time , he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds about the 100 meters free , playing no part .
Comparisons with Eric Eel were also drawn .
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney , the run of Eric Moussambani caused media attention .
Memorable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to take off alone in a lead over 100 metres of free style .
Frenetically , Moussambani was fired at the time .
The then 22-year-old learned only eight months before Olympic and had never gone for such a long distance before the competition .

Queensferry Crossing : bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the Norddeck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now associated with Fife .
It 's the first of four closures of the blowers closer to completion around each of the bridge 's three towers .
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 slopes .
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Economy minister Keith Brown stated the construction site today and was one of the first to get to the bridge from the country .
He said : `` this is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queensferry crossings .
We are all witnessing an engineering art from a truly epic measure of this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
Despite the bridge 's massive size and weight , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the adjustment .
Overall , nearly 79 per cent of the total bridge decks in their place and the last section of the deck are getting a concrete concrete for the deck today , meaning that the entire deck is prepared to be raised on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : `` the first closure represents a significant milestone on every bridge project .
During this fantastic project , the closure of forward-looking civil engineering .
After installing the last road section and its compound with the expanding northern turkey , we then had to close the existing gap on the North or land side .
This was reached by pulling the northern feeding bridge 700 millimetres south .
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
Massive as the viaduct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be drawn at a slope of about 3 per cent .
Thorny , as the tolerances to which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters .
Fortunately , everything was very good .

Greenlandai : the oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks are mostly just in winter to surface .
This shark has returned to the sea following an investigation on board the research ship Sanna .
He was born in 1624 and swimmed with good a 1km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland 's shark will only get up to 150 years .
Indeed , the Greenlandhai swim at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he comes on average just 1,220 feet .
Just when it comes down , the five metre long animals are accelerating to satellite 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robber .
However , this long-standing lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science , in any case , of a Greenlandhai , which could be 392 years old .
`` Madness , '' comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for vertebrae .
While the evolution biologist has long been suspected , Greenland sharks will become stone .
Only the evidence was missing .
Greenland 's sharks are hard to watch , after all , they live especially in the ice cream in front of the thinly populated coastlines of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they mostly dive on the surface only in the winter .
Researchers accordingly know about the lifestyle of Greenlandhais .
Her timeless pace measures them when they equipped six animals with a broadcaster before Spitsbergen .
Prey these sharks are still making : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a robbe , another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
Possibly they are chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice seas and search caravers who torture from higher water layers .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues are now investigating 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen picked up fishermen between 2010 and 2013 ahead of Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatches from the depth of the North Atlantic .
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long , while the largest 502 inches .
To determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the sharks with the carbon 14 method .
This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks , which included proteins will no longer be renewed later .
The two smallest sharks had strikingly had a lot of carbon 14 in the lentils .
Her birth should therefore be following the early 1960s , when nuclear attempts made larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
In the country with 220 centimetres of third-seeded animals , the lentils contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from nuclear tests , therefore likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
All the larger Greenland hair , by contrast , had normal carbon 14-foot quantities that emerge through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
Indeed , the carbon clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenhandhandi showed an age of 335 , while the record has been likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimetres .
That Greenlandhai females were only getting offspring when they are longer than four feet , was known .
Now , the researchers were able to assign length an age .
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of gender tire and his age was determined with 156 years , Greenland sharks with the propagation obviously leave at least one and a half centuries .
Even this is likely to be world record for vertebrates at the moment .
That such Methusaleme lives especially in icy waters is n't a coincidence .
Even the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenwall whose bacon on the neck put a 120-year-old harpoint top , was caught before Alaska .
Through low temperatures , frequently , the organism of the animals living there also runs on savings flames .
So they mature later - and ageing slower .
To keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly great .
Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than at a gram elephant .
Another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should be focused on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible , `` explains the evolutionary biologist .
By contrast , a very large animal should invest its resources into a long life .

Bomb Terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Multiple Dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand are in contact with the woman , said the State Department 's spokesman , Thomas Schnell , Friday morning .
She suffered cutting edge and had been treated at the hospital , but this one can already leave .
Her home trip was scheduled for early September .
Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket , as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens , were still unclear for now .
The State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , according to school .
In about 200 kilometers south of the capital , Bangkok , Hua had initially exploded two bombs on Thursday night in a nightclub .
In doing so , according to police , a Thai child was killed and about 20 people have been injured , including the Austrians , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning then again took two explosives , with another person killed , according to the authorities .
A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning .
At the detonation near the popular beach of Patong , a taxi driver was injured after police claims .
In Surat Thani on the country 's southeast coast , another bomb then exploded , killing an urban employee .
The explosives went into the air , according to authorities in a flower before the area of coastal police .
Eventually , detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south west coast , as well as in Chmphom on the southeast coast , called for several injured .
You go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin , it said .
The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting , said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists .
`` We assume that it 's a coordinated attack . ''
It 's too early to comment on possible motives - probably handle , though , around the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
Thai police , on the other hand , said the assassinations were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or with international terrorism .
This is only local sabotage restricted to limited areas and provinces , `` said a spokesman in Bangkok .
Rather , the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta .
Authorities have received intelligence indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days - but they were not informed about the exact date and places .
Still , it 's unclear which group behind the attacks .
Police advised their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and pleasure quarters .
In Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they are usually not against tourists .
In Hua is a palace used for years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
According to the now bomb explosions , the Austrian State Department recommends its homepage , necessarily affording the instructions of Thai security authorities .
High security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla , as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding area .
After clashes between security forces and Muslim population parts , there will be no necessary travel in these provinces .
Increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the constitution prepared by the military junta .
This admits to the military 's great influence in the coming years .
Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , improving economic situation and tourism .
The military union , which had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , keeps itself benefiting the kingdom back to stability and order .
However , the military has also failed to get to grips with the insurgency of Muslim rebels for years .
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
Just over a year ago , in Bangkok , in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
It was the bloodiest attack of the country 's younger history .

Olympic 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught off : because of a positive doping test , weight leader Adrian Zielinski may not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official drug cases .
A caught athlete would have won almost a medal .
Before the seventh competition day , the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000-metre obstacle Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weight leader Adrian Zielinski have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions coming to the time .
At Chen , last Sunday , the Diuretic Hydrolothiadiac was proven to be used as a masked fund for doping substances .
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon .
On Sunday , the 18-year-old had finished fourth place in the final over 100m butterfly , only 0.09 seconds missed them the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen should have participated in the precursors of more than 50m of free-style .
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) the opening of the B and a hearing .
The national association takes the matter very seriously and requires Chen full cooperation in the investigation , quoting Xinhua from a communication : we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict .
For the first time in history , it is no longer the IOC , but the CAS for sanctioning athletes with positive cases .
Also on the night of Rio , the news about the positive test at Danekova leaned through , the 33-year-old went into the offense himself .
I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , `` this was an incredible shock , '' she told Bulgarian TV station BNT .
She was innocent , `` the only statement could be food supplements , '' the athlete explained .
According to the report , the banned substance is to act around the blood doping EPO .
Danekowa has been preliminarily suspended , according to BNT , the B-test is also allowed to fall positively .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticising the athlete .
I do n't understand why the athletes do n't pull the right conclusions , `` he said : we Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been ruled out . ''
So about all the weight leaders from the chronically doping nation do n't participate in Rio .
On Friday , the case was also known to the Adrian Zielinski , the London-based Olympic champion in class to 85 kg like his brother Tomasz three days earlier tested positive on the anabolic steroid nandrolon .
Both deny the intake , but should not be allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
Before launching the athletes , especially the case of Danekova is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
The World Federation IAAF had banned the complete Russian team to an exception because of systematic doping the launch , including runner Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
In swimming sport , the previous offences in China had also provided fierce clashes between the athletes .
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt grabbed the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
Sun Yang pink purple .
When I see the podium over 200 m free set , I want to hand over , `` said Lacourt in French radio .
Sun was also at the heart of a clash with Australian Mack Horton .
I have no time and no respect for doping cheats , `` said this .
Sun was tested positive at the Chinese championships in 2014 , but had to seat only a three-month lock .

B27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
There 's nothing to mean by the speed with which the B 27 is sane .
For those responsible for the construction works , which start at 5.30am in the morning and only end up at about 8pm , there 's allential praise .
They 've done everything pretty zacking , `` told Elvira Tetzlaff of the Jet petrol station .
That 's a super super .
There is no delay either .
The building site could be relocated to the south at the start of the week by the end of October , everything is expected to finish .
It also praises the accommodation of those responsible for construction work , such as when it comes to setting up behind driveways .
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday , and also lifted the locking of the Asperstrasse in Ofterdingen and therefore the connection to Rottenburg again , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
Citizens can now be on both sides from oftendons from the B 27 .
The extraction traffic through the place seems to go back .
Since there was partially significant complaint , `` says the deputy manager Florian King 's responsible deputy management of traffic management .
Residents of Beith Street , Steinschargstrasse , Hafnerstrasse and Weiherrain had been fighting with more traffic noise because many of the cruises were looking for and more familiar to their navi than the signage .
What led to some trucks fractured in residential areas .
Since the speed limits were not complied with , the community increased the measuring vehicle .
There were significant excesses , `` says King , who made himself on the ground about the situation .
There have been two to three per minute .
The fastest was travelling with 77 hour kilometres in the pace 30-zone .
Since the building site has continued , but it has become quiet .
For businessmen at the B 27 , it 's only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburn , the street is now open again .
Business people are not liked to look into the cards .
But that the B-27 remodeling has resulted in revenue growth in them , leaving everyone you ask .
However , some are more and some less affected .
Anyone with the end customer has less to do , so for other firms , the clean-up has barely consequences .
Even at the automaker Maier , Thomas Sulz speaks of a `` maximum slight decline , but also acknowledges that , of course , the running story is missing . ''
The most battered are the locals along the road .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the steakhouse , foremost crown , finds clear words .
This is already an existential threat .
Not only him , but all the restaurants hit it 's hard. ``
There was a lack of customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil .
We have got to be happy about any euro sales .
The revenue loss is quanting on `` well over 50 per cent . ''
The roadblocks have dropped his operation by two years. ``
Half of his employees have had to dismiss .
If I had a company with 4000 staff and half would have been dismissed , politics would have responded differently .
Instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a question from Göhner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the reference to responding that the restaurant will otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation on the B 27 now , they also have to wear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation .
Göhners know from other counties where something like this has been handled more generously .
In all complaints , Göhner is sure to continue his restaurant .
After all , family operations have been located here since 1715 , pointing to the long history .
That other regulars now look less frequent because of the complicated traffic management can understand .
If you ca n't hear it , it 's beautiful even elsewhere .
The fact that his regular climbers come back after the end of the remedial work , Göhner has no doubts .
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , Göhner holds the impact of the B7 construction work on its clients for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant history in its longstanding story .
Six months of construction work , this is already brutal .

Other overtaken athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio medals .
The issue of doping determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics .
Russian swimmer Juliya Jefifowa , who had been charged with their starting law just before the Games , was mercilessly peaceful at her start ( 100 metres of chest ) .
It offered a wrinkly scene : with an established smile , she was still prouded into the hall and provoked with her appearance .
When they were not going to get gold , the audience broke into a jubilant storm .
But there are still numerous other athletes who despite doping past go to the start at the Rio Olympics .
Here 's an overview :
Justin Gatlin ( 100 , 200 , 4x1400-staffer / USA ) : the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics .
He was already closed twice because of doping ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
Since his ban , the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion runs even faster than before , he is over 100m in 9.80 seconds , the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challenger from Usain Bolt .
Shelly Fraser-Pryce ( 100 , 4x100-Staffel / Jamaika ) : the two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to serve a six-month lock in 2010 after her taking off the painkiller Oxycodon was proven .

LaShawn Merritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x400-m-season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400m , was positively tested in 2010 and blocked 21 months .
A means of penis enlargement was responsible , Merritt pleaded .
This year , the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m of the world 's fastest man .
Iwan Tichon ( Hammers , Belarussia ) : probably hardly an athlete have been renounced so many medals afterwards .
So Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was detected testosterone-doping .
The now 40-year-old also had to issue Olympic silver in 2004 because of testosterone abuse in 2006 .
The also acknowledged bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games received CAS because of a ruling by the International Sports Court .
At 80.04 m , it 's ranked two of the world 's rankings .

The US wins fourth match in the women 's field hockey , a showdown with Britain standing before
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women 's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0 .
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but Bam ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
I have no idea ... she said .
I 'm not among the people who retain their goals in memory .
However , they know the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British in the first place that remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals , the game will decide which of the two will gain the first and second place each within their group of six teams .
The first-place will go for the strong Dutch slightly longer , leading the other group .
Whatever the game on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising swirling through their success stories , four years after they landed at the past London Games on the last of 12 places .
BAM was part of this team .
She grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years of a hockey in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the US , the youngest in the team 's history .
She missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cadre .
Then came the year in 2012 , in which for her and her team , everything went wrong .
In the following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , trainer of the national team and things began to turn to better .
A culture change , a mental change and a physical change , said Bam .
We did n't have the workload in London that we have now .
We can have the rudder completely around .
On Thursday night , Bam opened the torrent in the first half of the game with a backhand from close range .
India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team showed surprising and kept the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands .
They fell a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then dropped into the middle and lups the ball into the gate around the Americans creating a 2-0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the US , Jackie Briggs , who has each had to book a goal in each of the previous games each .
She has a run .
Just like Bam .
We are in a good position , `` said Parnham , but well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .

Buyers in Primark outraged about women who tried underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers did n't know where they should look when a woman pulled her clothes amid a primark to try underwear .
To worsen the situation , she mustered how she looked at it , pulled her and put her back into the shelf .
They continued and tried four pairs of underwear in a business in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkstone .
The Primark business at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone , in which the woman tried underwear before she put them back into the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , she pulled herself again and left the business without buying something. ``
She said : `` people could n't believe what they saw . ''
In the middle of the sales surface , she took a pair of underwear out of the outage , pulling her own tights and pants and tried her .
She did n't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - they just stood there , cheeky like Oskar. ``
Everyone starred when they pulled the underwear again , which they obviously did n't like them as they put them back into the shelf. ``
She repeated the same thing with three other underwear before finally deciding that her nothing liked herself , attracted and rushed out .
She did n't disturb it that they watched someone - or think about the person who would buy the underwear in circumstances they had tried. ``
Mrs Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : 'how disgusting to think that someone would take underwear with home that has another person and who were n't washed. ``
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added : 'how I got to get the staff trying to pull the garments out of sale after they went - which is just as good .
I 'd hate it to go home with a new couple 's underwear and figure out that another woman has handed her and returned and they were n't washed .
A spokesman for Primark said : `` Primark is aware of the incident , which occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folkstone . ''
Any products coming into question were drawn from the sale .

Adblock Plus , Facebook in the cat and mouse game regarding advertising block
For companies earning money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circumvent advertising blocking , a cat and mouse play equals .
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocking on its desktop site , Adblock Plus published a blog place in which it told users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertisers to discover it displaying the detection of which part of the side is advertising .
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes .
In a blog post , the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that 's written this kind of battle between the displaying Open Source Community and the circumstances have already been underway since the invention of advertising blockers is underway , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's largest business for social media has left in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry .
Worldwide , according to a study last year of Pagefair and Adobe , use about 200 million people display blockers ; nearly four times as much in 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook over their mobile terminals , mobile advertising makes 84 per cent of advertising revenues Facebooks .
The company has on display blockers on desktop PCs , as mobile advertisers have no effect on Facebook 's mobile app for the social network and Instagram , a spokesman told me .
Advertising on desktop PCs makes an enough large proportion of revenues so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a move as worthwhile .
On Tuesday , Facebook told that it would update its ad preferential tool to have more control over people on them on targeted advertising .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that Adblock 's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
For the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , `` a spokesman told Facebook in an email communication .
Advertisers are a blunt resource , which is why we instead focused on development tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people 's hands .

Scotted Callum Skinner stormed home when Britons scored gold for cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner rasted last night in the men 's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that had his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had embraced the boy ... the boy made the legend proudly when he stormed home to introduce a victory from the favorites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while the fifth of six Olympic medals picked up .
They repeated the trick after picking up only a modest sixth place in March at the rail championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff .
They did so in time for a hind .
Hoys retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the Scot , which has now unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny - who win with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Zealander won in the first round .
And the British trio won the duel with gold .
Hindes were just back after his round , but Kenny brought the team to the front and skinner held it .
A strategy change made much of the transformation , where Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it and allow Kenny and especially skinners to keep the pace .
Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped skinner , Kenny and Hindes when these rose to the podium .
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said : `` it 's a flattering comparison . ''
I 'm just here to do my best and make me a name .
We set up an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions .
It was just incredible .
There is no better way to win this .
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys , Hindes admitted that after a weak start , he was intentionally on the track .
He later pulled this statement back and there was no appeal from England 's rivals .
In such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem .
Hindes said : it feels like the whole GB flags in the stands like London. ``
We have come together as a team in the last three months .
We have come so badly at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
This is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
If that 's a barometer of our progress in the last five months that expects successful five days at the Velodrom .
With the form Kennys is in the area of the possibility that he reiterates Hoy 's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger Hoy , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day there were also Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the one of Hoy equals .
Kenny is taking part next in the sprint , who will begin today and go over three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said : 'I only enjoy this for the moment .
The team event is always best .
You can win it with his colleagues .
It feels something lonely to win alone .
Hindes said : when he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to Knight. ``
It was the only medal contest of the day but there was further good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race .
They arrived at 3 : 51,942 at the target .
The world record , which won gold in 2012 , was 3 : 51.659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) takes place today on the second day of the competition , where Wiggins will certainly be in focus .
He had argued with representatives before the qualification yesterday when him calling for officials to measure his body size .
In the relevant women 's contest , which continues and finished tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibal of Milngavie in World record time in 4 : 13,260 .
The GB team leaves its strong rail team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympic Games and pick up a char of medals .
After a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were downplayed .
It played dramas in the background , according to the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations as well as retiring sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
However , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom , it looks quite afterwards than the now legendary reputation of GBs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .

Condoms with Chilipud , fireworks promote Tanzania 's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuders .
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation , which had years ago , has intensified its promotion together with U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-legged method to protect their homes and crops without violating animals .
Previously , many spears have used to defend itself .
Friday is World War 's Day , which is devoted to animal welfare .
Since then we have developed that toolkit , we were able to watch a change in their attitude within these communities , with them much more confident that they can hold the elephants from their fields without hurting the elephants , `` the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell expressed in a note .
The first two steps include the illumination of the elephant with a torch and the bubble into a horn .
If he 's not deterred , a so-called chili cloud will be thrown .
Chilipuder mixed with it together with a fire body into a condom whose end is being turned up to the ignition cord .
When it is lit , the condom is bursting with a bang and spraying fine dust on chiluders into the air .
A touch quite usually already out to chase the elephants .
One last possibility represents a campaigner who shoots a gold fire plant into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany 's rasers need to adjust to the next generation speed knife : in different federal economies , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new lightning devices are being tested to effectively transfer paces .
The futuristically acting enforcement trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be deployed to accident points , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by police .
For example , at highway construction construction or sanitary bridges with temporary pace , there is often no needed infrastructure to provide there with a stationary speed limit for complying with the speed limit .
A permanent mobile build-up , however , can be too dangerous or elaborate .
The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient : his battery at uninterrupted measurement five days , the case data is transmitted over a modem .
With laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be captured over several marks .
Variable speed limits as well as passing bans after time , line and vehicle class can also be monitored .
In the high-profile condition you can move to supporters , according to manufacturers with each car with supporters .
For it to be not simply clouded , he is lowered in measurement operation , so the wheels in the armored and by the way also disappear .
In addition , a built-in alarm is expected to protect the flash of vandalism .
Since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic in different federal states and is now also used .
Foreign authorities are also flashing off with the new technology : recently France has down 100 pieces , according to an order of 150 pieces last year .

Opposite a Lidl , who is also to be demolished soon , is already being built : by 2017 , here is scheduled to create a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
Articles about this 's trendy district , as the responsible property company calls Friedrichshain , are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars .
Reason is the house with the number 94 once it was occupied , now residents have lease contracts , but on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and will be used for events .
Especially the Berlin inside senator Henkel had spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a tough action by police against the project , calling the area as a no-go zone for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
After the rooms on the ground floor on June 22 were cleared with 300 police officers , police were patrolling three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground , blocking parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
Meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the spaces .
On July 13 , a Berlin administrative court decided that the eviction was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers drew off under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents .
On this summer afternoon , the road works peacefully : parents are walking with children , people sitting on the pavement ahead of the houses in the sun , others are entertaining late .
In the immediate nearness of the house projects , a primary school and kindergarten .
Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in the Kief since 1999 , and Jana * , who here draws three children , are mainly generated by the police presence .
With residents of house projects , they share concern about rising rents and gentrification .
It does n't sound like a kin , who wanted majority police protection from vandaling left .
The ditch , which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between home staff and their neighbours , does n't exist so apparently .
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class quarter , which also has a low average income and high risk of poverty today .
Also household occupations and the residential residential projects have long been part of the Kiez : in 1990 , numerous homes were occupied in the former DDR , including nearly the entire Mainz Street completely near the Rigaer .
While the mainzers had been cleared under large police bid in a downtrodden street battle , many of the projects in the Rigae were legalized and will still be inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago today .
At the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electorates from all over the world in recent years : with them , residents are now sharing residents from DDR times and former householders their kies .
This is also noticeable in rents that have risen by nearly 60 per cent since 2009 .
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : you acknowledge them on dropped slices or freshly cancerous facades thrown with colour bags .
No other road was mentioned this year along with the words of left-autonomous violence .
One reason that not all neighbors look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : offences such as body injury are aimed at statistics almost exclusively against police .
Most of the offences make property damage , which tends to meet new buildings and freshly renovated homes .
For Kerstin newbies , who have been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , ca n't be a speech from uncertainty .
As for violence , she is appeasing : people in the 94 are their neighbours who were n't determined to have been .
Even the famous burning cars are no longer admitting it directly in the Rigarter before .
For the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : 'here you help each other , live together on the street and get more of each other than else. ``
Newbreekers are deliberately pulled into the Riga street - and stayed .
That 's why it was also so important for residents to get their road back : from the police , politics and the media , who all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the neighborhood in July .
But in the eyes of residents such as newbreeders , the road will continue to take them away : through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that oust the old residents .
These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well bettered , `` she says .
Violence and destruction can not accept absolutely. ``
But what are you supposed to do when one never listens to anyone ?
It sets frustration on all sides , including with police and residents .
For travelers who are annoying about colour bombs , Kerstin newbreeders have little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the kiez .
Anyone herself should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a pub quarter , can complain badly about noise there .
All of the people imagined with front-runners have been asked not to be named with their right name

Donald Trump concedes UNK huge problems in campaigning
The leadership of U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to lose their majority .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republican strike Utah .
A rare moment where the normally large-scale and confident multimillionaire expressed anything like concerns about how correspondents reported .
Having thrown 16 rivals within their own Republican camp , the doubts are now growing on his success in the battle for the White House .
We have huge problems in Utah , `` said Trump in front of evangelical Christians , which he called for support in key federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
The fault was false reports of his candidacy , he took his well-known media place again .
Republican strongholds
Utah is usually a secure bank for Republicans .
A poll from Surveyusa from June said Trump and his competitor from Democrats , Hillary Clinton , were the same .
Other institutes see Trump forward , but not with the distance common for Republican candidates in the state .
As endangered , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
In an interview by the station 's CNBC , Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the rise of Clinton 's again : 'as much as I have done so far .
And afterwards : this will be either successful , or I 'll make a very beautiful , long holiday. ``
He does nothing else to tell the truth .
If it does n't enough for him for reasons of political correctness , that 's fine , Trump said .
Then I return to a very good lifestyle .
According to press reports , Trump 's party is to have threatened to remove money to support his campaign , should he not be able to present better poll results .
Instead of wanting to strengthen the Republicans ' candidates for Congress .

Berlin / heavy : poll before country elections : SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states , Mecklenburg ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) are characterized by significant losses for the government parties and CDU .
This resulted in representative polls of the opinion institute INSA for the picture newspaper ( Friday ) .
While the red-black government coalition could continue to govern in the north , this is not possible after the poll results in Berlin .
In both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to ask the leader .
In Mecklenburg , the SPD crashed 35.6 per cent five years ago to 24 per cent .
The party would only be just before the CDU , which could come back to 23 per cent .
Third place is controversial between the left and the AfD .
The left would come to 19 per cent ( previously 18.4 per cent ) , which AfD would be represented with 19 per cent for the first time in the country 's Day .
The Greens resume despite slight losses with 6 per cent ( earlier 8.7 per cent ) again in the Schweiner Land State .
NPD and FDP would n't represent 3 per cent in the county each .
According to Berlin 's deputy selection , the survey would just 23 per cent ( 2011 : 28.3 per cent ) .
The CDU just reached 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent .
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.6 per cent ) , but before the left with 15 per cent ( previously 11.7 per cent ) .
The AfD would be represented with 14 per cent for the first time in the House of Deputies .
With 5 per cent , the FDP could hope of returning the pirates , by contrast to 2011 missing the entrance .

Better traffic flow on motorway tracker
It 's regularly on the bypass road - here 's a picture of November .
But that is meant to change : the regulatory lane is to be extended .
This is good news for all car drivers who are in careers on the environment road every evening in the traffic jam when they drive over the highway - ( 43 ) .
The national operation of street construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the downhill Weseler Street the legal track at 700 metres .
Motorists then can thrive directly from Hammer Street on the right .
The big advantage : traffic shares early on , improving the total ­ expiration on the much-driven section of the Bundestrasse 51 .
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district 's representation of Münster-West .
The carriageway on the feet nervously needs motorists especially between 17 and 7 p.m .
Working days range from the back to the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond .
Reason is the needle turn on the B 51 just before the downhill Weseler Street .
From here , traffic is only steered over the highway bridge .
The second track had to be rebuilt before three-quarter years ago .
The reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge no longer owns the required vigour to include , especially , heavy traffic traffic dual .
How long this bottleneck and the related workable congestion will last , the relevant national operation can not say .
However , with years to come , because the bridge has an official remaining time between now and 2034 .
For the extension of the legal backlog , the country 's operation deliberately selected the traffic weaker time in school holidays because of disabilities .
Traffic will be passed at the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .

Seriously injured - man stands out on his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured .
As the police said yesterday , the 50-year-old had got the key to the home to pick up his personal things .
Instead , the alcoholised perpetrators cut the clothing of his ex-girlfriend .
When these came to the apartment , he stabbed her twice .
The 44-year-old was injured in his hand and body .
Police were able to arrest the perpetrator .
While the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend , he called his mother .
This alerted its sister then .
Together with her life companion , the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother .
But she could n't move him to leave the home .
That 's why she went out of the house with her life companion .
On the road , they met the man 's ex-life person .
When the two women entered the home again , the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and grabbed his ex-girlfriend .

'A generation protest in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters who call for political changes in Ethiopia encountered violent resistance to the government .
Witnesses say that time protesters were killed during clashes with police in firing changes .
Is Ethiopia straight together ?
Over the past decade , it was one of Africa 's most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy .
But in recent months , protests against the government have been the country and expanded into increasing numbers of areas .
Last week stormed thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
The government 's response was ruthless , according to human rights organisations .
Witnesses said policemen shot and killed on unarmed protesters .
Circulating videos about the protests , which are presumably from the last or the beginning of this year , show security personnel beat young people with sticks while these were forced to make a handset against a wall .
The head of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now requiring an incoming investigation .
It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult , `` said Rashid Abdi , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorist riding over the region , especially in Somalia , only a few countries in Africa , if anything , get so much Western help .
Ethiopie 's economy expanded at the considerable pace .
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commute train in the capital Addis Ababa .
The streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissidents effectively silenced .
Many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the expansions of the desert .
But that could change .
If you suppress people and these do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia .
All of the youth protests .
A generation protests .
There are numerous complaints covering everything from ground use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the opposition 's last seat and now control 100 per cent of parliament .
At the same time , tensions rise along the border with Eritrea ; a fight around this trapping , controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogadine 's National Liberation Front , which has been more or less forced in recent years , exploit turbulence and could arm again .
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness were now exploding after years of getting in front of the surface under the surface .
The first seems harmless : smartphones .
It is only in recent years that very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have been increasingly frequent and improved internet services .
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which they do regularly , particularly in protests , many people can still communicate over internet proxies that hide where they stop .
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two biggest ethnicities in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since eons , the Amharas , who are mostly Christian highlights , have been prospering in politics and the economy while exploiting the oromos , many of which are Muslims and living in flat areas .
But that 's also changing straight .
We are in the process of coordinating under a screen , `` said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of the Oromos .
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the intelligence agencies , in trade and politics .
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was until his death at a non-publicised disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia 's prime minister .
He was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners .
Analysts say he was particularly savvy in it to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special envoy to edit opponents and make them unharmed .
`` The current regime is missing from this fundamental skill , '' said Mr Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopie 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegs , was selected for relatively obscuring reasons to take the position of Mr Meles .
Unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services .
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005 , after thousands protested against elections , which , according to data from analysts , apparently botched and subsequently stolen from the government .
During the following raids , many protesters have been killed , even if it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest went over relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuting plant , as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty .
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government 's internal miscarriage .
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month , protesters in Gondar , an amharic city , of Tigray 's business and the hatred towards the Tigray will be increasingly common in social media .
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position .
The American government used Ethiopia as the base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia , even though they recently told them that it closed this base .
While the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
This , said Mr Abdi , is a very thin gratitude .

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
The 27-year-old defeated Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided final his compatriot and title defender Zhang Jike 4 : 0 ( 12,5,4,4 ) .
As a result , the World Ranking First picked up the Golden Grand Slam with successes at World Cup , World Tour final tournament and just Olympia .
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani .
The two Chinese have made it as expected into the final match and made the title among each other .
As a result , it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick up the individual title in the sign of the five rings .
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic treck was the former SVS legioner Ryu Seung-min from South Korea .
Ma and Zhang were leaving themselves on the plate alone , between the sentences and time-outs did not have any coaches at them .
They had withdrawn to the grandstand , leaving their protesters in the fair competition alone .
'The matches to here I played for my country .
In the final I play for me , `` had Zhang consistently said .
After the party posed gold and silver medal winners with the China flag .
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral .
Ma had really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set .
Afterwards , he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang from just a total of 13 points .
By the superiority of Ma 's developed , not the expected stirring match .
But nonetheless , were sufficiently breathtaking ball changes .
Mizutani won the game by bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4 : 1 .
The Belarussian had a rib injury in his quarterfinals against German champion Dimitry Ovtcharov , which was then in medical treatment , had to content herself with sheet metal .
By the way , Sweden 's Jan-Ove Waldner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jörgen Persson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similarly high table tennis age .

Woman in presumable suicide on Switzerland 's highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night .
Police witnesses witnesses after a woman was overtaken in the early hours of Thursday at a presumable suicide of several vehicles on an exercise .
The incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the Canton Vaud shortly after midnight .
A woman put himself in the dark in an act of desperation on the streets and were hit by several cars , police said in Vaud .
It 's obvious that a Swiss age of 49 , who was overtaken by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
She died on the ground .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , police said , calling on them as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
An investigation was opened , which is a logical step in such a situation , Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
Was a collision preventive ?
That 's something the prosecutor must decide , `` said Hofstetter .
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held to responsibility .
In each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that motorists will not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it did in the newspaper .
Last year a policeman of negligence killing was acquitted after she had overrun and killed a man who was laid on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014 .
The 22-year-old victim had drink and has become unconscious on the street , the court heard .
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went to a justified manner and that a man 's presence on the street was a `` completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation , the judge said .
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 .

Two of the occupants suffered serious injuries , the police said .
The 66-year-old driver of the buses of a travel company from Eisenach had to evacuate to a conflicted ladder , which is partly on the opposition track .
The bus came to the right off the road and slipped into a ditch , as a spokeswoman of police Aurich / Wittmund reported .
Because of the location of the bus , the people could n't leave the bus independently , `` she said .

Six ambulances and an emergency car came to the accident on Land Street 2 .
The uninjured travellers were brought back from a scheduled bus to the Crumbian district of Pewsum .
There , they should wait for a substitute bus of travel companies .
Investigators urged the trucker and possible witnesses to report to police .

Steel - Lightness for Deutsche Steel Industry
The crisis-backed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared an extra cost of millions .
Financial burdens , which the industry threatened from energy support , are off the table .
It remains in liberation from the renewable energy surcharge at the inventories for so-called equipment production in the German steel industry , said Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the West General Newspaper ( WAZ , Friday edition ) .
I 'm really happy that we could finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations. ``
The European Commission , therefore , initially had planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use gases from the block to power generation for its own consumption .
The steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year , according to the German industry association .
Gabriel told the WAZ there is now a principle agreement with the EU commission after talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks , falling an EEG-pay of 20 per cent .
But these are not going to be raised in the steel industry , too .
The IG Metal welcomed Germany 's agreement with the EU commission on standard production .
As a result , the status quo of the previous settlement will be largely enshrined .
Particular importance has Gabriel 's successful efforts for the steel industry .
In terms of our campaign 's stole , the future is this is the first step. ``
Others must follow .
Even in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are weighing , `` explained IG chief executive Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity since the 2008 financial crisis , and a significant price pressure .
Last year the situation continued , when the world 's largest producer country threw China on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel corporations price dumping .
Throughout this spring , the situation has relaxed .
For one , imposed import tariffs on import steel effect , to the other , the economic prospects in China have brightened up .
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
German industry industry Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday .
Most recently , prices were more likely to have stagnated .
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost cutting .
ThyssenKrupp latest wanted not to exclude closures of individual works .
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry in late 2015 .
In July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steelmakers remain cautious .
They produced with 3.4 million tonnes well six per cent fewer crude than in the previous month , as the Business Association told Steel on Friday .
After a short increase in May , the manufactured crowd now went back the second month in a row .
Since the beginning of the year , production is up two per cent below the previous year .
The association expects increased emissions in the coming months thanks to improved orders .

Offerings for children and families in theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in planning .
The project 's intercultural journey continues .
Given the increased refugee figures , the club reckons with many classes that want to get involved .

It is constantly being screwed up in the name of combating terrorism .
After the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package .
But what has a toleration status to do with terror ?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation .
All of his proposals were politically reasonable to the Coalition Partner , says the Federal Minister on the idea of his new security package .
They do n't overcome anyone .
Other , further points would be discussed inside the parties initially .
I 'm also participating in that .
As an interior minister , however , he was located in results and on a 'achievable consensus within the coalition .
De Maizière has passed a little time after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
The falls for this , though , are all the more extensive .
Some is already known , announced : that a new security agency is to take care of the crackdown encrypted communications is not new .
Nor does Germany have to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law .
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities comes just as not surprisingly .
Partly , de Maizière launches a second run for suggestions that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and punish jihadists with double citizenship off the German passport .
This will be difficult points for the SPD , admits to the CDU man .
He does n't consider this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that does n't have any chances at the coalition partner anyway .
A few new ideas presented de Maizière as well .
They have it partly in themselves : it plans to speed up quick procedures for deportation and more opportunities to determine people before deportation .
Refugees targeted in the country are expected to check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review .
In tolerations for rejected asylum seekers , he wants some even worse than previously - such as those who commit offences or throw away their papers to cover up their identity .
Some of this is political and legally delicate .
Some are also still impossible and leaves questions open .
And on some points - during inequality of tolerated for example - the question poses : what actually does this have to do with security and terror ?
Yes , says de Maizière is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
But it does n't conclude , yes , that the assassins of Ansbach and Werzburg were refugees .
Moreover , given the high refugee figures , many people were concerned about security .
And things that people deeply employed now also did n't exclude even in campaign time .
Internal security is enormous in the focus .
Only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Wirzburg and Ansbach .
The uncertainty is great .
And yes , there are campaigning .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
In the past few days , it was high between the two parties .
Just a garden dispute over the federal police , then about a security ideas collection of some Union interior ministers , in which the residents `` leaders also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship .
De Maizière is also struggling here to be conciliatory tones .
From a departure from double passport , he did n't have anything .
We pacified the discussion in Germany .
Remodeling them is not meaningful .
And in a burka ban , he had constitutional concerns .
Whether its own package on all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually reasonable for the coalition partner , has yet to show .
There is something in it what could provide controversy .
But the SPD is also currently trying to profit on the issue of internal security .
Leader Sigmar Gabriel only signals cautious discussion readiness and says : `` the SPD is prepared to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . ''

Postal services rise in trading with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
The interest of other companies at the danger is apparently great .
The post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetStreet scooters as well .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : the First Smartphone
Email and Internet in timeline : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communicator on the market .
The sequels dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
It was thicker and bigger , therefore it was n't good in hand either .
On the contrary , it was pretty knocking .
The built-in memory was initially eight Megabyte , which would be ranging for roughly two selfies with high resolution today .
An iPhone is now being delivered with at least 16 gigabytes .
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
For a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the internet age 's stone .
However , 20 years ago , the Communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at Cebit 's Cebit in Hanover as an office in western pocket format .
In fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , including by Fax , the Communicator .
Even access to websites was possible by HTML browsers , although agonisingly slowly .
A pocket calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
Pretty proud was the price : 2700 D-Mark , that is , about 1400 euros .
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was at 392 euros in 2015 .
No one could see in August 1996 that the communicator would become the start of the smartphone era .
Since then , it has been different .
The smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
The Finns ' mobile phone savings experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and wound up .
The market dominates providers today , which came all much later than Nokia .
Always and everywhere online , that 's today for very many people everyday .
In 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .

Donald Trump explains his allegation Obama had founded ISIS was sarcasm .
Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the latest controversy on Friday that surrounded his campaign by saying his multiple repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not be serious about the founders of the terrorist group of Islamic State .
This clarification accused new questions about the Republican 's communications skills , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public .
It also brings to his fellow campaigners who are seeking to take him into protection during an eventful phase into the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could n't mean at all .
After making the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday night , Mr. Trump returned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did n't intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
But in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic .
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day , where Mr Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation was perfectly serious .
When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted Mr. Trump to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know .
The latest storm of the criticism praises Mr Trump , while attempting to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling polls on the economic situation .
Mr Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried to return back to this issue .
Speaking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defence .
In late July , he pulled strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but explained he later said , of course , I said that sarcastically. ``
This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the language boundaries in politics and then return back to need .
I think it 's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then , if appropriate , clarifying depending on how the reaction is out , `` said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates .
But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways .
Rather than defying the tone for presidential elections , Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corroborative tone as his poll ratings have continued to decline .
A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a great advantage in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida .
While Mr Trump generally attempts not to apologise for his provocative remarks , he frequently accused his critics of distorting his statements or wrongly understanding his humor .
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's joke brought his loyal compassion into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how provocatively his statements may be .
Rudolph P. Giuliani , former mayor of New York and one of Trump 's most prominent advocates , gave great trouble to defend the candidate in a CNN interview Thursday today .
I think what he says is legitimate , political comments , Mr Giuliani said , so he was interviewed to the accuracy of Mr. Trump 's statements whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
It is true in this sense that before Obama , ISIS , was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called them backbenchers , completely wrong and therefore happened because he dropped the troops from Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed ISIS to spread by subjecting it to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East .
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them off on each of his words and being biased against him .
He derided the `` poor , poor television experts who try to understand him and said , '' you ca n't ! . ``
Some of the Democrats scored about Mr Trump 's apology as just another evidence that he was inappropriate for the president .

NASA climate model : Venus was once inhabitable
Venus was probably once inhabited by a new NASA climate model , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms resembling those of climate researchers .
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have once eating conditions with their hot , waterless surface and carbon atmosphere .
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earthy atmosphere and still turned slowly .
The model also lit the topography of early Venus .
The planet probably dismissed more dry areas than de earth , but had once enough water and geographic variability to host lives and protected fast evaporation .
Early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 per cent matter .
In the GISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exposes their daily side of the sun almost two months , `` said Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio in a news release .
This warms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which looks like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun warmth .
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
The model brought a story of Venus that resembles the evolution , which was previously suspected by planetary researchers .
Although she was once presumably habitable , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years - exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light .
Their oceans evaporated and their water steam was burned away from the ultraviolet light .
When their hydrogen emerged , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse -- the Venus , which as we know them today .
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Models in the Geophysical Research Letters .

Amid the rage of the Olympics , the ten of the trampoline
Wherever you are , how late it is , it 's the Olympics .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistent and inevitable , a rampant staff run between competition and pursuit .
It 's as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff , which is fed by the breakfast protection to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete .
You ca n't turn on the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour 's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there is still Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who is there for the first time at the Olympics and a woman 's swarm with greens , could have been well under those known names being sent to Prime Time , built through sponsors and feel-good TV advertising when he would be a swimmer , turner or even fox .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , struggles in the Olympic trampoline around .
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equal .
Further away from the centre , partly in the shadows , the sports that are not generally recognised are air pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwond .
We will always have the breast swim and may be long .
But if I likely make modest arguments for my certain darling , let me draw attention to the trampoline 's discreet charm .
Although trampoline jumping has already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , it has been so sparsely perceived the last 16 years that many of them , I had interviewed , did n't know it was any Olympic sport .
That could also be regional ignorance .
Although the US sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and by 2012 an athlete that made it to the final round .
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider low , in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unexplained ear for a close school than the one for the Olympics .
At this point I should admit that I 'm not an expert but only an earthquake enthusiast .
It has humorous potential - the cartoonage of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of the turn and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish el trampoline , which means as much as a springboard .
Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shooting almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a range of falling movements ( turning , Hechten and Saltos ) before landing on the feet .
They are being assessed , according to official Olympic programme after running , difficulty and flight flight .
Two-term athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will join each other in Rio .
The most common Olympic vector is straight .
Medallists need to go further in their pursuit of gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down in the playground .
They do n't just chase the finish line or the starting wall , but in television transmission also another goal : the world or the Olympics .
The targeted pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatical - and it 's enough to even touch a viewer to tears .
But it 's also what I recognise myself at the viewing of these games as something tiring .
This offers the trampoline a breathing space .
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up .
A forward movement is not the goal .
He or she collapses , apparently heavily like an astronaut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back up again .
Even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise , there 's no hectic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dreamy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It 's so Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
Women 's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2 p.m .
Amid the Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one which is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult .
If the awareness increase can only be achieved by the angst and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner proposed recently , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his struggling , new fancy community .

Who is building Braunschwing 's favourable homes ?
The SPD and Greens think : investors are to be much more duty in the future .
How do you respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 favorable homes in the next few years ?
The SPD proposes a 's concept of action to the next council meeting .
But dispute is programmed .
First and foremost about the question : who is to actually build the favourable homes ?
So far , a settlement is missing .
SPD chairman Christoph Bratmann thinks : `` we agree with the Greens : who wants to build urban areas in the future 20 per cent of all apartments as social housing . ''
However , the favourable apartments can also emerge in the stock .
However , the big point in City Hall is , according to Bratmann : how to go around with investors who want to build on private areas ? .
We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas , but as much as 20 per cent of homes as social housing. ``
A new urban housing support program , which will cost millions and has yet to be funded , is expected to provide incentives .
The problem , according to Bratman : `` there 's no agreement between the groups at the moment . ''
The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible .
The left still wants tough conditions for investors .
Regardless , according to Bratmann , a tightening of the situation on the housing market .
If the action concept is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in construction management .
More staff is needed .
It 's unclear whether we will get the professionals .
But the program is still not altogether : because the around 1260 new homes should be built anyway .
But how do you equal the loss of another 1300 favorable homes whose promotion will expire over the next few years ?
It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
To prevent this , according to planning spokesman Nicole Palm , expiring ties should be bought from the city .
Additionally , thought would have to be thought to pick up housing back into price returns .
This is possible in the Western City .
On one blow , the problem could be solved .
Because in the West Council , the year-end deadline runs out .
Around 1800 homes could pick up there back into the price of favourable homes .
Just : that 's wanting the owners , the housing companies do n't .
Because the number of social housing in the West City is being raised drastically again , removed from the target of so-called mixing .
A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few city districts is expected to no longer exist .
The Greens expect there will still be movement in the discussion .
Group chairman Holger Herlitschken thinks : for a broad majority , the CDU needs to be in the boot .
While this was focused on more construction places for detached houses .
But what does n't mean that a compromise can not yet be found .

Assistant doctors would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy hunt 's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted on an election declined to do it .
In July , Hunt plans revealed that the contract was forcibly introduced and said the NHS would be in a no-none land and would be damaging for any further delays for the staff and patients .
The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve care at incredible times .
DR Ellen McCourt , the chairman of the BMA committee for assistant doctors announced last night in a communication with : assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and be failing to treat all doctors fairly. ``
At just eight weeks still remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running .
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with the government on reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence .
That happened to the one promise that Jeremy Hunt only made last month about that his door would be open .
Jeremy Hunt now has to act , lift the imposition and address the concerns of the assistant doctors .
Should n't he do so , so the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work measures .
The latest strike in late April saw a respite of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 deadlines , as nurses and specialists were involved in granting doctors on the strike poster chain .
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
The BMA wants a better weekend wage for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , director of the NHS staff , asked the assistant doctors to end the strike .
Mortimer said : `` labour controversy does n't reach anything little , but are already overburdened teams and service providers and preparing the patients , carers and their families only worry , distress and interruption . ''
Over the last two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistant doctors and with the Department of Health as well as other ministries positively responding to the concerns about the guardian and whistleblowing .
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as sending , flexibility in training , additional training sessions for those returning from a professional time , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training leave and the gender pay gap - a sign of how seriously it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Health Department regarding compliance with the BMA in November , February and May .

Despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time , cycling professional Tony Martin does n't want to walk up .
I continue to keep the World Cup in mind , remain confident and fighting further , `` the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook .
He did n't have a statement for his miserable 12th place on sugar .
I 'm honestly struggling to comment on the time yesterday , `` Martin thinks .
He would have to calmly analyze what reasons had led to the debacle .
At the time World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin actually wanted to fight the title .
I 'm going to look at everything we have changed in recent times. ``
This is what matters my position , too , wrote the three-time temporary champion who lost on Wednesday to the 54.5 million more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara ( Switzerland ) .

Salzburg 's West Side Story with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the West Side Story , with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Julia .
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
A Musical captures Salzburg : the West Side Story , Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece .
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and met with the role of Mary a youth dream .
In the orchestra , the Simón Bolívar orchestra , led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel : this music is full of rhythm , he swarms .
We always say it is very Latin American .
There are a lot of Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
It 's a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say we really have Bernst 's music in our blood !
In this production , Bartoli plays an older Maria .
She remembers with hurt of her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
The role of Mary has always fascinated me .
First , because it 's musically extraordinary !
And then there would be Maria 's personality .
She says in her song : `` I feel pretty , oh pretty , feel pretty and witty and bright . ''
So it 's wise , of course , naive , and very passionate .
She resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as a Roman , laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It 's such an honour for us to work with it .
She is an immensely generous person .
And Bartoli gives the compliment back : `` Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! !
Conducting is a necessity for him .
You see it in every one of his movements , in his looks , it 's his life !
It 's such a huge chance of sharing this musical experience with him .
We both have a more southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that 's very important at all !
For American director Philip World , McKinley is the West Side Story highly topical : this piece is about prejudice and fanaticism. ``
Today we have the refugees , then the Puertorians went to New York , and the New York residents did n't want them .
They are the same issues and they are just as meaningful today as they are .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid

Assistant doctors strike : calls for new work measures
Deputies from the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour measures in their disputes relating to a new contract .
The Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has called for its entire advice to approve more work measures at the beginning of September .
The JDC said it had failed ministers to worry about the contract .
Assistant doctors and medical students voted on rejection of a contract in July , which was agreed with the BMA .
He was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
In a letter to the members , published on Twitter on Thursday night , the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said the government would have been persistently quiet on problems , leading to the contract rejected .
She said : `` considering this , the JDC board voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official new negotiations to all your concerns . ''
In response to the government 's silence , the JDC board today requested a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour measures beginning in early September .
The disputes led to assistant doctors striker this year six times , the first overall outages in the NHS 's history .
The head of BMA assistant doctors Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA .
He told BMA members during the meetings that were still taking place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and adopted .
After the vote , Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly being introduced .

Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all that .
Dynamically on the spring .
Effortless on the beam .
Breathtaking on the ground .
On whole line brilliant .
And now , finally , Olympic champion .
The 19-year-old American Turner climbed on Thursday to multiple titles and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world all eyes under the headlights of the Olympic Games .
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and Final Five 's team cameramen Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina .
The Americans Simonen Biles turned on the balance during the women 's individual campaign finale at the 2016 Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multiple title and overall the fifth while consolidating her reputation , being the best of her generation or even ever .
She broke in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment an end .
This success puts them into the same league like unique athletes such as Michael Phelps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated the last three years of their sport , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises including a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said that she 's been `` the best turner I 've ever seen . ''
It expected a last examination in Brazil , a contest that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations .
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be seen as a disappointment .
The Americans Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace gold and silver in the women 's individual campaign final at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while she served on the farewell ceremony of the retirement team co-ordinator , Martha Karolyi , as exclamation mark .
Although Biles insisted , during their long way to the top , never having the future planned , it 's not really true .
Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical tumbling passport - is voted on Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympics in Rio .
That 's not a coincidence .
This girl , who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boormat 's mother during a school holiday in the gym , was trained in the Boorman became strength .
She has n't lost an additional contest since the summer of 2013 , a victory series that will last for so long as it wants Biles .
Even though Mustafina led easily through two rotations , the picture .
Sweeping beams and ground turbines - in which Biles hold the World Championship title - laughed .
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floor beam - and put one still on the floor with a 15,933 on the ground .
Raisman embraced them gently as she expected her final completion - a mere formality - and tears poured on Biles shiny red , white and blue eyeliners , when the vision she once described her in her collection book was to reality .
The performance of Raisman was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggled to third place , but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina .
This time , the 22-year-old team captain , which is named by the Americans grandma , had an advantage .
According to her ground exercise , she threw out to the audience , overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful .
As for Biles , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new importance :

Britain picks silver in 7-7 rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold
Britain 's impressive performance at 7-7 rugby arrived in the final Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the final hurdle in the form of Fiji , when it was beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji issued a master class in handling , side stepping , neighbours , line and raw force to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour .
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain 's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
The clear defeat of the boks , 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the finals .
But , regardless , Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form in this form .
It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fijis chief coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind .
Eight years ago , they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens .
They lost only here .
This slap will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks GBs out of fun .
It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were going to run in travelling buses ... the World Series winners went 5-0 up , when Osea Kolinisau rebounded in the corner .
With still four minutes of season , Jerry Tuwai still added another attack from the right corner he converted .
12-0 and GB hardly covered the ball .
A heavy tackle from Mitchell stopped stopping the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal , but it just stopped Fiji .
In the seventh minute , JASA Veremalua in the right corner was a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new since the replay and there was still over a minute of season ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou presented by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gateway .
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break .
It 's like Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learns .
That 's how it is .
GB conducted fundamental changes at half-time by and concluded the Fijian gap ... . for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half well until Josua Tuisova gone through Fiji after a brilliant interim play .
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB , made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 , but the game has long been in favour of the Southern Seanslaner , whose fans sweated flags and danced on the gallery .
It was n't hard to admire Fiji 's playoff approach .
Mata Viliame set this in items with another attempt in the final seconds .
The pepper , the Fijis embraced and GB damningly beaten into the lawn .
Earlier in the day , Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a narrow semi-final match from the race - Britain 's transformation of the difference .
Kyle Brown brought the boks in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team , secured the gain - and therefore the silver medal .

In June , Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200million for the violation of two patents of Merck , which stood in connection with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a US judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct by Mercks , including the ceiling and other unethical acts .
During survey of the lawsuit on Thursday , U.S. Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead 's claim for issuing costs were created during the defence of the case .
Merck is trying to equalise with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis drugs , which can cure over 90 per cent of patients with liver disease .
The case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property on laboratory work that Sofosbuvir underlined , the active ingredient in the Gilead 's drugs .

Mother of a 6-year-old with microchepic : it 's going to be better
Like most 6-year-olds , Edmund Picciuto loves the singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
But like the least of his ages , Edmund microcerchaly , the result of a genetic disorder , over his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did n't know during her pregnancy .
When he first came home he was my first thought , I do n't create that .
I do n't create that .
I did n't let that .
What 's not true at all -- of course you have left on it , `` she said .
Her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund can never realise them in circumstances and that he may not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far as to propose to institutionalise him .
`` My first answer was I did n't know that people still do , '' explained Picciuto .
Edmund can run with the help of an aid .
Edmund could not sit down or crawl until his third year and he can still not speak .
But he is slowly progressing .
He can walk with support and bike riding .
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund for 'Please sing me something about it. ``
`` We bring him character language at , '' Picciuto told CBS News .
But it 's not a typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some signs alone .
Microcerchaly has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the zikavirus during pregnancy .
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
It 's too early to say how it will affect the lives of those with the Zikavirus infected .
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
What will happen ?
And she still does n't really know .
I have n't asked for a long time after the forecast because I do n't expect someone to really tell me .
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus .
It will be better .
You know it will be better for you .
You 'll love your child and your child will love you .

Community , Spirit , Health : singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already accompanying her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in teaching studies she finished the complete music , and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior chorus .
Singing moves me - emotionally and physically , `` she describes .
After a sample , she feels balanced , happily and overall , she says .
By the way , she does something good about her health and spirit .
Because singing is right from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hackler of Deutsche Seniorleniga .
Most seniors sing in the chorus and share with equalisers the pleasure of the music , describing Hackler .
Through the regular connection , seniors can make social contacts and maintain .
For frequently , social and family structures are solving age , a chorus then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her chorus : 'to organise and organize yourself to leave on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of combination. ``
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense , means Hackler .
For this is where seniors train a deep and controlled breathing .
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs also does n't get out of the puste every day .
Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice aged , singing is an optimal hobby .
On older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula Lenz of the federal working community of senior organisations .
In older generations , common singing had a much higher importance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and recreation , she explains .
Lenz observes frequently that singing or listening to songs among older people raises many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time .
Through lyrics and particularly melodies , even demeaning people are resisting long back events .
When singing , the head is also demanded a special performance , explains Lein .
At the same time focusing on their own voice and on a predetermined rhythm and adapting themselves to the other singers - that 's a great cognitive challenge .
Just older people who live alone are practicing , not only to focus on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition you learn through the singing in the chorus , thinks Hackler .
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
Self-esteem is also growing through the singing in the chorus .
Showing yourself : if I long for something , I will be better and growing across me - strengthening that experience .
Good reasons to begin with the singing , therefore , there is enough .
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent advises Lenz .
You do n't sing alone - at 50 singing people , who 's listening already when a tone goes along ?
Looking for the appropriate offer , seniors have different possibilities , says Hackler .
Singing someone from the acquaintance group in a senior choir , you can just join .
Many cities are also offering overviews about the choirs in the area .
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the community or the church appearance .
Many senior choirs are also found over the internet .
If you have no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours are asking for help in the Internet search .
Who desires to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises Hackler .
Singing the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to any age .

Culture of Political Correctness leaves voter fraud in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on prompting a government report for corruption from office
A culture of political Correctness has meant that widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities will be knowingly ignored as a damning government report disclosed today .
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles attacks police , electorate observers and city halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of over sensitivities relating to ethnic and religion .
The former minister of integration and local government , which is now a corruption king , said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up shutout bands outside electoral cabins to protect intermittent voters .
He recommends voters should lead an ID to prove their identity in elections .
At present , one voter must merely call his name and address .
The report suggests that not remote ink on the finger of a person when they make their electoral votes to prevent someone choosing twice .
Whistleblowers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups .
This is not only serving against electoral fraud , but is also intended to protect the local government before the broader corruption and financial fraud culture , which is accompanied by it , `` he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London .
Last year , a special election court decided that the acting Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way , and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations .
Rahman is said to have his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the episode of an imitation where one person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
He was particularly alarming to the fraudulent postal ballot - at the elderly members of the Muslim community to pressure people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including leading expectations to prove the identity
In his report , it said : as evidence has been appropriate that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , particularly women and young people to vote , according to the will of the elderly , particularly communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds .
There was concern that ... state institutions have known such behaviour because of politically correct over-sensitivities regarding the ethnicity and religion knowingly ignored. ``
Sir Eric spoke of 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists editing postal election documents to stop polls .
The report , which is being considered by Theresa May , also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social fraud purposes .
Consider asking voters before the election , according to your ID .
Not removed ink on the finger of a person once they delivered her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
Systematic reviews on a person 's nationality to ensure they are eligible .
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic briefing .
Ban that political activists edited full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections .
The police are giving the power to settle shutouts around electoral stations .
A legislative change that eases an indictment of intimidation according to the Representation of the People Act 1983 ( People Representation Act 1983 ) .
Photography banned election stations .
Requirement that only English be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
Intensifying the training to ensure that staff rule that voters go to the electoral cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it 's amazing that according to the Tower Hamlet case , there was no criminal charge .
The electoral court has explained Lutfur Rahman and his deputies for corruption and illegal practices as unsustainable , `` he said .
He was pleaded guilty because of a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
He also criticises the impact of the electoral registration departments of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : `` the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal .
Our country , as the mother of parliaments , carries a proud heritage , but the worrying and disguised spread of voter fraud and denial of some authorities are threatening this good reputation .

Snapchat 's anime effect criticised as an Asian cartarian
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired , but some observers say it is insensitive to races .
With its filter tool , Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders absurdity .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are unsurprisingly , property tools that create more than 30 million improved selfies a day .
All missteps enter the public .
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused of promoting the app blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal .
When this week suggested a filter that gave them slits , false teeth and unseated cheeks , it called some critics a racist cartoon of Asians - being yellowed .
They asked whether these repeated controversy pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat told that it had disabled the feature .
The company offered an apology : the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians .
But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filter to injuries clichés .
Others declined the animated comparison .
In an email , Grace Sparapani wrote , a Korean-American art student whose tweet over the photos were widespread that the filter was `` violating and said to be uncomfortable . ''
She added that it 's difficult to argue with the opposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not yellow , but that the yellow face was drawn into the depressing extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling wires .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration battle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
And Snapchat 's great audience of young people - who are diverse in terms of breed as their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensibility .
If one of Snapchats filters generates a picture that is insulting for a user , it 's much more difficult for such stuff to stay unnoticed when it used to be the case , `` said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to extinguish her Snapching account called on others to do the same .
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she said she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticised the large part of white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
Either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so they can make such decisions , `` said Chinese-American Zhu , or they have people with other skin colours that are working there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comforting to say what to say about it . ''
Others share their opinion , a complaint that left Snapchat mostly unanswered .
The company does not release numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but , according to a spokesman , the company has recently stopped a staff leader who focuses on under-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Zhu said , for its part , that she will let her snapchat account be closed and added , `` I wonder if they need more users like us to say that 's not O.K . is . ''

The charges per cubic meter of wastewaters are starting from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the wastelance plant 's Neudoff / Reuth / Welschkehl 3.44 run for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.33 euros ( previously 2.26 euros ) and for Azendorf 's 3.64 euros ( previously 2.18 euros ) .
At the facility in Azendorf , the sewage charge will increase again at the latest , when appropriate improvement measures are needed .
According to an overturned calculation , the water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 per cubic feet .
As Mayor Bernd Steinheuser ( CSU ) reported , when approving the budget through the council 's Office of Culmbach , it was determined that undercovers were running for these sewers .
The Casent Village market was committed to running the facilities coverage .
From October 1 , 2016 , citizens , as well as the business and industrial operations from Welsh Kahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to grab deeper into the purse .
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 per cent .
As administration leader Herbert Schmidt pointed out the panel , a recalculation of charges for the market community 's wastewater plants was necessary .
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over-related undercovers were also offset from the previous calculation period .
The serious charge increases resulted in all three sewers plants around relatively small facilities with a very low sewage case , which lies between 6800 and 12,000 cubic metres a year .
So because of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be serious .
Moreover , sewers are easily declining in all three plants .
Furthermore , in the past calculation period , at all three plants were not last substantial because of its age renovation and repair expenses .
The facility in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Welshelle , Neudorf and Reuth , as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the wastewater Azendorf , the mechanical ventilation facility had to be exchanged because of a damage .
In the Pumpwerk Welchenkahl , the nearly 20-year-old funding facilities had to be overtaken by reason and , after nearly 20 years of operation , had to dig operations of the first plaintiff , the sewage mud will have to be disposed of and installed an extra ventilation possibility to adhere to the water rights guidelines even in the future .
Schmidt : `` these extraordinary expenses came from advanced care and maintenance costs to take into account accordingly in the new calculation period .
The same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
Stone houses made it clear that in the three facilities , the expenses for the operation and entertainment in the three plants were fully running .
In doing so , Schmidt , the market community of major entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years , remained spared .
The situation for the named facilities will continue to precariously remain precarious , according to stone homes , particularly since the utilities area of the sewage association Friesenschabach around these facilities could not be expanded because it 's about deficit facilities .

Kepler measures rotation rate from stars in the star clusters of the plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue at rotation rates among the stars of the star of the pleadays .
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in star clutches roar at different rates as well as in what connection the rotation periods are with the planetary creation .
We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the crowd of a star , his age and even the story of his solar system , `` said Luisa Rebull , a researcher at the Caltech 's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The star of the pleadances is 445 light-years from Earth .
Many stars in this star cluster , which emerged about 125 million years ago , now reach adulthood .
They are now turning themselves at the fastest .
To top rotation rates , these maturing stars encounter large amounts of stern winds .
As these winds travel through the stars ' magnetic fields , they have a braking effect on the stars .
When a star alters , its rotation rate begins to slow .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of every star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognisable star blow -- like solar stains .
The latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that massive stars spin slower than less massive stars .
Rebell compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning pirouettes than smaller .
In the ballet of the pleading , we see slow rotors tending to be more massive , whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars , `` said Rebell .
Since the star clusters of the Plejaden are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
`` The star cluster of the pleines offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions , younger and elderly , '' said Rebull .
There is still much in front of us about what we would like to know more about how the How , Wann and Why Stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their 'dance shoes .
Rebell and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports at length about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the pleadances , which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal .

Data clue : so perfectly blackened hackers their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware currently target companies - and are successful .
According to a recent survey by the malware defence specialists , Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America , Britain and Germany have been at least 40 per cent of the companies surveyed over the past 12 months , partly several times victims of an attack with extortion software .
In Germany , just under 20 per cent of firms were already targeting a ransome extortion .
Forty per cent of victims paid willingly the ransoms requested by the perpetrators to restore the attacked systems and data .
The offenders specialise in their extortion software , according to observations of malware bytes , watching attacks in company networks .
If they are successful there , the potentially extortion range falls significantly higher than in private users .
We are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the software , `` explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the world .
In 2008 , most malware programmes were still designed to send advertising .
Then the offenders discovered extortion software for itself .
It was not until private users were targeting , but the change to company attacks has been frightening quickly in recent months .
Ransowmare works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim actively , she is looking targeted after recently changing files such as Word , Excel or database files , and after archives of images and videos .
These files encrypt the Ransomware and extinguishes the originals sustainable .
Subsequently , the software presents the demands of blackmail .
To get the filing code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptown Bitcoin .
But where to private users the personal photo database is at stake , it is all about companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down .
Accordingly , the damage falls out when a ransomware increases .
22 per cent of German firms reported sales losses through Ransomware , 13 per cent even had to interrupt business activity , in one case , people were in danger of life .
In Germany , hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of nurses .
We are always telling the victims : do n't pay her only the problem , `` explains Kleczynski .
But 80 to 90 per cent of firms that pay , get their data again .
For managers , it 's difficult to reject the perpetrators ' demand in the face of standing in operation .
The hackers in turn know this and trying everything to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , F-Secure security researchers investigated the user interface and contact with the blackeners and come to the outcome : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
They explain their victims by chat as they can pay by Bitcoin , settle freely available support websites , or decide for free example files .
And are private individuals redeeming after paying for a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted .
Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail , the hackers are getting more professional and sharing the work , explaining security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sopos : `` a single person can write a ransomeware around within a week . ''
However , it 's more likely that it is three or four people .
Programmers sell their hazardous software then in the form of a software building box to the actual blackouts .
The previous malware kits were created by buying the Malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one-off , fixed price between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 .
In the delivery range is an adjustment tool , so smaller configurations , appearance and branding can be changed , `` says Wisniewski .
The extortion then searches for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
So you log into one of the forums underground , buying the set by a criminal and instructed another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
The pay is made per infected computer .
`` Usually the criminals then charge spammers with the spread , explains Wisniewski .
The risk of Ransomware is now known at many companies that better secure their data .
Over 50 per cent of company IT leaders in the Malwarebytes poll trust to be able to defend Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software .
Accordingly , the offenders already pursue new strategies .
If encryption of data alone is no longer an adequate threat to successful blackmail , the perpetrators instead face the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , `` explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Klezcynski .
As a result , the damage potential , according to the type of data , is still much higher than before .
Also , the offenders could take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
At the hacking conference Defcon demonstrated security researchers as they could get a thermostat associated with the internet .
In the middle of winter , the clearance of such a blocked heating so many victims could well be worth a ransom .
If the perpetrators then rather than heating in the future block a whole manufacturing road in a factory , Ransowmare could also become an issue in industry .

Frankie Dettori reaches on prediction his 3,000th win at Newmarket
Dettori springs champagne after a double at Newmarket , which brings him 3,000th win
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British gain at Newmarket on Friday .
He put on predilection , which will be trained by John Gosden , on his local circuit with his second profit of the night a landmark .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
The three-time winner Dettori , who won before Ghayaryar , said : `` it 's something special . ''
I 'm very emotional because my family is here too
I 'm very happy about it happening at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago .
It 's not a big meeting , it 's not Royal Ascot - it 's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I 'm relieved and very modest .
Dettori takes the jubilator when he picks up the victory on predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the nine-time Derby champion had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it 's no surprise that he has reached that milestone that few have reached before him .
He has style and strong , but it 's his tactical intellect that differs from the others in weight control room .
He 's a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charisma has been thrilling fans for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked up 6,000 gains if he would n't just be just a weekend and great tournament jockey !
Frankie has already ridden in GB nearly 30 years of winners , which is great .
He has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that , he is an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the hallmark of the British flat race for two decades .
It was nervous .
A whole range of big tournaments , including his famous glory Seven in 1996 in Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
Three years ago he had difficulty initially when he returned from his six-month lock but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form .
And he is far from at the end of the day - Dettori once said earlier that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50th years of life .

Tourists in Portugal panicked after a deep-flying military beach overflowed
Sunniers in Aveiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the air force put an incredible crash
The air forces said it was on a training flight but insisted that no security risk
This was the moment in which terrified tourists start to panic after a profound jet crashes over a full beach .
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew nearly in tangible close to the sunbathers on the beachfront in Aveiro in northern Portugal .
The holidaymakers jumped when they understandably started to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what came through the clouds on them .
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media , said : it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it were crashing. ``
Nuno Arroja added : `` I was just surfing and it felt like the plane falling on me . ''
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the aircraft came from darkness and incredibly low
Portuguese air forces today admitted that the pilot of the P-35 Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to detect them .
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual because of the bad visibilities nearby , but the air forces insisted that safety was not at risk of time .
Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on the island of Madeira came to death .
Portuguese air forces today admitted that the pilot had to fly deep because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoking , which limited its view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Clinton and Trump 's economic policy compared : it 's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - which wants both Clinton and Trump .
However , disagreements are the two U.S. presidential applicants in tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental issue .
The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is underlying a fundamental , more philosophical difference .
The one , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep the doubt more small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
He , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming Trump .
He will massively return regulations , and he makes for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , by contrast , says the state has certain responsibilities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it .
That 's why taxes for the rich would be increased , she says .
Interestingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
They have to be invested , saying Trump and Clinton almost worthless .
The Democratic applicant announces even the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
Government investment programmes into infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by Republicans ' state-owned wings .
So on Trump , partisan discussions could come .
Clearers are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ride coal production in the US again .
Oil production is also expected to be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris Climate Change Agreement he wants to terminate .
By contrast , with her investment programme , Clinton explicitly wants to expand renewable energies and calls for : one country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs. ``
It 's going to be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be it. ``
But not only in infrastructure - including in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
TPP , the trans-Pacific trade agreement , do n't want to sign both .
At the same time , however , both want the US not to isolate international trade - but just protect American jobs better .
They are then to be better paid , calling for about Clinton .
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 dollars is a hunger .
He wants to raise it to $ 15 an hour .
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not very clear : once , he says : the minimum wage must be running , then he says he should not be allowed to change .
But the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps .
On one side stands Trump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
His critics stick to him so that the budget deficit would only greater .
On the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants the rich to demand that they pay more tax , and whose critics say : more taxes are n't the solution either .

How to protect yourself with Krav Maga of gun attacks
The world out is a dangerous place , but this video of Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you .
We spoke with Rhon Mizraci , a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at near distance .
Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind you , this video will show you how you turn for your robber 's turn .
If you get closer to yourself from behind , then you should turn yourself first , so you can see your attacker and get out of the firing line , `` says Mizrachi .
Take the gun then between your front arm and your shoulder before beating him in the face with your free elbow .
Strike him then with the knee in the performance and twist you , while the attacker gathers together against pain , the gun from his hands , beating him with the run into the face and moving backwards while addressing the gun on him .
In attackers closer to front , the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line , take the gun and twist them , so the attacker ca n't shoot .
Shift at the same time the weight on the gun and beat the attacker on the chest , then twist the gun from his grip before moving backwards and targeting the gun on him .
Sounds difficult ?
Look at the video to see exactly how it makes Micraizi .
But remember it 's more secure in a room to hand your money - unless you 're not a Krav Maga grandmaster .

Cats react more sensitive than hangover on cries of young people
Biologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls from cat babys have on adult animals .
To her surprise , the mian also did n't get the males cold - but they always behaved in the difference to the females .
Female cats can recognize the emotion of cat babies at the middle of the little .
They respond to 10 per cent faster on lutters of kittens who were in great distress , as scientists have found out from the veterinary university and the Medical College Hanover ( MHH ) .
Hangovers are also responding to the cries of kittens - but always equal .
Apparently , the acoustic differences between the miaue of less and sharply hit young animals for the males either not perceived or not of importance , `` said biologist Wiebke Conerding from the MHH .
She is an author of the study published this Friday in the specialist magazine of BMC Evolutionary Biology .
In a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pit of kitten shouting differs with the urgency of its need for help .
Overall , we have been watched nine adult hangovers and eight kits from the livestock farming of the MHH .
They were played for a call of minors who were taken from the burs for three minutes and separated by mother and siblings .
At the same time , they were confronted with shouts of stronger kittens , which were additionally highlighted .
The researchers hold their results despite the small sample for meaningful .
All the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , responded differentiation on the cries , `` said conversing .
They turned up more quickly to the loudspeaker when this call of the more vulnerable kittens .
This ability may be born or developed with gender maturity .
`` A surprise was that the males have responded at all , '' the biology said .
In the past , scientists have already investigated responses from women and men on baby noise .
Again , some studies showed that women responded more sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the biologist Marina Scheumann reported .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through fight with the coach 's cancer to run inspire
There will be no more emotional gold than these games and that wants to hot .
From the first row to the last , 220 hard Hieve , who go into the story , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra significance at their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa .
Even though it was just the two that sat on the helm , there were three votes in the boat ... The echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present as she rushed to the second Olympic game in the two without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport that set off such a scale .
Their dominance was absolutely , after all , her 39th unbeaten use , which is also unprecedented .
What we see is two brilliant athletes who slide across the surface with the elegance of swans , which does n't reflect the kind of triumph all the time .
Behind each gold in the row , a battalion to willing helpers contribute to the incremental progress that make up the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did n't know about 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all than was diagnosed with him cancer .
As he said he was risky .
I had bubble cancer , which is operational and they did .
If you do n't , he spreads everywhere .
It would have been a pretty bad situation .
It changes a little bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if this is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would enough .
That 's how it starts .
The rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
In the immediacy of the victory , their first thought to Williams , who spent an annoying morning spent something more than otherwise , trying to process his own anxiety .
Stanning , who was a principal in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan , said I was an emotional wreck this week , which is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much. ``
It 's repeated just how much me meant how much I and Helen and Robin worked .
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin , we would n't be anyone , so a massive thanks to him , he is the best coach in the world .
I would n't have a better person to train or want a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race over the last five years .
The couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could n't keep up .
Even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were very captured at the moment .
Helen called `` remains in the process , remain in the process . ''
It 's really important not to get involved .
We had a good start and at the same time we were not about to make something Tolles .
We did n't want fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go beyond and win the race , what we did .
The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glover must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall .
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did n't want to say that was my last race .
That would have too much pressure .
In London , it took around six months to realise I 'm an Olympic champion .
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
It took about four minutes here .
It feels so much better than that , `` she said .

The right 's identical movement is targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
According to several local offices , the constitutional defenders in the federal government have also placed the group under observation .
We see at the Identity Movement 's claims for aspirations against the Freedom Democratic basic order , `` said Constitutional Protection of Democrats Hans-Georg Maasen of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
So immigrant Islamic faith or from the Middle East is defamed in an extremist way .
That 's why we are now watching the movement as well .
The identifier movement is a grouping with French roots that have also been active in Germany since 2012 .
She turns against `` multicultural watch , '' uncontrolled mass immigration and the loss of his own identity through overcrowding. ``
Constituencies in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Berlin , Baden-Würtemberg , NRW , Sachsen and Thuringia - are already watching the identities .
Maes said his authority voted closely with the landing offices in the decision .
Groups like the identity movement are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , `` the constitutional chief said .
Generally , extremists are trying to address them with adolescent language , often with popper music .
This would be Islamists as well as legal extremists .
This is not a betul advertisement for its own thing .
The propaganda is expected to address people emotionally .
Young people are there in particularly vulnerable .
That 's dangerous .
Most recently , it had been given reports of contacts of the identities to AFD politicians .
Maes said he did not have any findings .
For constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point .
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people who are extremist to change their target direction and become so extremist .
So determining is whether such people have tax influence on the party .
This is not recognisable .
With a view of the significant increase in legitimate offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters , Maes said he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context .
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures .
There was the group 's Old School Society or Friday group .
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or small groups plan to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other far-right motives .
A Germany or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism , though , is not recognisable .
Previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Concerns expressed messages about the fact that many assaults went to the account of people who were not previously appearing in the right scene .
That 's worrying .
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene .
So many people have committed criminals who had nothing at all with right-wing extremists who may have politically indifferent or elected , for example , CDU , SPD or left , which then radicalised themselves through right-wing extremist mood .

Council rights centres show 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country 's most aid needs are dismissed annually by the community centres , while the industry has taken on the impact of further central cuts to already congested transactions .
In Queensland , there are already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for unjust delogues and the like - dismissed in their requests for free legal advice and legal advice .
Legal services to the community , which are already overlying , are making available for further cuts .
From June of next year , it is scheduled that these legislative centres will lose another 30 per cent of its federal resources .
The director of community law centres of Queensland James Farrell said the latest survey of the National Association of Community Rights Centers showed that thousands of people are already dismissed each year .
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a lifting of the federal government 's decision .
`` Queensland 's community centers are chronically underfunded , meaning that thousands of people are dismissed by important services you need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relationships , people with insensitive and crippling debt , families who go through separations , workers who were unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal and this survey shows they can not receive the help they need .
The federal government will cut the funds by 30 per cent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
We call on the General Attorney General and Federal Justice Affairs Minister , as well as senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these central cuts immediately , so people can get the help they need in legal problems .
Last year , the national government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
It is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their customer communities and that the Parasczuk government is investing in this important work .

Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted for the Democrats ' presidential candidate and her husband 's income of $ 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 % .
In 2015 , the Clinton donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost $ 5.3 million in redemption rates ; the former foreign minister gave an income of $ 3 million from the publisher Simon 's Schuster for her book about her book at the foreign ministry .
Clinton 's candidate for the vice presidency , Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia , along with his wife , Anne Holton , posted his tax returns of the last decade .
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to put standards on financial transparency , `` admitted Clinton 's campaign held Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion .
In a stark contrast to this , Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreating in relation to his previous promises to release his tax returns .
It is common for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns , although they are not committed by law .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have indicated a tax review by the tax authorities as a reason for his denial .
They are on train , writing Clinton 's campaign helicopter Ian Sams on Twitter , in terms of the publication of the Democrats ' presidential candidate .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump 's special adviser , said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax exams are not complete .
Trump 's critics , including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , have already announced that his refusal raises questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its business and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already toppled on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high-ranking Republicans Trump urged his tax returns to publish .
On Thursday , she also spoke to the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . `` She said to the crowd .
Politico has reported that Trump has paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and an economic journalist at the New York Times quoted a series of tax advisers and tax advisers on Friday , who said that could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett , which would ensure that people would pay the more than $ 1 million earning a tax rate of at least 30 per cent .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has his seat here has Trump to exchange a meeting on their tax returns .
Buffett said he was also undergoing a tax review of the IRS and Trump has `` feared before voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax returns by 2007 .
The Clintons , which now live in Chappaque , New York , paid on average an effective federal rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
The tax declaration by the Clintons of 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of its income was referred to as a wage , unlike most of all Americans .
Their main money facility was a cost-effective index fund , from which the Clinton dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 taxed .

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city at Main therefore in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg has the best chances of attracting from London 's relocated jobs and firms .
It 's very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote , says Michael Voigtlander , head of the IW 's financial markets and property markets .
According to the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether funds may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
For the so-called EU passport , they have so far been enough to admit in Britain .
These are just using large U.S. banks .
Several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
The lobbying agreement , Frankfurt Main Finance , expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
For Frankfurt , according to the IW , speaking to the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , combines responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the eurozone 's largest banks , as well as other major authorities such as European insurance supervision EIOPA and the ESRB risk .
In Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this one is less significant than the ECB for the financial sector .
`` Closeness to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , '' says IP Professor Voigtlander .
Luxembourg , while a large fund industry , cut as well as Dublin in infrastructure worse .
Frankfurt was much easier to achieve thanks to the big airport .
Also scored the city with easily available commercial properties .
In Paris , it 's not so easy to find free high-quality offices , `` says Voigtlander .
Additionally , the rents for first-class commercial properties are 50 per cent higher than at Main .
In addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
In a ranking of consulting Mercer , the city stands at seven , Luxembourg on No 19 , Dublin to No 33 and Paris in 37th place .
Even though quality of life is a matter of preference : `` with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , '' conclusions .
However , despite Brexit vote , London will remain in Europe , my business researchers .
The power conditions are also talking about : in London , according to figures from Landesbank Helaba in late 2015 , about 144,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , were 62500 .

Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is expected to be reduced to a back-office role , according to the bank 's chief executive .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the bank 's global ambitions .
The bank has since distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago .
During that time , brand strategists used RBS to protect other end-user financial brands .
She backed international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now she decided to put more national brands into focus .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all RSB references , the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will change to NatWest .
Ulster Bank 's brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other , smaller brands for retail business that will receive more importance - Coutts , Adam Co , Drummond and Holt 's military bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire .
He told the BBC Scotland with : `` the RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as to the brand under which our staff will be employed as we now become more to a bank of brands . ''
When the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became a global brand .
I 'm saying now that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals .
Each of these brands will be in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work under these brands with the customers .
RBS has already testified that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptions of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
It 's time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we inside ( we asked ) to do this to a better bank for customers ? `` The chief executive said .
It would have been very cynical three years ago when we said we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you 'll see a lot of changes .
We can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

Russia and Turkey : an alliance of outsiders ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
Russia 's leaders and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of the words and economic sanctions .
But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St Petersburg Palace , I ca n't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
There was the handship , yes .
But Putin 's smile was narrow and he hardly radiated heat , even for his restrained conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly from his dear friend Putin - according to a report entirely five times .
I could n't count it .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis , but will even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been so behaving like never happened badly .
It appeared to me his enthusiasm rather to indicate the opposite .
But one of Putin broadcast , sustainable cooling showed that the leader of Russia had nothing to forget .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the firing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was augmented .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia .
The offence was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend .
Rebuilding the venture will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , the state-controlled media led a fierce , unlimited attack on Ankara .
At once , it seemed the Turks were to blame for everything .
Most seriously , the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan 's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State .
He vehemently denied this .
But in St.Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan he wanted to hear .
Russia has been able to book a kind of victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly on hand .
Erdogan primarily needed all friends he can get after he was removed last month at a failed coup almost his office .
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there is economic motives too .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly banning charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
The number has dropped by nearly 90 % .
In Russia , travel organisers and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed .
They include a late-season rush to the Mediterranean .
This week , state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
A report in Vedemosti formulated as follows : `` tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow .
Ankara is furious on the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer .
This comes to the continuing resentment about the snap of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey 's relationship with the West .
The Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he called for support for the elected organs after the attempted coup .
That 's well noticeable for Moscow , which itself has a severe fear of regime change .
The summit in this lackluster palace on the seafront enabled it to Russia and Turkey , one as it once described me an analyst to depict an alliance of outsiders : two countries that feel violated by the West and feel badly treated and now allied .
Still , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacekeeper , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of first discussions , both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even striped the issue .
Turkey 's president avoided deliberately responding to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasise them .
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria .
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it 's certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other .

Why we Simone , Gabby and Laurie need
That 's what I present to me among the women 's olympics in the turn and this is for more than one reason .
First , I have been involved in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
And second : this team has three turners , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez , who worked inspiringly for many young girls of other skin colours .
The structure of this team , which Aly Raisman , which is Jeding and Madison Kocian , which is Catholics , makes everyone proud .
This team finally reflects the U.S .
It solided the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
Over the last four years , the number one among the female Turner was an African-American .
Last year , Simone and Gabby were # 1 and 2 .
That shows strength .
At the last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered .
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected , but masterful gym routines .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-championship event .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We are experiencing the tip of this sport , but so do n't look at getting classes across the country .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie struck all the same as Aly and Madison to create it in the Olympic team .
They are the last five because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team , and that 's that last year with Marta Karoliy as a coach .
But the reality is likely that turns are an expensive sport and Turner primarily continues in private turn clubs , which are being maintained by parents , which raise for the training , facilities , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their turners and families ) .
The majority of these turn clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
In these clubs , the Turner gets their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term engagement for the families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , coach of Laurie Hernandez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the guys .
We need to allow the communities of innumerable , young girls inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie , a more affordable and more easily accessible turnaround .
I founded my trial of 20 years .
At my events , we have trained free and affordable turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters ( especially black and hispan ) and trained national and international winners .
In September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high-quality guys who earn the possibility of learning and benefiting from this great Olympic sport .
Turns develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body , as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
This combination provides lifelong benefits to health as well as for school and professional success .
It 's the inspiration of this team to get thousands of young girls to get interested in the guys and that 's great .
It 's so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
That 's such an exciting time .
Thanks Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of Girl Power by the occasion of the Olympic team gold and thanks , back her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to become their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

Heavy rain , flooding gives cause for rescue in Louisiana , Mississippi
Heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to retrieve the emergency on Friday ... it is expected all Saturday over with more rains .
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisianas and southern Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains , the National Weather Service reported .
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and assisting the affected communities are already traveling .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the Governor 's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , announced that requests for flood vehicles , boats and sandbags multiple .
Steele said that alone , the municipality of Tangihapoa would have requested tens of thousands of sandbags .
A flood warning system is being used over long parts in southern Louisians through Saturday .
The weather service left announced that in this area , additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall .
A flood warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday , while in the area Mobile continues to rain .
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs , both of which are in Louisiana , will all probably reach record levels .
Meterologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge .
He also said a power-down flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these over the rivers will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas .
The river Tickfaw , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached on Friday at 09.00 the highest level ever recorded .
Rescue teams still cleared people from the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday .
Hansford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek , which is normally more than 400 foot from his house , increased sharply overnight .
He said he would have warned him another stepson who lives nearby .
We are woken up and pouring the water and pouring in , `` said Hansford .
It reached my waist .
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hansford said that emergency emergency rescued all three in a large military truck and they would have brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster where they were housed until Friday .
Krautmann said the flood was spreading quickly , as there were continuing severe rains and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions .
According to Krautmann , an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday tomorrow of 13.75 inches of rain .
Krautmann said the ground was significantly full by the rains since Wednesday .
The authorities said that severe rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and lessons in five school districts .
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a senior order in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded homes .
Residents were evacuated in two churches who have now both been flooded .
The municipality of the municipality of Robby Miller said the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed up by the flooding .
Shelters were set up in the cities and Hammond to host the evacuations .
Once the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , `` he said .
In the city of Hammond of the community of Tangipahoa , nearly two dozen roads have been closed due to flooding and provided sandbags for residents who hope to hold the water from their homes and businesses .
The last big flood we had was in March , `` said Lacy Landrum of the City Council .
This seems to be a similar incident .
In Mississipp , the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
According to his data , a handful of homes should have been reported flooded on Thursday , but on Friday , none have been reported .
Keith Townsson , manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
I 've seen water in places where I 've never seen it before , `` said Townson , '' and it still comes. ``

Building ground in double
With issues around building , the council has focused on focusing on the recent meeting .
With relief , the panel took the communication from Mayor Robert Plaz that will finally be able to start marketing the recently designated residential area. ``
After the property , parenting and development issues were cleared and the applications could be put on survey , the sale of the property in the residential areas of the residential area and Schönau-West ( area Binderstrasse - expansion section 1 ) is nothing more in the wake of interested parties .
The council is convinced that the construction spaces in the countryside and quiet housing community Schönau address young families and restful seniors equally .
As it said , construction volunteers can report immediately at City Hall , over the allocation of the parcels , the council is expected to advise in its September session .
To also ask questions about the settlement of other commercial operations , linked to job creation , the community council decided to change the land utilization plan in partial areas only in the spring this year .
For example , in the subject area , this will be extended there already designated business area around two parcels direction State Road in 2112 .

Pokémon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It 's fascinating to see how the world changed .
That teenagers and children do n't go out to games , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to rig on screens has been complained by many over the last decade .
At Pokemon Go , it 's about getting people off the sofa and becoming more active .
Time on screen was initially limited to the television , then on video games and more recently on smartphones .
So it 's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do n't exclude each other .
I obviously refer to the Pokémon Gown , an app based on the characters , which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a sign series , play cards and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , interest fell before the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
Market introduction in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded .
Within days , Pokémon had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , the players with their smartphones go out and search for Pokémons who are tracked with a GPS and , once they were found , can be photographed ( over a screenshot on the phone ) or can be captured .
A generation that played the game when they were even younger , joined the game and jumped for the search of the sofa .
In the US , the game led to a substantial rise in steps that return the average person every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch , which tracked 35,000 users , told the Washington Post post recently that within two days of market introduction of the game , the number of persecuted people who train 30 minutes every day , jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
The company does n't know who plays Pokémon Go - it looks only the raw data on performance increase .
Many public health campaigns , who want to get people to take 30 minutes to get off the sofa and to be active every day , met on deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and coming from people who look miserable .
Nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be overstated .
Anyone who regularly drives sport reduces its opportunities to disease cancer or depression .
Physical activity helps weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they 're fun .
Therefore , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people close on the hunt even new friendships .
As ever , there is also murky gambling spoils who always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could run against one door .
What 's supposed to be ?
It occurred a breakthrough .
Even if smartphone apps as Fitbit could already track our activity earlier , they did n't give us a reason to drive sport as it does this game .
The new will lose its allure and the use will leave with time .
Because of Pokemon 's success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world , while helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Flight : `` every fleeting woman has experiences with sexual violence .
Sexual violence is part of women fleeing alone , almost everyday .
When they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatised .
A house provides refuge .
In a large kitchen , four women sit .
Each has a baby , which is at best a year old .
One has put her little son in the arm .
He looks with great eyes curious in the room .
His mother stared on the table plate .
Until she notices that she is being watched .
She smiles and kisses the little .
The scene acts normal .
Until you speak with Katrin Bahr .
She is an area managing director of Condrobs , a carrier for social aid offerings in Bayern , and employs , among others , the issue of women on the flight .
The four women in the kitchen have fled .
They live in the Munich north in one of the few devolved shelters for their own women and their children in Bayern .
In January , Condrobs have made the establishment along with Pro Familia and Munich women 's aid .
Recently she was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
Men do n't exist - even as visitors .
The exception is a guard before the door .
It 's not exaggerated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight , `` says Bahr .
Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as hope to Europe , ``
At women outweigh other reasons for the flight : `` many steal themselves secretly because they do n't see another way out . ''
In their home , they made experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , honour murder , slavery or forced prostitution .
That continues it .
On the flight , that goes on .
That smugglers , for example , for a bottle of water call for a sexual act , is not a rarity , 'says .
And women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
Who believes that 's that once they arrived in Germany , mistaken , told Bahr .
Here , too , single women in refugee shelters would often be viewed as inferior and at worst abuse .
This means that about 90 per cent of women who live in accommodation in Munich North are traumatised , she estimates .
Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created. ``
Many women are so used to them saying nothing .
Or they do n't trust themselves to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big. ``
Since they often do n't know they would n't need more accommodation just for them , demanding bar .
In Bayern , the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees .
On the question of whether they know from a similar project as in Munich in their responsibilities , some respond with No .
About there is something like this in government accommodation .
Even in Swabs , fleeting women alone are not separated , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government .
In Upper Bayern , Underground and Central Francs there are in some community accommodation floors or their own homes only for single women and their children .
The exception is Niederbayer , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
The Committee on Rights of Women and Equality of Genders in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be housed separately by men .
In a study published for the committee , it said : it 's very important that men and women are being separated. ``
'Missing privacy or getting men and women together , it can be - continually - violence against women. ``
In particular , the laundries should be separated and easily accessed for women , standing in the study .
How much the women feel this need for protection can be read at the range that gives it to the house in Munich .
`` Since speaking around that there is , we have a long waiting list , '' says Bahr .
You could easily make up a second house .

French court rejects offer on demolition of business in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , where thousands of refugees live .
During a trial this week , the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to deflect 72 provisional businesses in which people within the camp , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that there would be a fire and sanitary risk .
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing figures in the camp .
They also led to the fact that the provisional business and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in distress .
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses , but conceded that the concerns of Calais 's prefecture were absolutely understandable. ``
The judge Jean-François Molla said that food businesses , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions .
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places threatened by the riot was the Jungle Book kids `` cafe of the camp , which is operated unnecessarily and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors in the camp .
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids ' cafe .
In a letter to the Guardian , it said the closure would be `` for these children of a disaster , of which the latest eight years old . ''
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of those in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - following a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer .

Disease case : when paying the organiser
Diseased holidaymakers get money back after their journey , when the cause of the disease is doubtful at the hotel .
However , that is only the case when more than 10 per cent of guests proved the same symptoms show .
In the negotiated case , a family on the second day of their Turkish holiday was hard for diarrhoea and vomiting .
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
Their disease caused the holidaymakers back to a defective treatment plant , which had allegedly polluted the seawater .
The family believe the trip was poor - and complained against the organiser .
In court , the plaintiffs had no success .
While the treatment plant was in fact defective .
But the organiser only learned before leaving the plaintiffs .
By then he had to assume that seawater was fine .
So he did not injured his information requirements , according to the verdict .
No contamination has been found in the water 's samples .
The disease of several hotel guests - perhaps by contagion - belongs to the general risk of life .
Of 691 guests , only 38 were diseased .

More than just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday .
In a room full of people I love brought me the sight of this cover to wine , `` wrote Kendall .
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar ? ) , crippled reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) , as they forget the cover of her sister and ending with a classic twist : they have all planned a surprise party .
This represents the cliché act nearly every birthday episode of a children 's broadcast ( Seacrest brought the sentence , `` '' you thought that we had forgotten you ? , with the honesty of a characteristic check on a broadcast at 8am in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity .
With regard to the September edition of Vogue , a new era of Kardashians began with security .
Kendall 's big sister Kim may have beaten them off the vogue cover ( she and her husband Kanye West were in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself .
September issue is the most selled edition of the year for Vogue .
With an extent resembling a picture band than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertisers ( according to Fashionta , from the 832 sides of the wood 's 615 pages of advertising ) .
The revelation of his cover star is seen expected to leak pictures of the magazine before the official announcement over the last two years .
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In recent years , clearly more celebrities have been modelling as a model , the celebrities are on the cover .
Oscar winner and Dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , after Lady Gaga had the honour .
But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the breakthrough model of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchap video ( even if it all true on Jenner ) .
They are really talented women who distinguished themselves in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the last cover , had with the publication of lemanoma one of the most successful years of her career .
Of course , Jenner 's success does n't like everyone .
With her reality TV story , Jenner 's position was always tense in the fashion world .
In June , the former Victoria 's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague , Gigi Hadid , criticised them and called her `` the pieces of the moment . ''
Those feelings cook again as the news with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover .
But on the mismatch appears to be past the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue .
She 's literally a supermodel .
She runs for Marc Jacobs .
It makes advertising for your grounding of Estee Lauder .
She and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps .
It 's sold of her made pictures of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to the magazine LOVE .
And in her leisure she is in reality TV , presumably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children .

Honda HR-Vis flexible and everyday life
In the small HR-W Will Honda will tackle everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivans .
Sounds quite overloaded , but the HR-V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves very flexible in everyday life .
Although the only 1.60 m high HR is small , passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the Fond , it does n't look tight .
The interior 's materials are well processed and acting pleasantly , only the cockpit top side falls something .
Versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at the storage room .
Not only is it a boot of 453 low at high-profile and 1066 litres at the reverse back opposition , but there 's the Magic Seats .
This is less magical than it sounds like : the seating areas of the return leave like cinema chairs and offer storage space , which is high from the ground to blankets .
The boot can be charged well , but the load is slightly higher with 650 mm than at the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 PS accelerates the HR-H thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large speed areas very powerfully .
However , he is likely to do a little quieter his work .
Pleasingly , everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
There is still another motoring : a 1.5-liter petrol with 96 kW / 130 HP .
A wheelchair drive is not being offered .
Driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between momentum and comfort .
The steering , however , is likely to be a little more direct .
The equipment leaves no desires open in the tested top variant of executive .
Security systems include the City emergency assistant assistant ( works to pace 32 ) , the collision warning system and the spurt assistant .
The collision warner is sometimes irritating because of ranking many obstacles than an approaching object .
Very reliable works the remote assistant .
And the intelligent Temporer responds to traffic recognition and threatens speed if needed .
However , there 's full connectivity , though , only for the top equipment : 7-inch touchscreen , Navi , app integration and more .
Two USB and an HDMI book are under the armrest and therefore are therefore something cumbersome .
The around £29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel are fine .
If you do n't want to invest so much , it receives the gasoline from £20,000 , the diesel from 23,000 euros .
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust .
With the HR-V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .

Should it be nothing with the election to the U.S. president , Donald Trump already has an alternative .

Losing Donald Trump the US presidential election in November , he would be the relatively needed : `` ultimately it will either club , or I have a very , very beautiful , long holiday , '' the Republican candidate said in a phone interview with the US television channel CNBC .

A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in best days of base to base .
According to his emotional resignation announcement , the 41-year-old pro on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays will be wearing the jersey of his New York Yankees .
I love this game and this team. ``
I say goodbye to both , `` the 14-time All-Star Game participants explained to the Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Three times , Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signature under a 10-year contract has provided him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
By the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he acts in future as a consultant and youth coach - in full salary .
As a player , Rodriguez long paid back performance .
With 696 Homeruns , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( Runs ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones .
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two more baseball players in the main statistics show similar values .
But in the baseball 's glory hall , the 41-year-old is not likely to be included .
For such successful Rodriguez - nickname A-Rod - on the field , so disputed is his appearance outside the place .
Already in 2009 , the superstar at ESPN admitted to having banned steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 , he was banned for 211 parties due to an investigation in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered a prime suspect to have received performance-enhancing resources for years beyond an anti-aging clinic in South Florida .
After a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
The league could even be done for me for 2014 , because I 've played 20 years without a break , said Rodriguez at the time suffisant .
Even his farewell days are n't noiseless .
While many baseball legends are given the big stage in their last games , Rodriguez had to sit frequently on the bench .
'My job does n't include a farewell tour .
`` My job includes trying to win every game , '' etched Yankees coach Joe Girardi .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz , and representing the conditions with pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson , sympathies of the fans of the Yankee-Arrival Boston Red Sox .
We want A-Rod , sang the supporters at the 4 : 9-0 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

Asocial family destroys delogation of social housing in Saltash , Cornwall
An asocial family left her social housing after a delogism with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbours .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebiccock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash , Cornwall .
After being violently removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition .
The walls highlighted gaping holes on , wooden diets were torn up , rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was shelled to the walls .
The family have been resettled and it is believed they live in a private accommodation now
Donna McEvoy , who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing , said she worried that the home was no longer repaired .
She said : 'it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe people do n't have to live in this way .
There are a lot of things to take into account as this property is believed to be considered not so nice part of Cornwalls .
The family is infamous and their reputation it is also .
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and police said that terror , which had inflicted the family , included road fighting with baseballs , intimidating residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive screaming , disputes and curling .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name stood on the rental contract , got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June .
In some spaces of the house that will be demolished in circumstances , old rubbish was found
It was in the property in which drugs were traded in the past , the timber diets
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly had to call police
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner this week violently from the property after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to pull out voluntarily .
The delogist was cheered by facilitated neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
One said : `` they shouted around anyone . ''
We lived alongside them 20 years and it was always bad .
The countless times we say police here are incredible .
This morning we could n't sleep. ``
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that 's not used to !
Now where they are finally gone , it 's going to be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities .
The family lived in the house to which police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years
On the municipal side of the community house , rubbish and old toys
He added : `` it 's a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family as a delogism is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing .
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have been courageous with us and have provided us with the information .
I hope this development will donate some neighbor to comfort and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
A dirty mattress left behind in one of the house 's bedrooms after deloging on the ground

Member communities are the communities of church , breadth , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach .
For more cities and communities there are water deliveries .
The current chairman , Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert Göller stopped as a waterway in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the purpose association back in 1988 .
`` His tasks have been very diverse and they covered water construction and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculating fees and contributions to emergency responsibilities on weekends , '' the chairman said .

The £2-day drug to cut heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after being recommended by authorities to administer this more people for an extended period .
The polluting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
The medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
NICE 's NICE has long recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
NICE 's NICE has long recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of which suffer another heart attack or stroke .
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fatty material in the arterial walls , forming surfaces .
When the belonging breakdown , it can cause a blood island that causes blood flow to heart , causing a heart attack .
If the bloodstream solves , it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who had already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk one more .
Ticagrelor , which is manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and is displaced under the trade name Brilique , reduces this risk by making it more unlikely to educate blood islets .
The NICE 's guidance draft , which was published today , recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a twice daily income of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre , said : `` despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . ''
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person 's quality of life .
The experience shows that Tigrelor is in combination with aspirin effectively in reducing more heart attacks and strokes among people who had already had a heart attack .
By a preliminary recommendation from Tigrelore , we are delighted that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
The information about the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years ; the draft guidance does not recommend treatment that goes beyond that period .

What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler expressed via Facebook to the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis .
In December 2014 , he first taken gold at the short race championships in Doha and at the same time posed his first world record .
Now , the former DSV Athlet Markus Deibler has placed via Facebook protection against his ex-teammates in criticism .
In a country in which an Olympic champion gets £20,000 premium and a jungle 's £150,000 , no one should be surprised about missing medals , `` the 26-year-old wrote on Friday on his Facebook page .
The funding system in the swimming sport is bad , while doping controls , on the other , were very good .
As a result , we ca n't compete with countries that promote very much and do not look accurately or even operate on the subject of doping .
I 'm not saying that the controls should be hired here , `` he explained .
If he wanted to start a comeback , Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start to the National Anti-Doping Agency ( NADA ) .
That 's exactly how you should keep it with countries as well .
Who can not be controlled a certain time before WADA / FINA 's independent inspectors must not be allowed to participate , calls for the electoral hamburger , who is now running an ice cream .

Once out about the price from the market , café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg , in which only to pay cash , which had no Wi-Fi , but for 15 years serving good coffee .
Of course , it was pushed by prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front .
The business Soap Cherie , which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cupcakes .
Locals mastered it as the last loss in a gentrificizing city .
The artist Molly Crabpapable wrote on Twitter , `` I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CBGB dead , the Chelsea Hotel excluded and Verb is now a soap business . ''
But if New York is changed , it is also reinvention .
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint , less than a mile north of its original location .
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
The coffee is still good even .
The new owner of the is Cisco Rodriguez , a longtime staff member of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
He began working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end .
When he offered a customer to provide funds for a new outfield , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , reserved a lot .
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
He led new ingredients .
On the menu stand sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and saunted onions .
There 's natural bowls .
The cafe serves no more beer , for that there 's fresh juices .
After nine months , Rodriguez said he noticed a steady electricity of old regular customers .
Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg , he said .
Recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
Even after being drawn to Greenpoint , she would take the way .
After the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee drink , she said .
I was clear that it was in coffee and at the culture in the verb that I liked , `` she said .
Now she 's drinking again coffee , even if she ordered a bleed chai Chai this day instead of her usual ICED coffees , which is another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing .
I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter , `` he said .
Photograph Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu .
Nowadays , Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said he had no resentment over that the soap business has taken the old business room .
Indeed , the owners of Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the casual coffee of the cafe as ingredient .
I think we will still go on her offer , `` said Rodriguez .
And traditional , Polish residents Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe .
A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to issue them soon , so his new neighbours feel welcome .
The location also has other merits .
A local juggernaut wants to fill and sell the cold coffee into the bottle .
There is a chance the cafe expands on a neighboring building .
For many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favourites .
Joseph Witt was regular customer and said he was destroyed to the ground when the cafe closed .
When the new cafe opened , Whitt said that entering the local and ordering a new coffee feel like a home return .
I had to smell that , `` he said .

Jewish director smashes Berlin 's hotel because Israeli preselection was removed following Arab 's call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots removed a media result after betraying that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-selection as it requested Arab guests , according to an employee .
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah , left his trouble at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ .
During his last stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel 's pre-election list .
However , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
Wrote Lanzman .
Instead , Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel across its own Call Center .
According to a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The answer he received there , `` shocked him , as Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel resident said the measure was an intentional decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel .
The reason behind it triggered even more raging in the director .
Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the preselection be deleted , was quoted by Lanzmann 's employees .
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadassman called this a big shame , `` the Süddeuthe newspaper reports .
We were horrified and dismayed by this event .
That 's really very embarrassing .
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater disgrace .
That does not require any explanation .
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , `` the official said .
The incident triggered a pretty great resonance on the internet in which people called the whole a scandal .
Some understand the Kempinski Hotel that it had given up the alleged calls of Arab guests .
`` Ashamed you , '' they said in another contribution in which he was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kurfurstendamm , stands near a synagogue .
The hotel quickly pointed out all the allegations and called the incident an accident and apologised at Lanzmann , The Mirror reports .
There was never a direct statement to include Israel into the fast-track list , `` the Southern German newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski hotel .
It adds that the country 's preselection was now added .

Relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
In the evening , you 're loosing forever around , and at night you 're waking up for hours awake , tomorrow is already well before the clock rings can no longer be thinking about sleep .
That 's anything but relaxing .
After all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than 10 per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing .
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
There are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can underlie diverse causes , stresses Hans-Günter Week , board member of German Society for sleep research and sleep medicine .
What you understand running beneath , though , is the insomniac , that is , an entry and sleep disorder .
Just that 's sleeping many people as unsatisfying or inadequate , says Jens Wahnknett , board member in the German home doctor 's association with practice in the Lower Varel .
What is behind sleep disorders ?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex .
Behind this can put organic , mental or behavioral factors , but also drugs .
Not seldom is the sleep disorder expressing another disease .
'Very early wake up is particularly during a depression frequently , `` says Week .
And it may be that different factors condition each other .
Anyone who , for example , has a band disc incident , can be bad , waking up every two or three hours and possibly catching up on everyday problems and concerns , Week gives an example .
This leads to straining , and sleep is no longer possible .
From when should you get to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
Anyone who does n't sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights a week and on the day should go to the doctor , Wees .
Impairment can look altogether differently : one is tired , unassuming , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irritable , has sentiment variations or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches .
To alleviate the sleep disorder , it 's important to find out their causes .
As treatment options come under , among other things , behavioural changes , cognitive behavioral therapy or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets is only exceptional and at most for two weeks - question .
Lower-lasting sleep physicians are hardly available in Germany , stressing Prof. Ingo Fietz , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping centre of Charity University medicine in Berlin .
That 's why , in sleep problems , you should initially turn to the home doctor , counsel .
The can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should be into the bedroom , and what happens ?
To investigate in the sleep laboratory , physicians , for example , among snoring with breathing suspects , during diseased daytime fatigue , at sleeping wanders or when you do n't find the cause of a panel disorder , Fietze explains .
You actually do n't have to prepare for the investigation .
You should spend the day normal .
Just please do n't make a lunch sleep , `` says Fietz .
After the cable , you go to bed at his normal time .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , you wear a nose glee , a breast belt and a feel on the finger .
In addition , a camera on the ceiling highlights the bedroom .
How can subjects get to grips with the problems ?
There 's quite a lot of screws on which you can set for a better sleep .
White counts : regular sleeping and stakeholders , not too long in bed , do n't sleep on the day , not television to sleep , alcohol avoiding and not looking on the clock at night - then that 's quite and not conducive at all .

Russia 's Putin fires Stafford Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov has been part of Putin 's closest confidence circle for many years .
The 63-year-old was appointed special environmental and transportation affairs .
In an opinion of the Kremlin , it is that , without indication of reasons , Putin ordered Ivanov 's dismissal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration .
Anton Vaino , who has been Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is former diplomat .
Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , made his degree at the renowned state Moscow Institute for International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the message in Tokyo .
It says on the Kremlin 's website ( on Russian ) that he was later log chief executive and chief executive of government staff .
About his appointment , he told Putin : thanks for your trust. ``
I think it 's the government 's most important thing to support your activity as head of legislation and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
Convince the smiling faces ?
This move has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putins and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the KGB .
As a chief of staff , he was one of the country 's most powerful men .
At a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed the Chief of Staff will resign on their own desire .
But despite the smile for the cameras , only few are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
So here is the episode of a sort of power struggle ?
No one knows that at the moment .
But the official claim - that a man who was once being toured as a potential president , wants to guide Russian environmental policy at once - had great scepticism .
In his remarks to Putin , quoting on the Kremlin 's website , Ivanov said it 's true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to me to trust this very complicated post - you might nearly say - to trust an appealing post four years .
As it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov took the post in December 2011 .
Before , he was deputy prime minister and defence minister .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB .
In the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , who replaced the KGB , Ivanov was appointed to his deputy .
When Putin got to power , Ivanov called Ivanov as one of five people he most familiarised .
Once agreed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin 's second term , as a third term Putin had violated the constitution .
But this post was taken by another , almost ally Putin 's ally , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming the president three and a half years later .

England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and across London , but all over the country .
For me , this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows , just as it was then in 2012 in London when we run a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
The Olympics brought big benefits for Stratford and the East End .
And that 's going to get back by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow .
For our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blamed on the world stage .
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcoming , but Heathrow answers every question he asked .
Like the Olympics , Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £211bn of wildlife growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB .
We have a great team in Heathrow , which has implemented a £11bn infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , which was elected five years in a row to the world 's best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built amid the world 's two most frequented catwalks .
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk , which is supported by £16 billion in private investment .
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow 's expansion will also be one .
It 's time we draw this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment on which England can be proud .
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Boards and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury

Consumer research company GfK exchanged its boss Matthias Hartmann .

GfK board leader wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
The chairman of GfK 's supervisory board Arno Mahlert already divorces with effect September 12 from the supervisory board .

Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011 .
But the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , `` they said .
Given the latest bad GfK business figures , every shareholder will eventually be troubled .

With €361.2 million , sales were up 6.1 per cent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year .

The company experience needed in the Consumer Experience 's business division of £139 million provided the corporation under the stroke a loss of £148.2 million .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GfK was still generating a group profit of 19.7 million .
