The depressing eating of the economic crisis in `` a plentiful meal ''
In March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
As gourmets , President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup .
His menu that day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato püree and as dessert a plum pudding .
`` It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , '' Jane Ziegelman said .
Her husband , Andrew Coe , added , `` It was also a message to Americans how they should eat . ''
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coe 's last book , `` Chop Suey , '' was from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegelman told `` 97 orchard '' about living in a residential home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
Her latest collaboration , `` A Decent meal , '' which will appear at Harper Verlag on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter at Eisenberg 's Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , snappy snack in the FlatIron District , which has already been in business since the 1929 stock market crash .
Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Coe , 57 , turkey with potato püree and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered hackers , this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
`` Wealthy foods were very popular , '' Ziegelman said .
There were peanut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
They were made of an ingredient and something cheap that stretched the ingredient .
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner .
Coe gringest .
`` It must have been in the stomach like lead , '' he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , was an all-you-can-eat buffet .
Women 's teams cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastete was served for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first world war . `` A Square Meal '' painted the ways the country went about not being the land of sheep .
`` It was a time when food became a central , tense issue for Americans , '' Coe added , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
Just as tense was the new budget diet : Secrecy foods such as brote and cashier reels were made to staple , the cashier role as a `` wonderful way to reuse food remains , '' Ziegelman noted , as cooks could hide unsavoury ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dry fruit .
Meat , which for years was the focus of American cuisine , became a rarely served luxury .
Peculiar mixtures were tried as a calorie-rich and nourishing satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind .
During her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with peanut butter .
`` It was n't a popular addition at lunch , '' says Coe .
Ziegelmann continues : `` It was surreal . ''
Peanut butter and baked onions do n't suit each other .
It was typical of many of the house economy recipes .
As never before , or ever since , household economists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - are pushing the country 's eating habits like that .
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become `` budget politicians '' and to meet the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
`` A Square Meal '' is a celebration of historical delicacies .
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government 's response to hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoover 's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude .
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen , he saved like the millions-heavy man of world he has become .
`` He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce , '' Coe said .
He was sitting in an almost gold-plated dining room and wearing a smoking .
He was gloriously alien .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to statualize an exempt with his stomach .
As described in the book , the hallmark of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most trosty . ''
Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food were discarded once the country got back on its feet .
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegelman , as well as how science was applied to food .
The couple admitted to having better understood Ziegelman 's eating habits when writing the book - for example , how she could n't throw away food .
`` She had a real fear of wasting food , '' Coe said .
Ziegelman recalled : `` She actually made people sick . ''
There was the windbag incident .
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg 's , they and Coe drew a dessert that they had prepared at home : the plum dessert that President Roosevelt was enjoying at lunch .
`` It 's called Prune Whip , '' Ziegelman said , adding that it was a common trick to miss a more modest recipe .
There was no swollen cream , only plums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Everyone reluctantly appeared a spoon in the teeth , brown glibbers .
Astonishingly , it was n't bad .
Coe took a hit three times .
Like a Can-Do budgeter , he said to his wife , `` A few hacked walnuts would help . ''

Scotland 's Callum Skinner crashes home as Britons rush gold for cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men 's team sprint in Rio , when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself , making the legend proud when he stormed home to take a victory from the favourites New Zealand .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals .
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships despite Hoy 's resignation .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
They did so in time as Hindes .
Hoy 's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man they stayed at when they saw potential in the Scots , which has now unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round .
And the British trio won the duel with gold .
Hindes narrowly resigned after his round , but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it .
A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation , where Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and , above all , Skinner to keep the pace .
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner , Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the podium .
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said : `` It 's a flattering comparison . ''
I 'm just here to do my best and make me a name .
We set up an Olympic record in the final , defeating the world champions .
It was just incredible .
There is no better way to win .
After the 2012 triumph at Kenny 's and Hoy 's side , Hindes admitted he deliberately fell onto the railroad after a weak start .
He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England 's rivals .
In such a surprising victory , there was no such problem this time around .
Hindes said : `` It feels like the whole GB flags in the gallery like London . ''
We have come together as a team over the last three months .
We have gone so badly on so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
This is an event , a gold medal for the nation , winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
If that 's a barometer of our progress over the last five months , that expect us successful five days in the velodrom .
With Kenny 's form , it is in the realm of possible that he repeats Hoy 's win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , who was also born on March 23rd ( a seemingly cursory date for British sport ; that day was also born Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the same as Hoy .
Kenny takes part next in the sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said : `` I just enjoy this for the moment . ''
The team event is always best .
You can win it with his colleagues .
It feels a bit lonely to win alone .
Hindes said : `` If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the knights . ''
It was the only medal competition of the day , but there was further good news for England .
Sir Braiz Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the fourth-four-kilometre race .
They came in at 3:51,942 .
The world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3:51,659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where Wiggins will certainly be in focus .
He had contested himself yesterday with representatives before the qualification , when he called on him to measure his body size .
In the respective women 's competition , which will continue tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie , in world record time , will be in 4:13,260 .
The GB team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a shar of medals .
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were down .
Dramas played out in the background , the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
However , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrom , it looks like GB 's now legendary reputation , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated .

In the midst of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Trampoline
Whatever you are , however late it is , it is the Olympics .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inescapable , a fast-paced baton between competition and aspiration .
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning pole that goes from the brake protection to the swimmer to the turner to the turner .
You ca n't turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour 's conversation in the queue at Coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there is Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who is at the Olympics for the first time at the Olympics and a women 's swarm with green , could well have been among those familiar names being sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and wellbeing TV adverts if he were a swimmer , Turner or even fencer .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting gold in Olympic trampoline .
The Olympic flame does n't illuminate every event .
Further from the centre , partly in the shadows , are the sports that are not universally recognised : air pistols shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
We 'll always have the chest swim and it will be long .
But if I can humbly make arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the trampoline 's discreet charm .
Although trampoline is already an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it has been so scary for the last 16 years that many , I had interviewed , did n't know it was an Olympic sport at all .
That could also be regional ignorance .
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in trampoline and has had an athlete until 2012 that has managed to reach the final .
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline has a certain outsider charm , in part because it fits the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympics .
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but just an accomplished enthusiast .
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonist citation of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of the tournament and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it .
The word `` trampoline '' comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as `` springboard . ''
Prospective victors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a series of falling movements ( turning , hitting and saltos ) before landing on their feet .
They are assessed according to the official Olympic program by execution , difficulty level and `` flight time . ''
Powerfully athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
The most common Olympic vector is straight .
Medal hoff must go further in their pursuit of gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down the pitch .
Not only do they hunt the finish line or the exit wall , but also in the television transmission , another cavernous goal : that of the world or the Olympics .
The targeted aspiration is noble , admirable , even fanatic - and it 's enough to even stir a spectator to tears .
But it 's also what I find a bit tiring even when I grant these games .
The trampoline offers a breathing space .
The trampolinspringer 's vector is up .
A pre-heat movement is not the goal .
He or she prallt , seemingly weightless like an astronaut , goes upwards , then downwards , then effortlessly back up .
There is competition here , obviously , not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , just the dreamy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It 's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
Women 's qualification and endrance will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 1pm Eastern Time ; that of men on Saturday , also at 1pm .
NBC will broadcast the Endrells as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
In the midst of Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to overlook in general tumult .
If raising awareness can only be achieved by angling and objectifying male athletes - as the male U.S.-Turner recently suggested , according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his air-ring , new fan base .

Jennifer Aniston : I always get stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does n't always have to be perfect or successful .
The Hollywood star has now made that clear in an interview .
`` I am always stuck in drawers or glued from outside labels , which have little to do with me and reality . ''
`` I myself do n't have the desire to always be perfect and successful . ''
`` Frankly , these things are more snuff me . ''
Jennifer Aniston ( 47 ) can only laugh at her being considered `` Miss Perfect '' as she explains in the current `` Cosmopolitan . ''
Most importantly , the actress spends her time at home , front television with loose dutt and Mexican food , says the magazine .
To the white glut , they raise the question of child desire : `` We women do n't have to be married or have children to be perfect , '' the Hollywood star said .
In her new film , `` Mother 's Day - love is not a childhood play , '' Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
The film will run with us from August 25 .

Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and `` title defender '' Zhang Jike 4:0 ( 12.5.4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided final .
Thus , the world rankings first took the `` Golden Grand Slam '' with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour final and Olympia .
Bronze went to Japanese Jun Mizutani .
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title one among themselves .
It was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick the single title in the five rings .
Last non-Chinese at the top Olympic staircase was former SVS-NÖ legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea .
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone , between the sentences and during time-outs they had no coaches in themselves .
They had moved back to the gallery and left their protectors alone in the fair competition .
`` The matches to here I played for my country . ''
`` In the finals I play for myself , '' Zhang had consistently said .
After the match , gold and silver medal winners competed with the China flag .
The match itself was unexpectedly biased .
Ma had really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set .
After that , he set the pace at the plate , leaving Zhang with a total of 13 points .
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected match .
Nevertheless , there were nonetheless plenty of breathtaking ball changes .
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1 .
In his quarter-final against the German European champion , Dimitrij Ovtcharov , the white russe had a rib injury , was then in medical treatment , had to settle `` eventually '' with bleach .
The Swedes Jan-Ove Holland ( 38/2004 ) and Jörgen Persson ( 42/2008 ) , by the way , were in similarly high table tennis age Olympic fourth .

Intercultural travel : Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the Waldschule attended the theaterpiece `` The invisible house . ''
The Nima 's association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
The Nima 's association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
The `` Class International '' of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended an exhibition of the award-winning piece `` The invisible house '' of the boy theatre Münster .
In the context of the `` Intercultural journey '' initiated by the Association Nima 's , 19 students aged between 11 and 15 visited the staging in the Small House .
Since the beginning of the year , the association , which has committed to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster under this project .
Most of the class of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and spearheaded little German .
Thanks to the choreographs , the scenic images and video animations , they have been able to follow the course of action , according to the press release of the theatre of Münster .
The association Nima 's , founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg of Sprawl , and the Young Theatre will work in the upcoming playtime as part of a music theatre project .
Between October and December , young people with and without the escape and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will be able to attend professionally directed courses in singing , dance , play and music .
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
The project `` Intercultural Travel '' continues .
Given the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to take part .

London schoolgirl who follows IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS , reportedly died in Syria .
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned from her death in Raqqa , Syria , a few weeks ago .
It was believed she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa , the group 's bulwark in the country , ITV News reported on Thursday .
Sultana was 17 years old and died , according to her family , shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England .
`` You can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people from ever making that decision , '' Akunjee said .
In February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London stepped into a plane heading towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultana 's family was told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .

Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires wealthy savers in the future to pay penalty interest - as the second institute in Germany .
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : `` It 's only about 139 customers parking 40 million euros on Giro or Day money accounts . ''
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an isolated case and sees no sign of it : Normal savers would have to `` not fear paying for their savings-sized penalty rates . ''
If banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they will have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate .
From September , Raiffeisenbank Gmund will require Raiffeisenbank Gmund from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Giro or Day money accounts .
`` The first 100,000 euros are free . ''
`` The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future , '' Paul said .
For some time , he has spent 40 million euros , which could be removed from one day to the other and which he can not exploit .
`` They lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , '' the bank chief said .
`` I ca n't pay for every million euros . ''
According to the polluter pays principle , the costs will now continue .
To simply leave the cash in the Raiffeisenbank tresses would be far too dangerous : `` I have already experienced four overaults , I do n't want the fifth , '' the bank board said .
Most customers would have understanding and switched to other forms of investment .
Few migrated to other banks .
The Bavarian Association of Confederation said : `` The ECB 's extreme monetary policy course is causing significant costs for all banks . ''
To carry them alone is `` economically impossible economically . ''
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account guidance , credit cards or transfers .
Thuringia Volks and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines in 2014 with penalty interest on deposits from three million euros .
Michael Kemmer , chief executive of the banking association , said : `` We do not expect retail customers to pay wholesale fees for deposits , so competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks . ''
A banker said there was `` a clientele '' on Tegernsee that is somewhat lush from the asset .
`` This can become a problem for a small bank '' if it hats free money .
Founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach-Egern , Kreuth and Tegernsee .
The region has known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
The Bavaria co-operative association `` is not currently known to any other banks that charge an outlay replacement for deposits from private customers , '' spokesman Ernst said .
The president of the Bundesverband of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken ( BVR ) , Uwe Fröhlich , declared at the end of June : `` The threshold of going into negatives to the private customer is very , very high . ''
Competition is tough , and it threatens to drag investors into competition .
Customers in Germany will not be able to afford that .

Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-battered and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared extra costs of millions .
Financial burdens threatening the industry from the extraction of electricity are off the table .
It maintains the exemption from the renewable energy levy at the plants for so-called own-electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the `` Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung '' ( WAZ , Friday issue ) .
`` I am really glad that we could finally achieve that after two years of negotiations . ''
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers , who use gases from the high furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to pay their cash .
The steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year , according to the German industry association .
Gabriel told the WAZ there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants will an EEG surcharge of 20 percent be applied .
But this is also not being collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany 's agreement with the EU Commission for the production of own electricity .
Thus , the status quo of the current arrangement is largely laid down .
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are particularly important .
`` In terms of our steel campaign , it is a first step . ''
`` Others must follow . ''
`` Even in the reform of the emission trading trade , climate and employment objectives must be weighed , '' said IG Metall chief executive Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe has suffered overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
Last year , the situation intensified as the world 's largest producer country threw bulk steel onto the world market in light of the weakening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are dumping price dumping on Chinese steel companies .
In the course of this spring , the situation has been somewhat relaxed .
On the one hand , import duties on imported steel have been shown to have an effect , while the economic outlook in China has been suspended .
What is unclear is how sustainable the price recovery is .
German industry primus Wilhelm Krupp remained cautious on Thursday .
Finally , prices would have stagnated again .
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
In the last analysis , Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works .
In the German steel industry , around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
In July , the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
They produced 3.4 million tons of good six percent less crude steel than the same month last year , according to the economics association Stahl on Friday .
After a brief increase in May , the manufactured crowd went back for the second month .
Since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than last year .
In the coming months , the association expects an improved order of orders with increasing output .

NASA climate model : Venus once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
Scientists at NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the venue 's past using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
The model was designed to determine whether Venus , with its hot , waterless surface and carbon-dense atmosphere , could once have shown similar conditions .
Scientists have previously hinted that the venue 's slow turnaround could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests the Venus may have had a thin , earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on .
The model also lit up the topography of early Venus .
The planet presumably dismissed more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic variability to house lives and protected from rapid evaporation .
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent probable .
`` In the GISS model simulation , the slow turnaround of Venus exposed its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months , '' GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a news release .
This warms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun 's heat .
The result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today .
The model brought out a history of Venus similar to evolution , previously suspected by planetary researchers .
Although it was once habitable , Venus — over several billion years — was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light .
As their hydrogen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect was left behind — venus like we know it today .
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters .

Frankie Dettori reaches out to Predilection his 3,000ten win at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket , which brings him 3,000ten win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000ten British win at Newmarket on Friday .
He set a milestone on Predilection , trained by John Gosden , on his local circuit with his second win of the night .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
Three-time winner Dettori , who won on Ghayar before , said : `` It 's something special . ''
I 'm very emotional because my family is here too
I 'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago .
It 's not a big meeting , it 's not Royal Ascot - it 's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am relieved and very modest .
Dettori takes the jubilee as he picks up victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the impeachment race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the ninth-straight Derby winner , had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it 's no surprise he reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
He has style and is strong , but it 's his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
He is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthralling fans for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked up 6,000 wins if he were not just a weekend and grand tournament jockey !
Frankie has already scored nearly 30 years of winners in GB , which is great .
He has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Discus
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the hub of Britain 's flat race for two decades .
It was nerve-wracking .
A whole series of big-tournament wins , including his famous `` glorious seven '' in 1996 at Ascot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban .
Three years ago , he initially had trouble when he returned from his six-month lock , but showed an impressive characteristic strength to trot out his doubters and return to his best form .
And he is far from at the end - Dettori once said he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50.00 life .

Condoms with chili powder , fireworks promote Tanzania 's elephant protection
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to settlements inhabited by humans - throwing condoms at them filled with chili puders .
The method proved effective and the HoneyGuide Foundation , which had the idea years ago , has intensified its support , along with U.S. nature protection , using volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolence four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals .
Previously , many spears used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Phone Day dedicated to animal welfare .
`` Since we developed the ... toolkit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , with much more confidence that they can keep elephants from their fields without damaging the elephant , '' Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a statement .
The first two steps include the illumination of the elephant with a torch and the blistering into a horn .
If he is not deterred , a so-called `` chili cloud '' is thrown .

How to protect yourself with Krav Maga before gun attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from DailyMail.com could make it a bit safer for you .
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi , a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance .
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from front or back , this video shows how you turn the spieze around for your robber .
If you get closer to you from behind , you should turn around as first so you can see your attacker and `` get out of the shot line , '' Mizrachi says .
Then take the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before beating it in your face with your free elbow .
Then put him in the bar with the knee and twist it while the attacker knocks together pain , the weapon from his hands , and move backwards while targeting the weapon .
In attackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , take the weapon and twist it so the attacker ca n't shoot .
At the same time , put the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest , then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and targeting the weapon .
Does it sound difficult ?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretended .
But remember that in a robbery , it 's safest to hand over your money - unless you 're a Krav Maga grandmaster .

Once over the price squeezed out of the market , cafe comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shameful café in William Castle where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
Of course , prices were squeezed out of his Bedford Avenue store front .
The Soap Cherie business , which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cupcakes .
Locals used it as the last loss in a gentrifying city .
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , `` I know New York is change , but I still ca n't believe CBGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel excludes and Verb is now a soap business . ''
But if New York is change , it is also new finishes .
A revived verb cafe opened last November at Greenpoint , less than a mile north of its original location .
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere .
The coffee is still good .
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a longtime employee of the old café , who is the owner and managing director of the new café .
He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new outpost , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , maintained a lot .
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
He introduced new ingredients .
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garniches like capers and sucked onions .
There are natural rice bowls .
The café no longer serves beer , there are fresh juices for that .
After nine months , Rodriguez said he noticed a stubborn stream of old regular customers .
`` Many old customers were also forced out of William Castle by prices , '' he said .
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , formerly lived in William Castle and visited the verb regularly .
Even after she moved to Greenpoint , she would take the road .
After the verb closed , she gave up coffee drinking for a while , she said .
`` It became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , '' she said .
Now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffees , which is another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the verb began in 2003 .
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing .
`` I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my everything-Bagel with butter , '' he said .
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
Nowadays , Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his everything-Bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said he had no groom about the soap business taking the old business space .
In fact , the Soap Cherie owners offered to make a special soap for verb with the cafe 's cold-hearted coffee as an ingredient .
`` I think we will still be looking at their offer , '' Rodriguez said .
And the traditional Polish residents Greentpoints have also accepted the cafe .
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
The site also has further advantages .
A local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold-hearted coffee into the bottles .
There is a chance that the café will expand onto a neighbouring building .
A new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favourites .
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
When the new café opened , Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home .
`` I had to smell that , '' he said .

Data cloud : So perfide blackmail hackers their solace
Programmers of blackmail malware currently target companies - and are successful .
According to a recent survey by malware defences specialists Malabytes among 540 companies in North America , Britain and Germany , 40 percent of companies surveyed in the past 12 months were at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software .
In Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already once target of ransomware blackmail .
Forty per cent of victims willingly paid the lifeline demanded by the perpetrators to reuse the systems and data they had collected .
According to the observations of Malware bytes , the perpetrators specialize in attacks in corporate networks , according to the observations of Malware bytes .
If they are successful there , the potential to blackmail is significantly higher than for private users .
`` We are currently seeing a terrifying rapid evolution of malware , '' MalaBytes chief Marcin Kleczynski said in conversation with the `` world . ''
In 2008 , most malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves .
Only private users were the target , but the shift towards corporate attacks has been terrifying quickly in recent months .
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim 's computer , she specifically search for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
These files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently erase the originals .
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers .
To get the final key code to the files , victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency bitcoin .
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , companies are about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production remains silent .
Accordingly , the damage falls when a ransomware strikes .
22 percent of the German companies affected reported loss of sales by Ransomware , 13 percent even had to break down business completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
In Germany , hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of health care .
`` We always say to the victims : do n't pay , it only promotes the problem , '' Kleczynski explained .
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data again .
It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators ' demands in the face of stalemate in operation .
The hackers , in turn , know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , F-Secure security researchers examined user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and come to the conclusion : perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
They explain their victims via chat as they can pay via Bitcoin , target freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files .
And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted .
Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from ransomware blackmail , the hackers become increasingly professional and share the work , explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos : `` A single person can write a ransomware circa within a week . ''
It is more likely , however , that they are three or four people .
The programmers then sell their software to the actual blackmailers in the form of a software building .
The previous malware kits emerged by buying the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one-time , fixed price between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 .
`` Included in the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and branding can be changed , '' says Wisniewski .
The blackmailers then look for other hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
So you log into one of the forums in the underground , buy the set from a criminal and instruct another to install the software on as many pcs as possible .
Payment is made per infected computer .
`` Usually the criminals then instruct spammers with the spread , '' Wisniewski explained .
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data .
More than 50 percent of corporate IT executives in the Malware poll trust to be able to repay Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software .
Accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
`` If encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful essay , the perpetrators are instead threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , '' explained MalaBytes chief Marcin Kleczynski .
This means that , depending on the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before .
In the future , the perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the Internet of Things .
At the Defcon hacker conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control .
In the middle of winter , the free movement of such a blocked heating could well be worth a solvent .
If the perpetrators then block an entire manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ransomware could also become an issue in industry 4.0 .

Accidents - Bus slips into crush in graben : eight injured
In the event of an accident involving 43 seniors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn ( district Aurich ) .

Adblock Plus , Facebook in `` cat-and-mouse game '' regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to bypass ad blocking are equal to a `` cat and mouse game . ''
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page , Adblock Plus released a blogpost saying users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network .
On Tuesday , Facebook informed that its desktop site would change the coding regarding its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect display blockages , which is part of the page advertising .
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes .
In a blogpost , Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that `` this kind of hin-and-her struggle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bypasses has been in progress since the invention of scoreboards , '' and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry .
Worldwide , according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe , around 200 million people use display blockers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile phone advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue .
The company has put it on display blockers on desktop pcs , as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook 's mobile app for the social network and Instagram , a spokesman said .
Advertising on Desktop pcs accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook seems to be rewarding the investment of such a step .
On Tuesday , Facebook informed that it would update its `` ad preferences tool '' to have more control over its advertising .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that adblocking new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
`` It is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , '' a Facebook spokesman said in an email message .
Ad blockers are a blunt means , so we focus instead on developing tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into people 's hands .

Treats want Nacktkalendar for `` women and for men ''
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Kalendar for 2017 .
But instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of topmodels for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017 .
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine of Oldschool Playboys was different because `` Playboy is for men . ''
I do that for women .
He seems to think that the Kalendar is doing it too .
`` We must return to the representation of timeless and classical nakedness , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , '' Shaw said in a press release to publish the calendar .
Women will want to participate in this project because it 's a wonderful work of art .
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .

Haigerloch : Pilgrimage to the gate of mercy
The ministrants from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna branch were travelling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg .
Four stages were managed together .
In order to bridge the time until the next tour of all ministrants in the expected two years , the Oberministrantenround St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage .
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and one finally decided for the Bishop City of Freiburg , where this year , during the Holy Year of Mercy , with the open gate of mercy at Freiburg Münster , there was a special pilgrimage goal .
16 minis from Bittelbronn , Gruol , Haigerloch and Holy Rooms made their way .
The evening before , parish priest Storost sent Pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage crosses and told the pilgrimage blessing .
Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen , where a mouthful of Our loved one stands and so the Pilgrimage of Münster was taken .
The individual day tours were surrounded in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing texts .
But on the other hand , the Minis at field crossings , chapels or churches repeatedly turned up to sing together a song from pilgrimage-related pilgrimage .
The local parish houses were available for overnight stays .
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller served on the mill goals for a tasty as well as a strong dinner and breakfast .
The second day went to Gütwangen on the second day .
Day after day , the stage went to St. Peter , which was the most strenuous route , but had to first climb around 500 metres of heights at the end of the heat and then get back to it .
The deserved reward was a common grilling at the bathroom in the evening .
After the morning impulse on the fourth Pilgrimage Day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the closing stage to Freiburg .
Relieved and happy , Minis arrived at the Freiburg Münster later in the afternoon and steps through the gate of mercy .
With a small impulse , God thanked God .
In the evening fair in Münster , the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by collaborator Markus Obert .
After the service , pilgrims were able to visit the Sacristy and the High altar .
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis .
In the afternoon , it went back to Horb by train .
In the end , all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience .

Rescue in Moelfre Bay : Three men have `` lucky yet to be alive ''
Three men have `` lucky yet to be alive '' after being thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey .

A controversial baseball star emerges
The tears delivered to Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in best days from base to base .
After his emotional resignation announcement , the 41-year-old professional will be wearing the trikot of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays .
`` I love this game and this team . ''
`` I say goodbye to both , '' explained the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Three times Rodriguez was elected to the league 's most valuable player , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
Until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
As a player , Rodriguez paid back for a long time with performance .
With 696 homeruns , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( `` Runs '' ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones .
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two other baseball players point to similar values in the most important statistics .
But in the baseball 's glory hall , the 41-year-old is still unlikely to be included .
Because so successfully Rodriguez - nickname `` A-Rod '' - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place .
As early as 2009 , the superstar admitted to `` ESPN '' to have taken steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 lots due to an effort in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received for years an anti-aging clinic in South Florida .
After a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
`` The league could even have done a favour to me for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , '' Rodriguez said Southern at the time .
Even his disparate days do not go noises .
While many baseball legends still get the big stage in their last games , Rodriguez had to sit on the bench frequently .
`` My job does n't include a disparate tour . ''
`` My job involves trying to win every game , '' Yankees coach Joe Girardi said .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and told the circumstances with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , got sympathy from fans from the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox .
`` We want A-Rod , '' the supporters sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

Better traffic flow on the motorway
It regularly stands on the bypass - here a picture of November .
But that is to change : legal remedies should be extended .
This is good news for all car drivers who stand in congestion on the local road every evening when they drive over the highway ( A 43 ) .
On Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16/17 August ) , the land operation of road construction will extend the legal remedies of 700 metres in the area between Hammer Strasse and Weseler Strasse .
Motorists can then right from Hammer Strasse right .
The great advantage : the traffic will be shared early , thus improving the total on the much-vaunted section of Bundesstrasse 51 .
The idea with the extended exit was the CDU group in the district of Münster-West .
The road congestion on the train operator nervets motorists between 17 and 7 p.m .
On weekdays , the backlog reaches back to the bridge over the Albersloher route and sometimes beyond .
The reason is the Nadelöhr on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Strasse .
From here , traffic is only steeped in traffic over the motorway bridge .
The second track had to be rebuilt well over three quarters of a century ago .
The reason : Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary power to take two-lanes in particular .
For how long this bottleneck and the associated daily congestion will persist , the relevant national farm can not say .
However , years can be expected : because the bridge has an official residual period of validity until 2034 .
For the extension of legal remedies , the farm has deliberately chosen the less-trafficked time in the school holidays , because of disability .
Traffic will be carried past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main , therefore , has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
`` It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote , '' says Michael Voigtländer , head of the competency field of financial markets and property markets of the IW .
After the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses continue to operate from London from financial operations across the EU .
For the so-called EU passport , they have so far been subject to authorisation in Britain .
That is what big US banks are using .
Several banks have already announced their intention to relocate jobs .
The lobby association `` Frankfurt Main Finance '' expects 10000 new jobs in the main within five years .
For Frankfurt , the IW said , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority EIOPA and the risk council ESRB .
In Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
`` The proximity to the emergency bank is important for banks as they can communicate so directly with supervision , '' says IW Professor Voigtländer .
Luxembourg is a big fund industry , but as much as Dublin , it is cutting down on infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the airport .
Also , points the city with easily available commercial properties .
`` In Paris , it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices , '' says Voigtländer .
In addition , rents for first-class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than in the main .
In addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
In a ranking of the Mercer consultancy , the city stands in place of seven , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 37th place .
Even though quality of life is a matter of preferences , `` With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , '' the IW concludes .
But London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit vote , mine said .
The crow relationships are also for this : in London , according to figures from Landesbank Helaba , around 144,000 people were working in the banking sector at the end of 2015 , and in Frankfurt it was 62500 .

QueensFerry Crossing : Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the QueensFerry Crossing 's north deck with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife .
It is the first of four closures of the `` deck blowers '' approaching each of the three towers of the bridge .
Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
He has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slush haste .
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Economy Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
He said : `` This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the QueensFerry Crossings .
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
Overall , almost 79 % of the entire bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth today , meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : `` The first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
In this fantastic project , the closure of high- and low-cost construction is the result .
After the installation of the last road deck and its connection with the north tower deck , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side .
This was reached 700 millimetres south by dragging the northern train bridge .
This was a massive and very delicate activity .
As the viaduct is 222 metres long , it weighs around 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at a climb of about 3 % .
Heirs , because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny - on each side they only scored a few millimetres .
Fortunately , everything went very well .

31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water purpose association , `` Veitensteingruppe , '' Ruppert Göller , is retiring .
The association is considered `` Bavaria-wide exemplary . ''
A small fine water water association as a role model for the major water producers .
So some time ago it was in the original post in a post from Bayerischer Rundfunk .
A little later , the Water Forum of the Unterfranken government paid tribute to the purpose association .
The work of the Veitensteingruppe taught `` Bavaria-wide as exemplary . ''
Behind all this is Rupert Göller , who was 31 years old in the purpose association , of which 28 years as managing director .
Now he was retired at age 65 .
The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe , based in Kottendorf , municipality of Breitbrunn , promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water annually , providing 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants .
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter , Breitbrunn , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach .
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
The current chairwoman , Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterwart in 1985 and was appointed as managing director of the purpose association in 1988 .
`` His duties have been very diverse and they covered water management and maintenance work , office and organisation activities , budget creation , calculating fees and contributions , and emergency operations at weekends , '' the chairwoman said .
As outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , plot purchases in the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurbishment of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the repurchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewals of water pipes .
There has been no stalemate and there has always been innovation , because water lives and drinking water is the most important food .
In her laudatio , she praised Göller 's loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived up to the water purpose association as if it were his own company .
A few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction in front of the Subfranc water forum .
He received a great deal of recognition and praise for that .
Rupert Göller , for his part , praised Waterwart Alfons Griebel , who worked with him for 28 years .
He 's the best waterwart and he was a loyal scarf .
Together we were an unbeatable team .
As a highlight from his point of view , he referred to Brunnbau and the restructuring of the purpose association .
However , the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation was the pipe break at the high container at Kirchlauter on January 3 .
Here , at minus 17 degrees , it will have to work all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once you filled the Pettstadt high container with hoses .
The management of the drinking water association has been handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter , who will take the succession of Rupert Göller .

In the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being violated .
After the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package .
But what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
And what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliatory .
All his proposals are `` politically reasonable '' for the coalition partner , says the Federal Interior Minister when presenting his new security package .
They do n't overrule anyone .
Other , broader points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in that .
As an interior minister , however , he is interested in results and in a `` workable consensus '' within the coalition .
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach , De Maizière has taken a little time away before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
But these are all the more extensive .
Some are already familiar , announcing that a new security agency is to crack down on cracking encrypted communications .
Nor does Germany have to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun rights .
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security agencies is also not surprising .
In part , de Maizière is launching a second start for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to criminalise sympathy for terrorist groups and knock off jihadists with dual citizenship , the German passport .
`` These will be difficult points for the SPD , '' the CDU man admits .
He considers this to be reasonable , nor does he claim anything that has no chance at the coalition partner anyway .
A few new ideas are also presented to de Maizière .
They are partly in themselves : he plans fast-track procedures for detachment and more ways of detaining people from deportation .
Refugees who are specifically picked up into the country are to check their smartphones before , disclosing social media accounts for a security review .
He wants to make some even worse for rejected asylum seekers than before - such as those committing crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers to conceal their identity .
Some of it is politically and legally sensitive .
Some are also still impacting , leaving questions open .
And on some points - in the unequal treatment of patience , for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
Yes , says de Maizière , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
But it can not be denied that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees .
In addition , many people worried about security , given the high numbers of refugees .
And things that deeply employed people could not be excluded even during election campaigns .
Internal security has been hugely concentrated .
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
The uncertainty is great .
And yes , there are election campaigns .
The Union and SPD are therefore increasingly concerned about internal security .
In the past few days , the two parties have been high .
Only a garish dispute over the equivalence of the federal police , then through a security policy collection of some unions interior ministers , in which department chiefs also call for a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship .
De Maizière is also tired of conciliatory sounds here .
From a departure from the double pass , he holds nothing .
We have befriended the discussion in Germany .
To re-establish it does not make sense .
And in a burqa ban , he has constitutional concerns .
Whether his own package is constitutional on all corners , and whether it is actually `` reasonable '' for the coalition partner , has yet to show up .
There are some things that could cause controversy .
But the SPD is also trying to profile itself on internal security .
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel only once signalled cautious conversation , saying : `` The SPD is willing to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . ''

The fees per cubic metre of waste water will be 3.10 euros for the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl waste water treatment plant from 1 October 2016 , 3.44 euros for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros ( so far 2.26 euros ) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros ( so far 2.18 euros ) .
At the plant in Azendorf , the waste water charge will increase again if appropriate improvement measures become necessary .
After an excessive calculation , the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter .
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser ( CSU ) reported , when the budget was approved by the Landsgemeinde Kulmbach , it was discovered that these wastewater treatment facilities were running out .
Due to legal bases , the Kasendorf market is obliged to cover the facilities in a cost-effective manner .
From 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial businesses of Welschenkahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purses .
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
As managing director Herbert Schmidt told the board , a new calculation of charges for the market 's waste water plants was necessary .
Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , it will also be possible to balance over or below the previous calculation period .
According to Schmidt , the heavy fee increases were due to the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small plants with a very low waste water waste , which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres a year .
For example , due to the low distribution base , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have serious consequences .
In addition , waste water in all three plants is slightly declining .
Furthermore , in the past calculation period , all three plants have also been taken up to a significant extent , not least due to their age renovation and repair expenses .
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Welschenkahl , Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation plant had to be exchanged at the Azendorf waste water plant due to damage .
In the Welschenkahl pumping plant , the nearly 20-year-old conveyor plants had to be overhauled from the ground up and , after almost 20 years of operation , Lopp had to plant the first waste water pond , dispose of sewage sludge and install an additional ventilation facility to continue to comply with the water regulations .
Schmidt said : `` On these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period , came to light . ''
The same applies to electricity costs , which were still well below current levels during the previous calculation in 2011/2012 .
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low waste water waste , the expenses for the operation and maintenance `` fully beat '' in the three plants .
Schmidt added that the market congregation has been spared major entertainment costs in the past 20 years .
According to Steinhäuser , the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long term , especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water sewage association will not be able to expand these facilities because they are deficient entities .

Police : 3 victims shot in serial murderer case while listening to music
According to police reports released Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in the first serial murderer case of Phoenix while they were in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway , authorities said .
The offender fired eight shots from a handfire weapon while standing on the front passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , according to the report .
Police indicated that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery , as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 that was in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix Sgt police spokesman Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks .
In total , seven people have been killed and two others injured in nine attacks in Hispanic residential areas within four months .
`` It happens in a residential area in front of a house , '' Howard told KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , earlier this month .
It is believed the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
Investigators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalised due to her injuries and later died .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Maleah still died on the ground .
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder , saying it was the work of the serial murderer .
Investigators found cartridge lizards and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room .

Gilead gets legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. official ruled Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs incurred from the Hepatits C legal dispute with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc .
In June , Gilead was cleared of a $ 200 million damages payment for violating Merck 's two patents , which were related to blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of wrongdoing by Mercks , including the Oath and other unethical actions .
In collecting the lawsuit on Thursday , U.S. Office Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead claims to have incurred the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Merck is trying to equalise with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with lever disease .
The case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and took possession of lab work to which Sofosbuvir was active , the active ingredient in Gilead drugs .

Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experience on horseback is manageable .
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of a variety with a few colleagues on the beach .
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old .
CHIO : `` Golden sports pyramid '' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hunted home in a quick gallop to feed .
One kilometre at that pace , I was scared .
`` It was n't a good experience , '' Langer says .
And thus the riding carriere ended again .
On Saturday , Germany 's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses .
He was let go with his family about the facility of the ALRV , and he did n't even get to a horse for a horse .
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO .
The reason was quite convincing .
The German sports aid handed over the golden sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen in a small gala .
The sympathetic athletes do n't miss out on awards .
Federal merit , silver leaf leaf , champions tour player of the year ...
Even the British Queen has already adored him .
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
In Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday .
`` This award means a great deal to me , '' says Langer , `` because she is awarded not only for sporting success but also for social engagement . ''
Langer has been promoting the offspring for decades .
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
With 15 other outstanding athletes , the two-time U.S. master winner was taken to the `` Hall of Fame of German Sports '' on Saturday .
Among the performers are the lightweight athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt , the Turner Eberhard Gienger , the fencers of Cornelia Hanisch , Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt , the ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe , the Bob-Rider , Alwin Schocker , the springer Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous of the handballer Erhard .
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday .
After the official part , the illustrious society migrated to the Springstadium , where the Lavazza Prize ran .
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals .

GfK leadership after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanged its chief Matthias Hartmann .
The returns came suddenly - but not entirely surprising .
The difficult situation of the market research firm GfK has made it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is becoming even more uncertain the longer the success he has promised .
Turbulence at the top of Nuremberg market research firm GfK : after again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate governance , the world 's number five is facing a personnel new start .
GfK chief executive wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board , Arno Mahlert , is already out of the supervisory board with effect from September 12 .
The executive board member , Gerhard Hausruckinger , announced the lead on the board as early as September 1st , the company announced .
He is to officially assume the function of a `` board spokesman '' until a successor to Hartmann is found .
As a reason for the returns , the company called `` differing views '' on long-term business policy orientation .
Details did not want to name a company spokesman on Friday .
Anyone who will be managing the market research company in future is still unclear .
In investor circles , it was said on Friday that the shareholder was most recently disappointed with the continued disappointment of the restructuring initiated years ago .
Mr. Hartmann has been at GfK lace since 2011 .
`` However , the fruits of restructuring are still not visible after 5 years , '' it said .
Given the last bad GfK business figures , every shareholder will eventually be restless .
`` If that were the case at BMW , that would also make the quandts like that , '' it said .
After setbacks in the previous quarter , the company had not stopped its loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
At 361.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the comparable previous year 's quarter .
In the first half of the year , sales fell by 3.4 percent at 721.2 million euros .
The second-quarter profit has mainly strained the company 's slower value given its difficult economic situation .
The corporate value write-offs of 139 million euros required in the Consumer Experience business unit resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GfK had yet to generate a group profit of 19.7 million .

Donald Trump declares his claim Obama has founded ISIS `` sarcasm ''
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign , angering that his multiple repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the `` founders '' of the Islamic State terrorist group were not serious .
This clarification raised new questions about the communications skills of the Republican presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public .
It also brings his fellow members , who are trying to take him into protection during an eventful phase , into the peculiar position of having to explain statements he might not have meant .
After making the announcement at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Trump backfired on the claim on Thursday , insisting in interviews that he really did n't intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
But in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was simply sartorial .
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day , where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation was completely serious .
When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump mitigate the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
The last storm of criticism is prassed on Mr. Trump , while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling poll values .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried again to return to the issue .
Saying via Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense .
At the end of July , he drew strong criticism when he meant the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but he later declared `` of course I meant that sartorial . ''
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift linguistic boundaries in politics and then backfire as required .
`` I think it 's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans , how they arrive , and then if necessary `` clarify '' depending on how the reaction comes out , '' said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who watched the language of both candidates .
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways .
Instead of firing the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Trump has adopted an even more impressive tone as his poll values have continued to decline .
A new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist poll released Friday showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida .
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks , he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor .
But while he is intensified in the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's Scherze has put his loyal supporters into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him , regardless of how provocative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , former mayor of New York and one of Trump 's most prominent advocacy groups , gave a great effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview Thursday .
`` I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , '' Mr. Giuliani said , so he was questioned about Mr. Trump 's veracity as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
It is true , in this sense , that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her backbencher , completely wrong and that 's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , where Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed ISIS to spread out by allowing the situation in the Middle East to be aggressively under control .
Before campaigning in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media , warning them to recapture on each of his words and be biased against him .
He mocked the `` poor , merciless '' TV experts trying to understand him and said , `` You ca n't ! ''
Some Democrats spotted over Mr. Trump 's apology as just further proof that he was unfit for the presidential race .

Olympia : Trieste cheating on doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya 's light athletes are at risk after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Ungemach Olympics .
Kenya sent a coach home after a scam at a doping control in the Olympic Village .
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
A Kenyan functionary had announced that the former sprinter and current coach , John Anzrah , had made an urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich .
This was reported to Kenya 's team management by the doping controllers .
The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information on the case to make its own investigations , an IAAF spokesman said .
`` Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC , the IAAF will make an assessment , '' it said in an IAAF statement .
`` He ( Anzrah ) has gone to the doping control station and has issued himself as Ferguson Rotich , rehearsed and signed , declared Kenya 's chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi .
He was in possession of the athlete 's accreditation , which was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency 's training controls .
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
Four days earlier , Kenyan lightweight athletics chief Michael Rotich had been dragged away from the Rio Games .
He is said to have briefed his country 's athletes on money payments on upcoming doping tests .
According to media reports , he should have been arrested on his return at Nairobi Airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences .
In announcing the more than 2,000 doping target controls put in place by the IOC before the Rio Games , it was unusually previously pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are specifically targeted .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system .
The law was passed just weeks before Olympic start .
As a result , WADA Kenya took on the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with WADA 's rules .
Kenya is considered a big runner nation .
The country 's lightweight athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
A number of ARD television reports repeatedly raised allegations that Kenya 's doping funds are easily accessible and there is to be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he employed her in Russian lightweight athletics .
It has been demonstrated that the sport has been comprehensively and systematically doped in this sport .
Russia 's light athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .

The right-wing `` Identitarian movement '' has come under fire from the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
According to several local offices , the constitutional protectors in the federal government also put the group under observation .
`` We see in the Identitarian movement evidence of aspirations against the liberal democratic order , '' said constitutional protection chief Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
So immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being defamed in extremist ways .
That 's why we are now watching the movement .
The Identitarian movement is a grouping with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 .
It opposes `` multicultural crackdowns , '' `` uncontrolled mass immigration '' and the `` loss of one 's own identity through strangers . ''
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hesse , Berlin , Baden-Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the `` identitaries . ''
Maaßen said his authority had aligned itself closely with the local offices during the decision .
`` Groups like the Identitarian movement are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , '' the constitutional protection chief said .
Generally , extremists try to address them with youth-appropriate language , often with poppy music .
Islamists like right-wing extremists do that .
It 's not a beguiling advertisement for your own thing .
Propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally .
Young people are particularly vulnerable here .
It is dangerous .
Finally , there had been reports from several federal states of contacts of `` identitaries '' with AfD politicians .
Maaßen said he had no findings on that .
For constitutional protection , possible contacts of this nature are only relevant from a certain point of view .
It is important for the respective party - in this case the AfD - to change its target and become so extremist by certain individuals who are extremist .
The decisive factor is whether such individuals have control over the party .
This is not apparent .
In view of the significant increase in right-wing crime and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters , Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context .
But we have noted in recent years that there can be legal terrorist structures .
There was the Old School Society group or the Freitaler Group .
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro groups are forming , the attacks against asylum seekers , refugee homeowners or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives .
However , Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not apparent .
The previous groups have emerged at regional level or on social networks .
Maaßen expressed concern that many assaults went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
That 's the worrying thing .
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene .
`` So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists , who were perhaps politically indifferent , or , for example , CDU , SPD or left , who then radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist sentiment . ''

Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after `` Arab '' call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media upset after he betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre-election , as Arab guests `` had requested '' according to an employee .
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentary `` Shoah , '' left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to German newspaper FAZ .
During his last stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel 's pre-election list .
However , the country was not listed between countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and erased ?
Lanzmann wrote .
Instead , the Kempinsi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own call centre .
According to a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The answer he received there `` shocked him , '' as Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel employee said the measure was a `` deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels . ''
The reason behind it was causing even more anger in the director .
`` The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be erased , '' the employee of Lanzmann was quoted as saying .
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a `` great shame , '' reported the Süddeutsche Zeitung .
We were appalled and dismayed by this event .
It really is very shameful .
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
No explanation is required .
We expect the hotel to `` draw the right conclusions , '' the official said .
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the internet , where people called the whole thing a scandal .
Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it had `` given up '' the alleged calls of Arab guests .
`` Shovel you , '' it said in another post , pointing out that the hotel , located on the noble Kurfürstendamm , stands near a synagogue .
The hotel quickly denied all accusations and called the incident a `` mistake '' and `` apologized '' to Lanzmann , Der Spiegel reported .
`` There has never been a direct instruction '' not to include Israel in the fast-track list , '' the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski hotel as saying .
It adds that the country pre-election has now been added .

De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July , many people would be worried about further attacks .
The state must respond calmly and decisively to terror threats .
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of perpetrators with hatred and division .
We will not give the terrorists this triumph .
However , if criminals have to leave the country more quickly , this increases security and also the popular consent for refugee policy .
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the 2017 federal election .
He also announced further human reinforcement of security forces , `` on a medium-sized scale over several years . ''
Sympathy advertising terrorism must be punished again .
Video surveillance is to be improved in such a way that the right of arms is revised so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult .
According to de Maizières , the most recently discussed obligation for doctors is to be preserved .
However , in dialogue with physicians , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the vulnerability of citizens , he said , looking at mental striking .
To counter the radicalisation of refugees , the minister considers better social care to be necessary .
Teachers must be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people .
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Darknet ) , de Maizière plans to use disguised investigators .
SPD chief Gabriel said : `` The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps further increase security . ''
It is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly opposed action .
`` That was a slap in the face for sharpeners in CDU / CSU , '' Gabriel told the Funke Media Group newspaper ( Friday ) .
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the union following a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
A general ban on full concealment considers it constitutionally problematic .
You can not ban everything you reject and I reject the wearing of the burqa .
We can talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses .
Greens leader Simone Peter warned the minister that he wanted to simulate power and ability to act with ever-new anti-terror packages .
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said : `` Fleet spells and a tightening of the right of residence do n't bring more security to the people of this country . ''

Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll , Friday morning .
She suffered cut wounds and was treated in hospital , but has already been able to leave .
Her journey home planned her for early September .
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket , as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens , is still unclear for the time being .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard , said Schnöll .
Hua Hin , located around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a fortnight .
According to police , a Thai altercation was killed and around 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
On Friday morning , two explosives went up again , killing another person , according to the authorities .
A bomb explosion was also reported in the early morning by Phuket .
A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the Patong beach , popular with holidaymakers .
Another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the country 's south east coast , killing an urban employee .
According to the authorities , the explosion was in the air , according to the authorities in a flower beet .
Finally , detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south west coast , as well as in Chumphon on the south east coast , were still called for .
There is a connection between the explosions in Hua Hin , it said .
`` The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting , '' Army General Danai Kritmethavee told journalists Friday morning .
`` We assume it is a coordinated attack . ''
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
Thai police , on the other hand , said the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or international terrorism .
`` This is only local sabotage , limited to limited areas and provinces , '' a spokesman in Bangkok said .
It is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta .
In the past few days , the authorities would have received intelligence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - though they were not informed of the exact timing and location .
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
Police instructed their officials across the country to step up security around key government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
In Thailand , there are always smaller bombings , but mostly they do not target tourists .
Hua Hin is home to a palace used for years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
After the bomb explosions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be given .
High security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings .
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need to travel to these provinces .
Increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place just days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta .
This gives the military great influence over the coming years too .
Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to stir chaos while the country moved toward stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
Military Unta , which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , is holding itself back to having led the kingdom back to stability and order .
However , the military has also failed to manage the uprising of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years .
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
Just over a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists .
It was the bloodiest attack on the country 's recent history .

Olympia 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Wide : Due to a positive doping sample , weight theater Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases .
A wired athletic would almost have won a medal .
Before the seventh day of the race , the first official doping cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3,000-meter-barrier Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically-charged athletic contests , these messages come at untime .
As far as Chen was concerned , the diuretic hydrochloriaiazid was already proven last Sunday , which is used as a masked agent for doping substances .
The International Sports Court , CAS , confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon .
On Sunday , the 18-year-old had fined fourth place in the finale over 100m butterfly , only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen should have attended the precursors over 50m free style .
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) to open the B sample and a hearing .
The national association takes the matter `` very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations , '' Xinhua quoted from a notice as saying , `` We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the ruling . ''
For the first time in history , no longer the IOC , but the CAS , is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases .
Also on the night of Rio , the news of the positive sample at Danekowa sickened through , the 33-year-old went into the offensive herself .
`` I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive '' this was `` an incredible shock , '' she told Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT .
She is innocent , `` the only explanation could be food supplements , '' the lightweight athletin explained .
According to the report , the banned substance is supposed to be the EPO blood doping agent .
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended , according to BNT , the B sample should also be positive .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow promptly declared himself with criticism at the athletic .
`` I do n't understand why the athletes do n't draw the right conclusions , '' he said , `` We Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . ''
For example , all weight theories from the chronically doping nation may not take part in Rio .
On Friday , the case of `` Adrian Zielinski '' was also known , the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabex steroid nandrolon three days earlier .
Both dispute the intake , but neither can start in the class up to 94 kg .
Before the launch of light athletes , the Danekowa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
The IAAF World Association banned the entire Russian team from systematic doping until an exception due to systematic doping , even the runner nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news .
In the swimming sport , the previous offences in China had also caused fierce disputes between the athletes .
So Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
`` Sun Yang pinched purple . ''
`` When I see the podium over 200m free style , I want to pass , '' Lacourt said on French radio .
Sun was also at the centre of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton .
`` I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters , '' said this .
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese championships , but only had to sit off a three-month lock .

Destination plates : who actually buys records ?
LONely middle-aged men love plates .
Before you rush to the commentary section to sow him under the pseudonym of non-all-male middle-aged age with rough insults , this statement is derived from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-discussed resurgence of records is not about a boom in millals that want to welcome the newness of physical items , but to midlife nostalgia .
Those who recently bought a plate are all predicted to be between 45 and 54 .
In fact , the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyers group .
Nor is it a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers tend to keep their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But do the results of YouGov vote ?
If this blog were a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho , wearing a modest grey suit and wildly stomping , holding my hands and saying something like , `` So , let 's take a closer look at it . ''
So , let 's take a look at it .
Even though Soho 's heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn out the camera for the next part , where I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and cozy by watching .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am from Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three middle-aged men ) into Reckless Records ( data number : eight middle-aged men , a woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
`` I guess already , '' he says .
I have around 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
These records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did n't follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy plates he could n't afford when they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and placid .
`` Many things I buy are from the late sixties , early 70 's , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 , things where I was probably a little too young to buy them , '' he says .
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone , adding : `` I do n't smoke and I do n't drink very much .
That 's my laster .
Wez , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers he meets are accessing the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the medienhpe , people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy their old plates again .
From the conversations I had , people usually got away from their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
Customers who once sold their plates to buy themselves cds now sell their cds to buy their plates again , '' he says .
That would explain the boom to followers of a certain age .
But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realise that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people .
According to Wez , some of the older customers took impetus in the contactless payment system .
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record hulls , from objects that awake happy youth memories .
`` I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation , '' Wez says .
That 's with me as a collector so I think it 's like that with many people .
It 's an easy way to engage mentally .
`` We are like their social workers ! '' a staff member flutes from a plate .
A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a plate last month had not yet listened .
The survey also found that 41 % own a record player they never use , while 7 % of those buying a plate do n't own record players .
At this point in the news report I would probably look very worried while I was blowing through a pile of bossa nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three middle-aged men ) , has noticed a `` trophy aspect '' of the revival .
`` Someone only recently arrived here and said : `` I do n't own a record player , but I 'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put her on the shelf , '' he says .
This is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
More productive , less musical .
We have people saying , `` I do n't have a record player . ''
These are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly come clean .
Fopp , who has devoted almost an entire floor to the records , has a blower audience when I go straight .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists making photos , teenageboys and middle-aged women .
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast 's latest synthesizer and sexy pop instead of experimental jazz , from the loudspeakers , it 's good to see such diversity with the customer .
None of them look very lonely , but nagging mental traumas are difficult to determine when standing next to someone 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been running around in the store for a few minutes and considers the variation of the plates for sale .
It makes more of a shaufenstummel than a big shopping .
It does n't deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It 's easy listening to music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... `` she drives off with a fallen sigh .
I do n't know how to explain it - it 's really unique .
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : Urban Outfitters .
While I seem to be mustering the jeans hotpants , I watch a group of young teenagemagoers grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player .
On the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Lockhouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , essential plates for an average collection .
Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
It 's pure `` plate art . ''
But considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Sohos , there 's nothing to complain about .
It 's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one who is spending most on luxury items like plates .
Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov vote , they leave , at least in record shops in Soho , the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
They certainly do n't spend their Thursday morning with banging through record shops of Berwick Street and browsing through plates , while avoiding the startling sight of an uncanny , 30-year-old wrong presenter who racks over the shoulders of middle-aged men .

Reid says Clinton will stay at Garland in case of electoral victory at Garland
Harry Reid , leader of Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court .
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland 's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March .
Majority leader in Senate Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge , Antonin Scalia .
Reid said Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland `` with a certain degree of certainty . ''
A Reid spokeswoman later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated .
He praised Garland , saying Clinton 's team would not care for unrest with a new candidate .
Garland is the top judge for the U.S. Appellation Court for the District of Columbia .
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland 's nomination , be lacklustre and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
He also noted that Donald Trump is unfit for the presidential race .

Berlin / Schwerin : Poll before country election : SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( September 4th ) and Berlin ( September 18th ) significant losses are emerging for the governing parties SPD and CDU .
These were representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the `` Bild '' newspaper ( Friday ) .
While the red-black government coalition could rule narrowly in the north , this is not possible after the poll values in Berlin .
In both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to face the head of the government .
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
According to the survey , the party would only be close to the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
Third place is controversial between the left and the AfD .
The left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.4 percent ) , the AfD would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country day .
Despite slight losses , the Greens fell again into the Schwerins Landtag , with 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) .
NPD and FDP would not represent 3 percent in the country day .
According to the Berlin Chamber of Deputies , the Poll would only be 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.3 percent ) .
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent .
They were still behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.6 percent ) but before the left at 15 percent ( previously 11.7 percent ) .
The AfD would be represented at the Chamber of Deputies for the first time at 14 percent .
At 5 percent , the FDP could hope for a return that pirates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011 .

Russia and Turkey : An `` alliance of outsiders '' ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to lend their hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions .
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can not deny the impression that Ankara wants that reconciliation most .
There was the handshake , yes .
But Putin 's smile was shy and he barely radiated heat , even for his restrained conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his `` dear friend '' Putin - according to a report entire five times .
I could n't count it anymore .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing had happened .
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
But a Putin-led , sustainable cool showed that Russia 's head of state had forgotten nothing .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was wutting .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back seat .
The crime was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend .
Rebuilding the vetting will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , the state-controlled media conducted a fierce , unrestricted attack on Ankara .
At once , it seemed the Turks were carrying the blame for everything .
Most serious were accusations by senior officials that Erdogan 's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by so-called Islamic State .
He vehemently denied that .
But in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire are clear .
Erdogan primarily needs all friends he can get after he was nearly absent from his office last month in a failed coup .
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - specifically banning charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
The number has fallen by almost 90 % .
In Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume .
They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean .
This week , state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
A report in Vedemosti put it as follows : `` tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , considering its response to attempted power as a weak response .
In addition , the continued groom over the snail 's snails of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey 's relationship with the West - comes to an end .
The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for his support for the elected states after the attempted coup .
This is a natural matter for Moscow , which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change .
The summit in this glorious palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one that an analyst once described to me , `` alliance of outsiders '' : two countries that feel the West and feel badly treated and now allied .
Nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as peacemaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It could be significant that after almost three hours of first-time talks , both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the issue .
The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize them .
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria .
But after months of open hostilities - and , given the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey absent the Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again .

Simone Biles creates gold in the damenturnen
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all that .
Dynamic on the jump horse .
Effortlessly on the beam .
Breathtaking bend on the ground .
All along brilliantly .
And now finally Olympic champion .
The 19-year-old American-born American champion on Thursday became a multi-fight title , widening the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of the headlights of the Olympics .
Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medal winners and `` Final Five '' teams of teams Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina .
American female Simone Biles teaches on the beam beam during the women 's single-amputery in the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and overall , while consolidating her reputation for being the best of her generation , or even at all .
She broke down in tears when her final result was shown and ended her long journey at that moment .
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated her sport the past three years , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said she was `` the best turnaround I 've ever seen . ''
It awaited her last exam in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations .
Not having a handful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment .
Americans Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace each other after they each won gold and silver in the women 's individual multi-combat final in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday while serving as exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi .
Although Biles insisted , during her long path to the top , never planned the future , that 's not really true .
Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical tumbling pass - are tuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
It 's no coincidence .
This girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman 's mother during a school excursion to the gym where Boorman trained , became the force .
She has not lost a multi-fight contest since the summer of 2013 , a victory series that will hold for as long as Biles wants .
Even though Mustafina performed slightly through two turns , the picture drowned .
Beams and ground beams - in which Biles holds the world championship title - laughed .
She resumed again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and put one on the floor with a 15,933 .
Raisman embraced her gently as she awaited her Endergbuch - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles glossy red , white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
Raisman 's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina .
This time , the 22-year-old team captain , named by the Americans , had a lead .
After her ground exercise , she threw kiss hands to the audience , overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful .
As for Biles , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old from early this week has a whole new meaning :

Salzburg `` West Side Story '' with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the `` West Side Story '' with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Julia .
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
A musical conquered Salzburg : the `` West Side Story , '' Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece .
The artistic director , Cecilia Bartoli , wanted to bring the musical into the Temple of Classics and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Maria .
In the orchestra , the Simón Bolívar orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel : `` This music is full of rhythm , '' he swarmed .
We always say that she is very Latin American .
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
It 's a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say we really have Bernstein 's music in our blood !
Bartoli plays an older mary in this staging .
She remembers her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dance .
The role of Maria has always fascinated me .
First because it is musically extraordinary !
And then there would be Maria 's personality .
She says it in her song : `` I feel pretty , oh so beautiful , I feel pretty and witty and bright '' .
So she is wise , obviously naive , and very passionate .
`` It resembles me very much , my Italian character , who I have as a Roman , '' laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It 's such an honor for us to work with her .
She is an immensely generous person .
And Bartoli returns the compliment : `` Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! ''
Conducting is a necessity for him .
You see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it 's his life !
It 's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
We both have a more southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
For American director Philip Wm McKinley , the `` West Side Story '' is highly topical : `` This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism . ''
Today we have the refugees , then the Puertorians went to New York , and the New York residents did n't want them .
These are the same issues , and they are just as meaningful today as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Greenland shark : The oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old
Seldom sight .
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter .
This hai was allowed to return to sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna .
He was born in 1624 and floats well at 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland sharks only get 150 years of offspring .
The Greenland shark is floating along the north Atlantic Ocean , and in an hour it is an average of 1,220 metres .
Only when it arrives will the five-metre-long animal accelerate to sat 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed .
This slowness , however , seems to be a recipe for high age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues , in the journal `` Science , '' at least , report a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old .
`` Madness , '' Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock said in Rostock , which represents a world record for vertebrates .
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected Greenland sharks will be stinged .
Only lacked evidence .
Greenland sharks are hard to watch , eventually living in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually only dive in winter .
Researchers know little about the Greenland sharks lifestyle .
Their timescale pace was somewhat different when they took six animals with a broadcaster before Spitsbergen .
Prey make these sharks anyway : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice ocean and seek carcasses that torkish from higher water layers .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen took from Greenland or Spitsbergen in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as a catch from the north Atlantic .
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long , while the largest was 502 centimetres .
To determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lentil nucleus of the sharks with the carbon -14 method .
This center of the eye lens emerges before the birth of the sharks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed .
The two smallest sharks had remarkably much carbon -14 in lentils .
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempted to put greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
In the 220-centimetre length of the third smallest animal , the lentil core , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon -14 from the nuclear tests , it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 .
All major Greenland sharks , in their lentils , had normal carbon -14 quantities , created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
In fact , the carbon -14 watch for a 493-centimetre long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 , while the record hai was expected to be 392 years old at 502 centimetres .
Greenlandhai females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres , it was known .
Now the researchers of length were able to assign an age .
Since one of the animals was probably at the threshold of gender maturity at 392 centimetres , and its age was 156 years old , Greenland sharks can clearly be at least one and a half centuries old with the propagation .
This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates .
It is not a coincidence that such methusaleme lives mainly in icy waters .
Even the previous record holder , a 211-year-old Greenland whale , in whose bacon a 120-year-old Hardenenspitze stecked , was trapped before Alaska .
Due to low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there is often also running on flame .
So they mature later - and ageing slowly .
In order to warm up in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram of elephant .
Another advantage : They have fewer enemies .
`` A smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible , '' explained evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein .
A very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet : 20 years ago Nokia Communicator entered the market .
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iphone 5 .
It was thicker and bigger , so it was not good .
On the contrary , it was pretty big .
The built-in memory initially was eight megabytes , which would now be for roughly two selfies with high resolution .
An iphone is now being delivered with at least 16 gigabytes .
The `` Nokia 9000 communicator '' came into the shops exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone .
For a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
Twenty years ago , however , the communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an `` office in the western pocket format . ''
In fact , the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even via fax was reachable by communicator .
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers , albeit agonically slow .
A calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be sounded like a laptop .
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen .
The price was very proud : 2700 Deutschmark , i.e . around 1400 Euros .
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
No one could see in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
Since then , everything has been different .
The smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
The Finns cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft .
The market today dominates operators , all of whom came much later than Nokia .
Anytime and everywhere online , this is today for a very many people .
In 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
Some 1.4 billion devices were sold , and Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million pieces .
Global sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros .
This includes the well-run business of countless app operators and telecommunications companies .
A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market only came in early 2007 , then Apple chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones at Mac World .
He promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communicator to ease everything by touch screen .
Apple 's victory began , even today the iphone is the group 's most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , which dominated the market , had the aftertaste .
They eventually vanished , Blackberry has to fight .
Sawing now has Apple and Asian operators like Samsung .
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
On average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
`` We must all learn to put the smartphone away , '' said Janina Kugel , the Siemens Board for Staff .
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .

North oil workers resume talks , suspend strike
Labor struggles over pay for north sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties to the dispute are set to table a new round of talks , negotiators said .
Strikes against oil field service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
`` Wood Group , as well as the Unite and RMT unions , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , '' said a joint statement .
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next few weeks , which will begin early next year to address the problems .
The unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group this year cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
The company 's rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014 .
The company said additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn .
Shell has dismissed for its part thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega merger with UK energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation exacerbated by Britain 's decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest job disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation .
The North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
`` In the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for few , '' he said in a statement .
In 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years .

More than just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of U.S. Vogue .
Kendall , who is Estee Lauder 's brand embassy and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday .
`` In a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to the wine , '' Kendall wrote .
The cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians ? ) , crippled reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family ( with the exception of problems Rob and Caitlyn , and in the presence of the all-popular Showbiz-onkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) , as they forget their sister 's cover and that ends with a classic twist : they have all planned a surprise party .
This represents the cliché-filled plot of almost every birthday episode of a children 's broadcast ( Seacrest brought the phrase , `` You rooftop , that we would have forgotten you ? , '' with the honesty of a drawing rabbit on a broadcast pitch at 8 a.m. ) , but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity .
With regard to the September issue of Vogue , a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun .
Kendall 's big sister Kim may have beaten her in the Vogue cover ( she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
The September issue is the most selling edition of the year for Vogue .
With a volume more likely to resemble a picture tape than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( according to Fashion Ista , from the 832 pages of the Roller 's 615 pages advertising ) .
The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years , images of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement .
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In recent years , clearly more `` celebrities , the modules , '' were `` models that are celebrities '' on the cover .
Oscar prize winner and Dior brand embassy Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady Gaga had the honour .
But even at the low chance that Ms Jenner - described by the magazine as the `` breakthrough model '' of her generation - falls below the previous category , she is in good company .
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good snapchat video ( even though it is all about Jenner ) .
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade .
Of course , Jenner 's success does n't like everyone .
With her reality TV story , Jenner 's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense .
In June , the former Victoria 's Secret model criticized Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid , calling them `` the mist pieces of the moment . ''
These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with Jenner 's appearance on the Vogue cover .
But to get around the missminess seems to be passing by .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue .
It is , literally , a supermodel .
She runs for Marc Jacobs .
It makes advertising for your grunting of Estee Lauder .
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps .
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to the magazine LOVE .
And in her spare time she is seen in reality TV , presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children .

Mahaj Brown , 6 , `` cleared of bullets , '' survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week , the second time a 6-year-old child is being shot .
The boys ' grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown .
The grandparents said Brown suffered several shooting injuries including in the end , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in hospital when he was transported .
`` He has gone through a lot , his small body has been cleared of bullets , '' his grandmother Delores Melendez told the broadcaster .
I just ca n't believe that .
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries .
The boys ' family told the broadcaster he expected to be regendered .
He should have started first class at a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people shot in German town .
Three men were also shot : two aged 29 and a 32-year-old .
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition , according to CBS Philadelphia .
The boy was found lying up on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old , who is in a critical condition , reported the broadcaster .
The other two victims were not in the car and police were just determining whether to find themselves among one of the injured men of the offender .
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it apparently came to a crossfire between several shooters .
Cartridge sleeves for storm rifles , traced to various storm rifles , oversailed the Tatort .
It seems that this is clearly an ongoing battle .
On the road , on both sides of the walk , hung hulls .
So there appear to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved , '' police haul pman Anthony Ginaldi told the broadcaster in Philadelphia .
Several houses and vehicles have also been hit in the area .
No arrests have occurred and police are currently investigating the surveillance video .
On Tuesday , another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross blaze at the arm as she played in front of her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect .

Tourists in Portugal panic after a low-flying military jet overflies
Sun worshippers in Aveiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion air force P-3C plane put an incredible crash
The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no security risk
This was the moment that altered tourists began to panic after a low-flying jet crashed down a full beach .
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost within a tangible distance above the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal .
Holidaymakers spranked up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what came through the clouds .
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic Fly-By on social media , said : `` It really flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing down . ''
Nuno Arroja added : `` I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . ''
Tourists at Aveiro beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese air force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to detect them .
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby land fires , but the air force insisted the safety was at no time at risk .
Land fires this summer destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people were also killed on the island of Madeira .
The Portuguese air force today admitted that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

In bomb attack : He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others : Khaled Omar .
He was the hero of Aleppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
He risked everything to save others .
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a facial bomb attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the White Helmets , a civil protection group that , according to Bild newspaper , saved nearly 60,000 people .
2900 volunteers are putting their own lives at risk to pull people out of crushed homes and provide first aid in the war zone .
They are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : A video of the civil servant showing him at an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
It made the Syrians the luminous symbol character in the horror of war .
As a hero , however , he never saw himself , said according to Bild : `` For me that 's the real jihad . ''
`` When I die from saving lives , I think God sees a martyr in me . ''
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria .
The helicopters have thrown four facial bombs over the Alzadia district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
A woman and two children died , seven people suffering from breathing difficulties .
`` We are now removing the poisonous remnants of the bomb so that children do n't play with it , '' the image quotes his final words before he died .
The Assad regime 's deadly bomb had to hit terrorists .

Who builds Braunschweig 's cheap apartments ?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors should be much more accountable in the future .
How to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes over the next few years ?
The SPD proposes an `` action plan '' for the next council meeting .
But dispute is programmed .
First and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap housing ?
A regulation is missing .
SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann said : `` We agree with the Greens : those who want to build on urban land will have to expel 20 percent of all homes as social housing in future . ''
However , cheap apartments can also be created in stock .
However , the big point of contention at town hall is , said Bratmann : `` How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? ''
`` We want investors on such land to build at least 10 percent but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . ''
A new urban housing support program , which will cost millions and still needs to be funded , should provide incentives .
The problem , Bratmann said : `` There is currently no agreement between the groups . ''
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
The left still wants tough conditions for investors .
Regardless , Bratmann said , a tightening of the situation in the housing market is emerging .
If the action concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration .
More staff are needed .
It is unclear if we will get the skilled workers .
However , the programme is not yet complete : for the approximately 1260 new homes that should be built anyway .
But how do we compare the loss of some 1300 cheap homes , which will be phased out over the next few years ?
By 2020 alone , there will be 500 homes .
To prevent that , planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm said , should now be purchased from the city .
In addition , consideration should be given to getting housing back into price fixing .
This is possible in the West City .
The problem could be solved at a stroke .
Because in the West City , deadlines expire at the end of the year .
Around 1800 homes could be picked up there in price fixing for cheap apartments .
Only : the owners , the housing companies , do not want that .
Because the number of social housing in the West City is once again drastically increased , away from the goal of so-called through-mix .
There should no longer be a concentration of the socially vulnerable in only a few districts .
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says : `` For a broad majority , the CDU must be on the boat . ''
That has focused on more building sites for single-family homes .
But that does not mean that a compromise can not be found .

Municipal law centres 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most needy of the country are dismissed annually by the community law centres , while the industry is on the impact of further cuts in funds on already overloaded transactions .
In Queensland , three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogulation and similar - are already being dismissed in their requests for free legal advice and legal assistance .
Legal services of the community , which are already overly busy , are ready for further cuts .
From June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
Queesland Municipal Centre director James Farrell said the last survey by the National Association of Community Law Centres found that thousands of people are already being dismissed every year .
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without repealing the federal government 's decision .
`` Queensland community law centres are chronically underfunded , meaning thousands of people are dismissed from important services you need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relationships , people with unmanageable and exaggerating debts , families who go through separation , workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems legal and this survey shows they ca n't get the help they need .
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
We call on the federal attorney general and federal justice minister , as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis , to repeal these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in legal problems .
Last year the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
Now is the time to look at the needs of community law centres and their communities , and that the Palaszczuk government invest in this important work .

Asocial family destroyed before delogulation of social housing in Saltash , Cornwall
An asocial family left her social flat after a delogit with a £50,000 damage because she terrorised her neighbours .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their estate in Saltash , Cornwall , after a long list of complaints .
After being forcibly removed from their estate , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in a irreparable condition .
The walls pointed out crushing holes , wooden walkways were rounded up , rubbish was strewn on the floor and graffiti was leaked to the walls .
The family were relocated and it is believed she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy , who works for house management at Cornwall Housing , said she fears the apartment will no longer be repaired .
She said : `` It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people do n't have to live in that way .
There are many things to consider because this estate will presumably be considered as not such a beautiful part of Cornwall .
The family is notorious and their reputation is too .
The couple had three sons , who meanwhile lived in the flat and police said the terror the family inflicted on them was street fights with baseball sleepers , intimidation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive cries , disputes and curses .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an injunction for anti-social behaviour in June .
In some rooms of the house that may be demolished , old rubbish was found
In the estate where drugs have been traded in the past , the wooden diets were spotted
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to regularly call the police
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner violently from the estate this week after giving them a longer period of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out .
Delogulation was cheered by facilitated neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
One said : `` They did n't care about anyone . ''
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
`` This morning we could n't sleep . ''
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we were n't used to it !
Now that they are finally away , it will be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , the Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities .
The family lived for 20 years in the house where police were called at regular intervals
Rubbish and old toys were dumped down on the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added : `` It 's a shame that the tenant declined to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , because delogulation is always the last step considering Cornwall Housing .
This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terribly seen for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that has been done by my team , the Devon and Cornwall police , and members of the community , who have courageously entered us and have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will donate consolation to some neighbours , conveying the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived at different times at the house , but that they were all over 20 .
A dirty mattress left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogening on the floor
House management workers will now have to clean away rubbish mountains that surround the house
In 2014 , police carried out a Razzia in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and cash of £1,700 .
Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug in commercial intent .
She claimed the money was for a tombstone of her son , Lee Skeldon , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
After they were without homeless , it is believed Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
Many room walls of the house were lined with graffiti .
Police say she will delogulate tenants who do n't stick to house order
Angela Crow , from Devon and Cornwall police , said delogulation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do n't stick to the house order .
`` This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusations as well as those who have been victimized by such behaviour , '' she said .
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizing .
She is also a social worker on the ground .
Since July , Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach .
The social pedagogist supports the management team of Achim Grockenberger .
It sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Regine customer from the working circle suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there , the egg legend Wollmilfsau , which has a problem above all else .
Thus , some - rather than the number of tasks required - had intended to be targeted when the administration wanted to tender .
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people , coupled with years of experience in the field of social work , has just been joined by an egg legend Wollmilfsau .
But administrative work is not their central area , says Annika Deuschle .
Above all , it is about organizing , working with people on the ground , and also behind the scenes and networking activity .
The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks .
It has limited a 50 percent job to three years .
`` It was high time , '' Regine customer says , adding that Annika Deuschle supports honor and key players .
There are big and small problems , organisational , human and understanding problems .
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised .
Local authorities are responsible for the accommodation .
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms .
The costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by municipalities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the Land Council to the Commune and Jobcentre .
Problem : There are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
The search has been shaping up as very difficult for some time .
In fact , the administration does not find private homes .
It does not work so far , it is reliant on private housing , said Deuschle .
Therefore , community housing must be humiliated , as is so beautiful .
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße .
But only apartments are not done .
The perspective is the keyword , Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a firm stay , there are internships , training places , school places , one-euro jobs and help for refugees and migrants who need to be fired or set up .
`` More places would be good , '' Regine customer reported .
Many work in the Bauhof or help house masters , do nonprofit work - and that 's motivated and very decent , as Annika Deuschle reports .
It hopes that work for the community will lead to positive visibility .
This is `` no employment therapy . ''
But activity does not mean work .
The day needs a firm structure , say Deuschle and customer .
People would have to develop a sense of belonging .
So it needs offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
Professional courses are rar .
So here too , administration and volunteers jump .
It is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
The long duration of the procedures is a problem .
They must explain to the refugees that it is just taking place and that they can make good use of the time , for example with language courses .
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach can not work and is pointless , never integrate .
The clear majority is motivated .
But there are also problems , says customers honestly , `` people where nothing goes '' , the work of Deuschle and customers is always to motivate others .
All this is already a `` mammoth task . ''
A difficult question : Do the two fear radicalisation after recent incidents , even in a small community like Urbach ?
`` No , '' Regine customer says quite clearly , `` which some might call naïve , '' a residual risk , but does not want to exclude it .
But the helpers are already aware .
These incidents are also subject to the refugees .
They would fear that the assassins will bring them into disrepute .
`` They want to show that they have nothing to do with that , '' Regine customer says .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
So , major and volunteer volunteers must look for activities on the ground and in the region .
They always have the background that a new bumper to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach .
Does Germany need a cap ?
To answer this question clearly is the policy .
It is actually unfair to put them on the ground .
`` In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want , '' says Annika Deuschle .
No new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the past people .
There are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
But if people are in need , they need to help them , both women agree .
The political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .

B27 refurbishment : Restaurants suffer closure
There is nothing to mess with the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated .
There is always praise for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.30 a.m. and only end at around 20 p.m .
`` They made everything pretty crunchy , '' says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet petrol station .
It 's a super team .
Nor is there any delay .
The construction site could be moved to the south at half-time at half-time , and everything should be finished by the end of October .
The compensation of those responsible for the construction work will also be praised , for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary occupations .
Since the construction site moved south on Monday , and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted , and the connection to Rottenburg has also been restored , the traffic situation within the location has been relaxed .
The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen to the B 27 again .
The traffic through the place seems to be going back .
`` There were some significant complaints in some cases , '' says deputy chief executive , Florian King , responsible for the transportation management management .
The residents of Bachelierstrasse , Steinlaughstrasse , Hafnerstrasse and Weiherrain were struggling with more traffic noise because many surreptitious routes were searched and more familiar to their Navi than the signposting .
This resulted in some lorries being franked in residential areas .
As speed limits were also not met , the municipality demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen .
`` There have been significant overruns , '' says King , who made himself aware of the situation on the ground .
Two to three a minute have already passed .
The quickest was travelling at 77-hour kilometres in the Tempo -30 zone .
Since the construction site moved on , it has become more quiet .
For business people at the B 27 , it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again .
Businesses can not look into the cards .
But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales blows in them leaves everyone wondering .
However , some more and some are less affected .
Those who have less to do with `` end customers '' , so for other companies , have little impact .
Even at the Maier car house , Thomas Sulz talks of a `` at most slight decline '' but also acknowledges that of course `` the runner-up is missing . ''
The most heavily battered are the locals along the road .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the Steakhouse , formerly crown , finds clear words .
This is already existential .
Not only him , but all restaurants have `` hit hard . ''
The customers were missing from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil .
We must be happy with every euro turnover .
He cites the losses as `` well over 50 percent . ''
The road refurbishment had `` thrown back at two years . ''
Half of his employees have had to dismiss him .
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would have reacted differently .
Instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation , with the reference that the restaurant of professional animals otherwise of the benefits of the situation on the B 27 , must also bear in mind the disadvantages caused by the refurbishment .
Göhner knows from other districts where so much more generous was handled .
In all cases , Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
After all , the family business has been here since 1715 , he points out the long history .
The fact that other regular guests are now seeing less frequently due to the complicated traffic management can be understood .
If you ca n't drive , it 's beautiful elsewhere .
Göhner has no doubts that his regular clientele will come back after the restoration work .
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza , Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history .
Six months of construction work , that is already brutal .

Errest Night : tips against sleep deprivation
In the evening , you get around eternally , you lie awake for hours , in the morning you will not think of sleep well before the alarm clock .
It 's anything but relaxing .
After all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep is often or permanently unrecoverable .
How do sleep problems or sleep problems arise ?
There are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can be based on various causes , emphasised Hans-Günter Wekam , board member of the German Society for sleep research and sleep medicine .
What one understands , however , is the Insomnie , i.e . a disorder and sleep disorder .
In particular , many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagenknecht , board member at the German House of Homeopathy with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel .
What is behind sleep deprivation ?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex .
Organic , psychological or behavioral factors can be found , but also medications .
Not rarely is sleep disorder expressions of another disorder .
`` Very early waking up is often common in a depression , '' Wekam says .
And it may be that different factors are interdependent .
For example , anyone who has a tape disc can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and perhaps start to greet about everyday problems and concerns , weaving one example .
This leads to claims , and sleep is no longer possible .
When should sleep deprivation become a doctor ?
Whoever does not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on a day should go to the doctor , wecht .
The impairment can look very different : you have been cut off , tired , unlucky , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily zipped , has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
To alleviate sleep disorder , it is important to find out the causes .
As treatment options come , among other things , behavioral changes , cognitive behavioral therapy or even medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Lower-skilled sleepers are barely available in Germany , emphasised Prof Ingo Fietze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité University 's medical medicine Berlin .
Therefore , when sleeping problems , you should first contact the doctor , wether .
It can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
For example , for the study in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise for example snorkelling with respiratory exchangers , for sick day fatigue , for sleeping mammals or if you do n't find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fietze explained .
It is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
You should spend the day normally .
`` Just please do n't make lunch , '' Fietze says .
After the cordon , you go to bed at his normal time .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , one wears a nose glasses , a chest belt and a finger at the finger .
In addition , a camera on the ceiling features sleeping sleeping .
How can those affected get to grips with the problems ?
There are quite a lot of pitches where you can start to sleep better .
Weather counts : Regular sleeping and starting , not lying in bed for too long , not sleeping on the day , not watching TV , watching alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start immediately reckoning , and that 's completely not conducive .

Putin Putin fixes chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff , Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov has been part of Russia 's closest confidence circle for many years .
The 63-year-old was appointed special envoy for environmental and transportation affairs .
In an opinion of the Kremlin , it is that Putin , without giving reasons , `` ordered Ivanov 's dismissal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . ''
Anton Vaino , who has been Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
On the Kremlin 's website , it says ( in Russian ) that he was later protocol chief and chief of staff of government personnel .
Asked about his appointment , he said to Putin : `` Thank you for your confidence . ''
I think it is the government 's most important task to support your job as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
Surely the smiling faces ?
This move has made Moscow secret .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin 's closest confidances and works as he does for the Soviet Secret Service , the KGB .
As chief of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
At a meeting with President Putin , who aired on television , both men claimed the chief of staff resigned at their own request .
But despite the smile for the cameras , few here are convinced - especially now , just before the general election .
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
Nobody knows that at the moment .
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president wants to guide Russian environmental policy at once - came up with great scepticism .
In his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Kremlin 's website , Ivanov said `` it is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - for four years .
As it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov took the post in December 2011 .
Previously , he was deputy prime minister and defence minister .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the KGB state security service .
In the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , which replaced the KGB , Ivanov was appointed to his deputy .
When Putin came to power , he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most .
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin 's second term , as a third term Putin 's term would have violated the constitution .
But this post was taken by another nearby ally , Putin 's , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later .

Despite doping : these athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for doping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio .
Other overhead athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting medals in Rio .
Doping still determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics .
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa , who had endured her starting right just before the Games , was mercilessly exhausted and boosted at her start ( 100 metres of breast ) .
There was a scurry scene : with a laid-out smile she was still strolling into the hall and had provoked with her appearance .
When she realised she was n't going to pick gold , the audience broke into a jubilant storm .
But there are still many other athletes who go to the start despite doping past at the Rio Olympics .
Here is an overview :
Justin Gatlin ( 100 , 200 , 4x100-m-Staffel / USA ) : The 34-year-old is among the most controversial figures in lightweight athletics .
He was already locked two times for doping ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
Since his bann , the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion runs even faster than before , he is over 100m in 9.80 seconds the world 's number one and is considered the biggest challenger to Usain Bolt .
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce ( 100 , 4x100-m-Staffel / Jamaica ) : The two-time Olympic champion and seven-times world champion had to sit off a six-month lock in 2010 after she was shown the intake of the painkiller oxycodon .
She had strong dental pain after surgery , defying the 29-year-old .
Sandra Perkovic ( discussion / Croatia ) : In 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion and European champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methylamine from 2010 to 2016 .
Perkovic disputed the knowledgeable intake and was locked for six months .
The four widest litters this year go to the account of the big gold favorite .
LaShawn Merritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x400-m-Staffel / USA ) : The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400m , tested positive in 2010 and closed 21 months .
A means of penis enlargement was responsible , Merritt stressed .
This year , the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400m the world 's fastest man .
Iwan Tichon ( Hammerwurn , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athlete has been deterred by so many medals .
For example , Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after testosterone doping was found at him .
The now 40-year-old also had to make Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the 2006 EM title for testosterone abuse .
He received the also-known bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , due to a ruling by the International Sports Court of CAS .
At 80.04 metres , he ranks second in the world rankings .
Liu Hong ( 20 km , China ) : The world class and gold favourite was tested positive only in May , but still allowed to start in Rio .
In the 29-year-old world champion , references were made to the intake of a banned food supplement , the World Anti-Doping Agency , WADA , fell mildly and was already running on 13 July .

Snapchat `` Anime '' effect criticised as Asian caricature
Snapchat says this filter is animme-inspired , but some observers say it 's insensitive to breeds .
With its filter tool , Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are unblemished , proprietary tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day .
All wrongdoing reaches the public .
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused that the app Blackface would promote promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
When this week , some users suggested a filter that gave them slot eyes , false teeth and dark cheeks , some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - `` yellow face . ''
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
The news and outrage were widely shared on Wednesday , with reports from The Verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat announced it had deactivated the feature .
The company offered an apology : the filter was meant as an homage to anime characters rather than a caricature of Asians .
But outsiders who experienced raisin reminded the filter of violating clichés .
Others strongly opposed the animal 's comparison .
In an email , Grace Sparapani , a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely shared over the photos , wrote that the filter was `` injurious and to say the least uncomfortable . ''
She added that `` it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very resounding Asian caricature and filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not clear , but that the yellow face has been drawn into the devaluing extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire .
American culture seems to be implicated in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
And snapchat large audiences of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts - might more likely expect sensitivity .
When one of Snapchat 's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , `` so it 's much harder that such things go unnoticed than it used to be , '' 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , opted to delete her snapchat account , urged others to do the same .
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview , she said she believes racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the largely white , only male leadership , and ended her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
`` Either they do n't have a diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so they can make such decisions , '' said the Chinese-American Zhu , `` or they have people with other skin colours that work there but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it . ''
Others share their opinion , a complaint Snapchat largely unanswered .
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a staff person focused on under-represented populations and internal integration efforts .
For her part , Zhu said she will let her snapchat account shut down , adding , `` I wonder if they need more users like us to say that 's not O.K . ''

Soprano Anna Netrebko openly walks with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents : `` You must have the courage to talk about it . ''
`` Medicine has made great progress , '' said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper `` Corriere della Sera . ''
When the disease was detected by her son , she believed she had to die .
The now eight-year-old Tiago , however , has come forward well and now runs private in New York , where there are the best therapists .
`` To give an example : When I ask him something two years back when I sang at the Milan Scala , he remembers nothing , '' Netrebko said .
But he is the happiest person on earth .
Tiago comes from Netrebko 's connection with Bassbariton Erwin Schrott .
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov .

One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans .
It sounds pretty overloaded , but the HR-V , built on the same new platform as the new Jazz , is actually proving extremely flexible in everyday life .
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high , passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at any point .
The materials of the interior are well processed and pleasant , but only the cockpit side falls down there .
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
Not only is there a boot of 453 l at high and 1026l in folded backrest , but there are the `` Magic Seats '' .
This is less magical than it sounds : the back benches of the back bench can be flapping like a cinema chair , and thus offer storage space that is 1.24m high from floor to ceiling .
The boot can be loaded well , but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
He should , however , carry out his work quietly .
The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
There 's another motorisation : a 1.5-l gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp .
All-wheel drive is not offered .
Driving is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
But the steering should be a bit more direct .
The equipment leaves no wishes open in the tested top variant `` executive '' .
Security systems include the City emergency brake wizard ( working up to Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the track keeping assistant .
The collision Warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as `` approaching objects '' when ranking .
The remote light assistant works very reliably .
And the intelligent speed controller reacts to traffic signs and drops the speed when required .
However , full connectivity exists only for top equipment : 7-inch touchscreen , Navi , app integration and more .
Two USB and HDMI connectors are under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome .
The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine .
Those who do n't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros , the diesel from 23,000 euros .
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard .
Honda offers a versatile and everyday car with the HR-V .

Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt 's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association functionaries , but 58 percent of the 33,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him .
In July , Hunt had unveiled plans to introduce the contract forcefully and said the NHS would be in a `` niemandsland '' and any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients .
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unreasonable times .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the chairwoman of the BMA Committees for Assistant Physicians , shared last night in a notice : `` Assistant doctors have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and manage to treat all doctors fairly . ''
With only eight weeks remaining , until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out .
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes caused by conversations with the government were reluctant to participate and sometimes to ear-numbing silence .
That 's what happened to the promise Jeremy Hunt made only last month that his door would always be offensive .
`` Jeremy Hunt must act now , lift up the force and address the concerns of assistant doctors . ''
If he fails to do so , assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further labour combat measures .
The last strike in late April saw an uptick of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , as nurses and specialist doctors were included to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association .
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54.000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , director general of NHS staff , urged assistant doctors to end the strike .
Mortimer said : `` Labor combat measures achieve nothing of only little , but already burden overburdened teams and service providers , and only prepare the patients , carers and their families for concerns , distress and disruption . ''
Over the last two months , we have spoken to the Assistant doctors ' committee and have responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries .
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , extra training for those returning from a professional period , training centres , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays , and the gender pay gap - were a sign of how serious it was for the employers , Health Education England and the Department of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November , February and May .

England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London , but across the country .
For me , that represented the biggest Heathrows attraction , just as it was in London in 2012 , when we ran a great effort to ensure all our nations and regions benefited from the Games .
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End .
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow .
For our local communities , we will alone create 10,000 new apprenticeships , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
Just as they were ahead of us at London 2012 , there will be those who think the challenge of expanding HeathRows is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage .
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcoming , but Heathrow answers every question put to him .
Like the Olympics , Heathrow is for many , not individual , infrastructure projects .
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £211 billion of long-term growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of GB .
We have a great team at Heathrow , which has implemented a £11bn expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - which was elected to the world 's best airport terminal five years in a row - to the T2 , which was built amid the world 's two most frequented careers .
Now they are ready to provide a third catwalk , supported by £16 billion in private investment .
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skill and employment that England can be proud of .
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury

Future of Portland 's melting plant questionable due to lifting energy contract
The future of Portland 's aluminum melting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - is at stake as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts as the energy company supplied .
The move followed the government 's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies to operate the facility .
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November .
Up to 2000 jobs at Alco 's facility in Portland are at stake .
No fewer than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk when closing .
In addition , domino effects could come as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of Victoria 's total electricity generation .
In 2014 Alcoa closed Point Henry Smelzerei , which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alco 's melting plant in Portland is losing money and risks closure .
This move follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the price of electricity for the plant .
AGL , which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley , said it expects three more owners to cancel their contracts .
The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina , which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares .
`` AGL expects the plant to continue operating in Portland , which will mean further physical demand for electricity through melting , '' the company said .
AGL also said the contracts were so-called `` backup operations , '' which should have come into force from November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017 .
`` That is why AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17 , '' the electricity supplier said .
All potential impacts on the revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong wholesale electricity prices .
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual instalment of $ 187 million in `` anticipation of termination . ''
Alcoa said the decision to book the contracts does not affect the `` Alcoa 's ability ... to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant . ''
The U.S. company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which should have come into effect from November this year , even though there is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract .
Analysts warn of the industry 's poor economic circumstances ahead of the possible closure of Portland melzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle .
In reference to the analysts ' statements earlier in the week , head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumed around 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity annually .
If both plants disappear from the market , that would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [ electricity market ] .
And for us as a generator , that would not be good , '' he said .

Hurt - man stabbs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked and seriously injured his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife .
As police announced yesterday , the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
Instead , the alcoholic offender smashed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend .
When this came into the apartment , he stole twice .
The 44-year-old was injured at the hand and the body .
Police were able to arrest the offender .
While the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend , he called his mother .
He then alerted his sister .
Together with her life companion , the 45-year-old wanted to calm down her brother .
But she could n't persuade him to leave the apartment .
That 's why she was out of the house with her life companion .
On the street , they met the man 's ex-life companion .
When the two women stabbed the flat again , the 50-year-old sat down his sister and attacked his ex-girlfriend .

Old buildings , a few lindenages , interbetween still a remnant pavement : The Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like that at first glance , but police count it among the city 's `` dangerous places . ''
If you walk down the street from east to west , you will get past playgrounds , a freshened nursery and a biolade .
To the façade of a grey house , someone sprayed `` ugly ! ''
Compared with a Lidl that will soon be demolished , it is already being built : a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be created by 2017 here .
However , articles about this `` trendy district , '' as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls it , are being given preferential treatment in recent weeks .
The reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents have rental contracts , but the ground floor still occupies rooms and is used for events .
In particular , the Berlin interior senator , Henkel , had spoken out several times since the beginning of the year in favour of a tough police action against the project , describing the area as a `` no-go zone '' for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
After June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Cadterschmiede , with 300 police officers , were patrolled by police for three weeks , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on the ground , blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors entering the home with number 94 .
Meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners .
On July 13 , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents .
On this summer afternoon , the street acts peacefully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun , others entertain themselves in front of spawn .
A primary school and kindergartens are located close to the house projects .
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in the Kiev since 1999 , and Jana * , who dragged three children here , are mainly from the police presence .
With the residents of the house projects , they share concerns about rising rents and gentrification .
It does not sound like a Kiev , which majority of the police protection from vandalating left .
The trench that the Berlin interior senator and police make up between homeowners and their neighbours so apparently does not exist .
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional worker district , which even today has low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city .
House occupations and the home-made projects have also long been part of the Kiev : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainzer road near the Rigaer .
While the Mainz had been cleared in a real street raid , many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and are still inhabited today by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
At the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and election Berliners from all over the world : now residents from DDR times and former housekeepers are sharing their Kiev .
This is also noticeable in rents , which have risen by almost 60 percent in new rents since 2009 .
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development : they are detained on sliced discs or freshly coated facades , which were thrown with colour bags .
No other road was so often mentioned this year along with the words `` left-wing violence . ''
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as the violation of bodies are almost exclusively against policemen .
Most of the offences are made up of material damage , which tend to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
As for acts of violence , it is appealing : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , who certainly have not been .
Even the famous burning cars will no longer exist directly in the Rigaer .
For the architect , their street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : `` Here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere '' .
Neugebauer deliberately moved to Rigaer Strasse - and stayed .
That is why it was also so important for the residents to get their streets back : from the police , the politics and the media , all of them suddenly claiming sovereignty over the district in July .
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer , the street continues to be taken away from them : through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that squeeze the old residents .
`` These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well beguiling , '' she says .
`` I absolutely can not approve of violence and destruction . ''
But what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
There is frustration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for Zugezon , who annoys himself over colour bombs , and the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev .
Anyone who draws should be aware of it - just like someone pulling into a pub neighborhood can complain badly about noise there .
All persons presented only with names have asked not to be named with their right name

Hurriedly rains , flooding gives cause for bailout in Louisiana , Mississippi
Hurried rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday , with more rains expected throughout Saturday .
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains , the National Weather Service reported .
Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the Governor 's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , said the requests were for flood vehicles , boats and sandbags .
Steele said the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sandbags alone .
A flood warning system will be deployed across large parts of south Louisiana until Saturday .
The weather service said that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in the area .
A flood early warning system was set up in south Alabamas on Friday , while mobile continues to rage .
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs , which are both located in Louisiana , will all likely reach record levels over the weekend .
Metereologist Alek Kraut says both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge .
He also said a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger , as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas over the faithful rivers .
The River Tickfaw , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.00 on Friday .
Rescue teams still burst people from floodwater in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and his wife were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday .
Hansford , 62 , says water from Beaver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet from his home , has risen sharply overnight .
He said he had warned another Stefsohn who lives nearby .
`` We woke up and the water streamed and flooded in , '' said Hansford .
It reached my waist .
His wife said Hansford had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one to swim .
Hansford said Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster , where they were housed until Friday .
Kraut said the flood had `` spread rapidly '' as there continued to be heavy rains and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions .
According to Krauthann , an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain .
Krauthmann said the ground had been significantly full-throated by the rains since Wednesday .
Authorities said heavy rains and roadblocks caused residents to rescue residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching outages in five school districts .
The CBS subsidiary , WWL , reported that a beige ordered in Tangipahoa had 200 flooded houses .
Residents were evacuated in two churches , which were now both flooded .
The commune of the community Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by flood waters .
Emergency shelters have been set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuees .
`` Once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , '' he said .
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags for the residents hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
`` The last big flood we had was in March , '' said Lacy Landrum of the city government .
This seems to be a similar incident .
In Mississipp , emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County 's emergency manager said it continued to rage on the Gulf Coast .
According to his details , a handful of houses are reported to have been flooded on Thursday , but none have been reported on Friday .
Keith Townson , manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
`` I 've seen water in places I 've never seen before , '' Townson said , `` and it 's still coming . ''

Rio 2016 : Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internethit
Not always do Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics .
This shows the brave performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
At the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images .
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
On social networks , Habte subsequently became a viral internethit .
In fact , the 24-year-old finished his lead with a backlog of 48 seconds and finished 59 in 59 .
It was rather his not-exactly-sporty figure , who drew the attention of international media .
Why the 24-year-old still attends the Olympics ?
The Ethiopians got a special start right from the international swimming association .
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more familiar .
Since most athletes are running in aethopia , Habte simply wanted to do something different .
Preparation is everything : Robel Kiros Habte makes himself ready for the big race .
quickly , the first nicknames made the round .
Some media described him as a `` robel of the whale . ''
In line with a `` prosperity belly , '' the English tabloid `` The Sun '' made fun of him with `` Dad Bod . ''
His time , he only beat with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter free style , played no part .
Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn .
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics , Eric Moussambani 's run ensured media attention .
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea when he had to enter over 100 metres of free style on his own .
Frenchman was fired at the time .
The then 22-year-old only learned about eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the match .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with trainer 's cancer to rowing victory
There will be no more emotinous gold than in these games and that wants what .
From the first rowing blow to the last , 220 hard Hieve , which went into history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa .
Even though it was only those who sat at the ruder , there were three voices in the boat , the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all-present as they ruined the second Olympic gold in the second without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport to set such a benchmark .
Her dominance was absolute , even her 39.unadulterated bet , which is also unprecedented .
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
Behind every gold in rowing , a battalion is set up by willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and it was no-one more comfortable than the coach who did n't know 30 months ago whether he would survive that day when cancer was diagnosed with him .
As he said , he was risky .
I had bladder cancer that is operational and that 's what they did .
If you do n't do that , he spreads everywhere .
It would have been a pretty bad situation .
It changes a little bit .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio were lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014 , outside the season , which kept the disruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice .
That 's how it starts .
Rurowing in itself is already a challenge , but it makes it even bigger .
In the immediacy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
Stanning , who was a principal at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said `` I was an emotional wreck this week , maybe something extremely extreme , but it means so much . ''
It just repeats how much I mean how much I and Helen and Robin have worked .
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him , he is the best coach in the world .
I could n't have liked a better person to train or a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years .
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents could n't match .
Even in the last 500 metres , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were trapped very much at the moment .
Helen called `` stay in the process , stay in the process . ''
It 's really important not to let yourself go .
We had a good start and at the same time we were n't looking to make something .
We did n't want a fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did too .
The pair will take a time off for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glover will have to appear at a wedding next week , her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshalle .
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did n't want to say that was my last race .
That would have meant too much pressure .
In London , it took around six months to realise I 'm an Olympic champion .
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
Here it took about four minutes .
That feels so much better , '' she said .

Clinton 's and Trump 's economic policy by comparison : It 's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade deal TTP - that 's what both Clinton and Trump want .
The two U.S. Presidential candidates , however , are divided on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue .
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lie in a fundamental , rather philosophical , difference .
The , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small , warning how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
He himself would be quite different , Trump claimed .
He will massively back regulations , and he is pushing for wide tax reform at lower rates - for private people and for companies .
Clinton , on the other hand , says the state has certain tasks to perform , it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money for it .
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich , she says .
Interestingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
Investing in that , Trump and Clinton say almost word equal .
The Democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical teaparty wing of Republicans .
So there could still be intra-party discussions on Trump .
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-run coal production in the United States .
Oil extraction should also be possible in protected areas , the Paris climate change agreement wants to cancel .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand Renewable Energies with her investment program , calling for `` a country to become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs . ''
`` It will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . ''
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
TPP , the Trans-Pacific Partnership , both do n't want to sign .
At the same time , however , both do not want to isolate the USA from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs .
They should also be paid better , for example , for Clinton .
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 is a starvation wage .
He wants to raise it to $ 15 an hour .
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear : once he says the minimum wage must be up , then he says he should not be altered .
But the big discussion in the coming months should probably be more about the tax policy of the two camps .
On one hand stands Trump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
His critics predict that the budget deficit will only increase .
On the other hand is Clinton , who wants at least to ask the rich that they pay more taxes , and whose critics say more taxes are not the solution either .

Why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
That 's what I imagine under the women 's Olympic team in the turret , for more than a reason .
First , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
And second : this team has three turners , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren `` Laurie '' Hernandez , who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color .
The structure of this team , which is Aly Raisman , who is Jüdin and Madison Kocian , who is a Catholic , makes everyone proud .
This team finally reflects the USA .
It solidified black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
In the past four years , number one among female turners was an Afro American .
Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 .
It shows strength .
At the last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic win and America jubilant .
Now the world was able to be witness to the incredible performance of triple world champions Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymastic routines .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We are witnessing the top of this sport , but so do turn classes across the country .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all suggested the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team .
They are the `` Last Five , '' because the next Olympic man will have only four turners in the team , and that is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer .
But the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport , and Turner is primarily in private tournaments , which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , set-up , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their turners and families ) ; the list can be continued anywhere .
The majority of these turnaround clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
In these clubs , the Turner will receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , trainer of Laurie Hernandez , have both trained their athletes since they started the turret .
We must allow the communities aun innumerable , young girls , inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie , a more accessible and accessible tournament training .
I founded my Turn Foundation of 20 years .
At my events , we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( mainly black and Hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
In September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer youth high quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Turnen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
It 's the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the turret and that 's great .
It is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
It 's such an exciting time .
Thanks Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby , Gabby , and Madison for this real representation of `` Girl Power '' by the hols of the Olympic team and thanks , motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .

The £2-a-day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug after authorities recommended that this more people be administered for a longer period of time .
The inhibitory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
NICE regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
NICE regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
Heart attacks and stroke attacks are caused by accumulating fat material in the arterial walls , which form coverings .
When the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood clotting that closes blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
When the blood clotting closes , it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
Ticagrelor , made by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique , reduces that risk by making the formation of blood clotting more unlikely .
NICE guidance , published today , recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : `` Despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all individuals who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . ''
Fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
Experience shows that Ticagrelor , in combination with Aspirin , is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stroke attacks in people who already had a heart attack .
Through a Ticagrelor preliminary recommendation , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit .
Information about the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years , the guidance draft does not recommend treatment beyond that period .

Cancer case : When the organiser pays
After their journey , sufferers will only receive money after their journey , if the cause of the disease is unquestionably found in the hotel .
But that is only the case when more than ten percent of guests show the same symptoms .
In the negotiated case , a family was seriously ill on diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday .
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
Their disorder led the holidaymakers back to a defective waste water treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater .
The family thought the trip was flawed - and clashed against the organiser .
In court , the plaintiffs had no success .
The waste water treatment plant was indeed defective .
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left .
He had to assume until then that the seawater was in order .
So he did not breach his information obligations , the ruling said .
No impurities were found in the samples of the water .
The disorder of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - is part of the overall risk of life .
Of 691 guests , only 38 were ill .

Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday , which found an income of $ US10.75 million for Democrats and her husband , and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 % .
In 2015 , the Clintons donated $ US1 million for charitable purposes , mostly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost $ US5.3 million in speech fees ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of $ US3 million by the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the Foreign Office .
Clinton 's nominee for the vice presidency , Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Holton , is publishing his tax returns of the past decade .
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
`` Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , '' Clinton 's Kampagnenhelferin Jennifer Palmieri said in an opinion statement .
In a stark way , Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backers to publish his tax returns in relation to his past promises .
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , even though they are obliged by law .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as reason for his refusal .
`` They are on the move , '' Clinton 's campaign director Ian Sams wrote on Twitter , referring to the release of the presidential candidates .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump 's special adviser , said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before tax audits are not completed .
Trump 's critics , including Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about assets , his donations for charitable organizations , his business dealings and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already plunged on the issue , posting a video on the internet on Friday , in which high-ranking Republicans Trump called for his tax return to be released .
On Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech on the Michigan economy .
`` He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and releases his tax returns , '' she said to the crowd .
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s for two years , and a New York Times economic journalist cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday who indicated that that still could be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett , who would ensure that people earning more than $ US1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
During an election campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its headquarters here , called on Trump to meet with a meeting to discuss their tax returns .
Buffett said he had also undergone a tax audit of the IRS and Trump had `` fear '' before voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax returns back to 2007 .
The Clintons , now living in Chappaqua , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 , and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
The 2015 Clinton 's tax return showed that these only earned USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
Their main money investment was a low-cost index fund , from which Clinton 's dividends and earnings of $ US109,000 were taxed .

Community , spirit , health : Singing is doing seniors well
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in Lehramt studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir .
`` Singing moves me - emotionally and physically , '' she describes .
After a sample , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says .
In addition , she does something good in her health and mind .
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives , says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniors League .
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people , described Hackler .
Through regular cooperation , seniors can make and maintain social contacts .
Because social and family structures are often settled in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
Ursel Kipp also made this experience in her choir : `` To talk and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction '' .
Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense , says Hackler .
Because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing .
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs does not quickly get out of the puste in everyday life .
Even when it comes to getting the sound of voice in age , singing is an optimum hobby .
Singing often has a very special effect on older people , says Ursula Lenz of the federal labor community of seniors '' organizations .
In older generations , common singing had a much higher profile , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explained .
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories , often linked to positive feelings of their youth time .
Through song lyrics and especially melodies , self-dementia sufferers remember long-past events .
When singing , the head is also required a special performance , Lenz explained .
At the same time focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm , adapting to the other singers - that 's a great cognitive challenge .
Especially older people who live alone do not just focus on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition you learn by singing in the choir , says Hackler .
A keen audience is a great praise .
Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir .
To show yourself : If I long for something , I 'll be better and growl beyond me - strengthening that experience .
So good reasons to start singing there are enough .
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent , Lenz says .
You do n't sings alone - at 50 singing people , who is listening when a sound goes on ?
Seniors have different options in search of the appropriate offer , says Hackler .
If someone comes out of the circle of friends in a seniors choir , you can simply join .
Many cities also offer overviews of choirs in the area .
If you want to sing in a church choir , you can contact the church or church guard .
Many seniors can also be found via the Internet .
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask family , friends or neighbours for help in internet searches .
Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , wheeling hackler .
Singing does well and has something liberating - that applies to every age .

Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly : `` It gets better ''
Like most 6-year-olds , Edmund Picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
But like the fewest of his ages , Edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder over which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy .
When he came home the first time , my first thought was I did n't manage that .
I do n't manage that .
I did n't get on that .
What is not true at all — of course , one has got on with it , '' she said .
Her husband , Vincent , and her husband were told that Edmund may never recognize them and that he may not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they should institutionalize it .
`` My first answer was ' I did n't know that people were still doing it , ' '' Picciuto said .
Edmund can run with help .
Edmund could not sit or crawl until his third year of life and he still can not speak .
But he is slowly making progress .
He can run with support and cycling .
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language , which Edmund has elaborated on for `` Please sing me something before '' . ''
`` We bring him character language , '' Picciuto told CBS News .
But it 's not a typical character language — she says Edmund has invented some characters alone .
Microcephaly has a variety of causes : genetic as well as edmund , as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the zikavirus during pregnancy .
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly .
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus .
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked , what will happen ?
What will happen ?
And she still does n't really know it .
I have n't asked for the forecast for a long time because I do n't expect it to really tell me anyone .
But Picciuto has a hopeful piece of advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus .
It gets better .
You know it will get better for you .
You will love your child and your child will love you .

Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche , and led to too little co-determination in the team 's decision-making process .
Alternative president / general manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed that decision and noted that the club will immediately seek a new coach .
`` Over the last three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , '' the 50-year-old Roy said in an opinion statement .
Over the summer , I 've long and much thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level .
To achieve this , the vision of the trainee and vice president of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
These conditions are not currently fulfilled .
Sakic , who had hired Roy on May 23rd 2013 , thanked him for his contributions to the team .
`` Patrick has informed me of this decision today , '' Sakic said .
We all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded as the league 's best coach during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
He led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years .
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups — two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .

Shoppers in Primark outraged over woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of business
Shoppers did n't know where to look when a woman pulled out their clothes amid a primark to try underwear .
To exacerbate the situation , she mustled as she looked in it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf .
She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underwear at a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone .
The Primark shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone , where the woman tried the underwear before putting her back in the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was at the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried underwear , `` she got back up and left the business without buying anything . ''
She said : `` People could n't believe what they saw . ''
In the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of underwear from the outlay , pulled her own tights and trousers and tried them .
`` She did n't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , cheeky like Oscar . ''
`` Everyone died when she pulled out the underwear that obviously did n't like her as she put her back on the shelf . ''
She repeated the same with three other underwear before finally deciding that she did n't like it , pulled back and rushed .
`` She did n't seem to disrupt it that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she tried . ''
Ms Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : `` How disgusting to think that someone would take home pants that had another person and who were n't washed . ''
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added : `` As I got along , staff tried to pull the garments out of sale after she went - which is just as good . ''
`` I would hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out another woman had her and pulled out again and did n't wash her . ''
A Primark spokesman said : `` Primark is aware of the incident , which occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our Folkstone branch . ''
All eligible products were withdrawn from sale .

Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information , congresses committee
United States Central Command military personnel altered intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual state conditions on the ground , a congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday .
The preliminary report , drawn up by a task force of Republican members of the Board of Conflict , Intelligence Committee and Wehrbudgetkommite , reported great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts , who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
Central Command , briefly Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` Intelligence information , typically notorious by senior Centcom commanders , regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed actual conditions on the ground and was consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , '' a newspaper article quoted the report as saying .
`` What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , '' said Ken Calvert , a Republican member of the House of Representatives .
The leadership errors in Centcom range up to the top top of the organisation .
The ten-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
Although it does not provide direct indications that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts face pressure from their prerogatives to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State threat , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` During the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements in front of Congress were significantly more positive than it did the facts , '' the report noted .
For example , a Centcom affiliate publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin as early as April or May 2015 .
Mossul , Iraq 's second largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
`` After months of investigation , it 's so clear , '' Mike Pompeo , Republican congressman from Kansas , said in an opinion statement .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq .
Republicans called the task force into life after they were told that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on Islamic State .
The report , published on Thursday , will be completed by more detailed findings while investigations will continue .
In addition , further investigations of Centcom reports are under way by the inspector general of the Ministry of Defence .
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday , agreeing with some of the Republican task force conclusions .
`` In 2014 and 2015 , Centcom created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services , '' the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee , a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff , announced in an opinion statement .
That process , Mr. Schiff said , `` delayed the publication of intelligence reports , '' damaging morale among analysts and `` gave overly little room for divergent opinions . ''
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said there was no indication of an intervention by the White House at Centcom analysts regarding a `` certain political opinion . ''
The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by `` The Daily Beast . ''
Last August , the New York Times reported from investigations by the Pentagon 's inspector general , who received complaints from Centcom analysts .
Lt. Cmdr . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon press spokesman , said in an opinion statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress while the inspection 's investigations were still underway .
But he also admitted that `` experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding interpreting complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . ''
The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that has now been made by a growing number of Defense Ministry members ) .
Last year 's accusations , however , raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
Criticism about secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of interceptions of more than ten years ago , when a Centcom analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush faced only a small crew force in Iraq , and little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State .
Last year , the team for Mr. Hooker , according to government officials , notes that , contrary to government statements , air strikes against the Islamic State-held refineries would not have any significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group , as these provisional refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
However , this finding was not published , the Times reported in September .
Centcom 's damning commander , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticised by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the state of war at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command .

28-year-old cook found dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
The victim 's brother said he ca n't imagine anyone wanting to harm him , `` finally it got uphill with him again . ''
The corpse found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco , told the San Francisco court medical department .
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
The victim 's brother , Louis Galicia , told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston , had made his dream job as a cook at Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were `` shocked and destroyed '' over his death .
`` We are a small team that works like a close family and we will painfully miss him , '' the spokesman continued .
Our thoughts and condolences are at this difficult time at Franks family and friends .
Louis Galicia said Frank initially lived in hostels , but that `` things finally went uphill for him . ''
`` He found a flat , he had a girlfriend , '' Louis Garcia told KGO .
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother .
He was a friendly person with a great heart .
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something , prepare us the dinner , '' Louis Galicia said .
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
He was the brother who swam with the stream .
`` With everything going wrong in the world , he was this unflattering diamond that lit bright every day , '' he said .
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD telephone number under number 415-575-4444 .

Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the bank 's chief executive , the RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role .
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank 's global ambitions .
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago .
During that time , brand strategists have used `` RBS '' to protect other end consumer financial brands .
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now she has chosen to put more national brands into focus .
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all RSB referees , the decentralised headquarters and the listing of NatWest will change .
Ulster Bank is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other , smaller brands for retail banking that will be more important - Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's Military Bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a tour tour of clients and employees in Inverness-shire .
He told BBC Scotland : `` The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more into a bank of brands now . ''
When the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became the global brand .
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals , but local goals .
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands .
RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
`` It 's time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus on inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? '' said the CEO .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs , not our own , I think we will see many changes .
We can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

In fact , the arch shooter got the madness on social media and admitted that he had already been told since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
`` I see no great similarity , except for face-to-face , '' Brady told the Huffington Post .
`` He 's a gutsy guy , so I 'm probably taking it as a compliment . ''
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more prominent this year : the alluring similarity between British springer Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
Russian turn Aliya Mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , is to be seen as a double-handedness for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan .

Police set tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system .
Police set up tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
The difficulties began when police officers tried to evade the students , resulting in police deploying rubber bullets and tear gas .
Several hundred students attended the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans .
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , fewer than 100 public schools are being closed , while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money .
Some of the protest participants were seen spraying graffitits against provisional president Michel Temer to walls .
The latest protests occurred several days after protesters took to the streets in crowds to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff , who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to leave .

French court rejects bid to demolition of shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by authorities in Calais to settle dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , where thousands of refugees live .
At a court hearing this week , the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be empowered to put down 72 provisional shops where people inside the warehouse sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or sell simple meals for a few euros at provisional restaurants .
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and sanitation risk .
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
They also said the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who operate the 72 provisional shops but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were `` absolutely understandable . ''
Judge Jean-François Molla said the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who `` live in extremely precarious conditions . ''
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places threatened by the downfall was the Jungle Book Kids ' Café of the Camp , which operates in a nonsense and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors in the camp .
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids ' cafe .
In a letter to the Guardian , it said the closure `` would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years old . ''
The Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants aid agencies estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer .

Kepler measures rotational rate of stars in star clusters of plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the plejades ' star .
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate in star clusters to different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods with the planetary formation are .
`` We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , '' Luisa Rebull , a researcher at Caltech 's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , said in a news release .
The plejades ' star cluster is 445 light years away from Earth .
Many stars in this star cluster , which emerged around 125 million years ago , now reach adulthood .
They now turn their fastest .
At peak rotation rates , these ripe stars are experiencing large amounts of star winds .
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a crushing effect on the stars .
When a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot — such as sunspots .
The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slow pirouettes than smaller ones .
`` In the Ballet of Plejades , we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars , '' Rebull said .
As the plejades ' star cluster is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates .
`` The star cluster of plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , '' Rebull said .
There is still much ahead of us about what we want to learn more about , how , when and why stars slow down their rotational rates and , so to speak , hang their `` dance shoes . ''
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the plejades ' rotational rates , which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal .

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass exodus
`` Anyone who does n't suit and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed caffeine , '' says the chair of the Gülen-close foundation Dialogue and World , Ercan Karakoyun .
In the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany is counting on tens of thousands of protectors fleeing Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term , it could even be `` a few hundred thousand '' , believes the association chairman , Ali Toprak .
Due to the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass exodus to Germany .
`` In the short term , I reckon with tens of thousands , with a few hundred thousand protectors from Turkey in Germany in the medium term , when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , '' says association chairman Ali Toprak of the `` world '' of Friday .
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago , 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are on their way .
After the sworn coup , secular and opposition ethnic Turks were still in addition .
Many will want to start new in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
`` It can not be that a state that even takes up refugees produces refugees in their own country , '' Toprak said .
The association chief lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Alevilian towns .
In doing so , Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
`` They are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced over the past hundred years , '' said Toprak , who is also CDU member .
The association chief called for the federal government to be `` as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters . ''
In Germany , too , a `` witch hunt '' is taking place against Erdogan critics .
I do n't feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the exodus of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition activists .
The brand mark as Gülen trailer annihilates teachers and other academics .
`` Anyone who does n't suit and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed caffeine , by the way , the kemalists and seculars , '' said Ercan Karakoyun , chairman of the Gülen-based foundation Dialogue and Education , the `` world . ''
As the newspaper reports , citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks made the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
On June 30 , 30 , this was 11,386 people , and thus almost 29 percent of all recognised applicants ( 39,625 ) .
This survey does not find the benefits of war , poverty or lack of prospects .
According to the Basic Law , asylum rights are exclusively political , i.e . from the state side .

Assistant doctors strike : demands for new workplace action
Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labor-fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
The Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has called on its entire council to approve more labor combat measures from early September .
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract .
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA .
He was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the election .
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had `` persistently calm '' to problems , resulting in the contract being rejected .
She said : `` In view of this , the JDC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official renegotiation to all your concerns . ''
In response to the government 's silence , the JDC board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor-fighting measures that begins in early September .
The disputes caused assistant doctors to strike six times this year , the first total outages in the history of the NHS .
BMA assistant doctor Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA .
He told BMA members during the meetings held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students that the contract was advantageous and should be approved .
After the vote , the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on doctors in England .

Culture of political correctness flowing up electoral fraud in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfor Rahman was removed last year at the request of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a damning government report revealed today .
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police , election observers and town hall officials for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to `` oversensitivities regarding ethnie and religion . ''
The former minister for integration and municipal government , which is now an anti-corruption case , said the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lockers outside election cabins to protect intimidated voters .
He recommends that voters should carry a card to prove their identity in elections .
At the moment , a voter must only name his name and address .
The report suggests not applying removable ink to a person 's finger when casting their electoral vote to prevent someone from electing twice .
Whistleblower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official commenters or working groups .
`` This is not only against electoral fraud , but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it , '' he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets electoral scandal in east London .
Last year , a special election court ruled that acting mayor Lutfor Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
The court ruled Rahman had `` perversely perverted '' the religious feelings of his Muslim community , and that he would have silenced his critics with racial and Islamophobial accusations .
Rahman is said to have `` conducted his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . ''
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
In particular , he expressed alarm at the fraudulent electoral election - during which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to sanitise the electoral system , including driving cards to prove identity
His report said : `` As proof it was appropriate to put pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , particularly women and young people , in order to vote in accordance with the will of older people , especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeschian background .
`` There were concerns that ... state institutions knowingly ignored such behaviour due to `` politically correct '' oversensitivities regarding ethnie and religion . ''
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to sanitise the system , including banning political activists from editing letter ballots to stop `` election harvests . ''
The report , considered by Theresa May , also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
Options consider asking voters for your ID before the election .
Use unremovable ink on a person 's finger as soon as she cast her voice to prevent someone from electing twice .
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible to vote .
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic letter choice .
Prohibition that political activists process full letter elections and envelopes of letter elections .
The police give the power to set up closures around election stations .
A change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 ( People 's Representation Act 1983 ) .
Photo ban in electoral stations .
The requirement that only English be used in electoral stations ( except for Wales ) .
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the electoral booth alone .
Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it `` amazing '' that no criminal complaint was made after Tower Hamlets .
`` The Electoral Court has declared Lutfor Rahman and his deputy to be unfit for purpose due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , '' he said .
For a number of reasons , he was found guilty sufficiently - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
He also criticises the impacted `` abhakcontrols '' of the electoral registration departments of the town hall .
Sir Eric said : `` The court ruling in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal .
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .

Britain picks silver in 7-er rugby after Fiji masterclass picks gold
Britain 's impressive performance at 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening in the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten up here in Rio with a score of 43-7 .
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling , side-stepping , afterward , line-running and raw force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain 's fourth that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , where they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
The Boks ' clear defeat , 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day , could fall back on them in the final .
But , regardless of that , Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form .
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably wo n't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fiji 's head coach Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind it .
Eight years ago , under Ryan , they lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens .
Here they lost only one .
This mud will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began marvellously , leaving GB 's attacks out of fun .
It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co. , as if going into driving buses , the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau scored in the corner .
With still four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball .
A hated tally of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Man Leone Nakarawa a third goal , but it only stopped Fiji .
In the seventh minute , Jasa Veremalua lashed a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new since the rebound and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak tacklings of the GB team and crashed down to the line to make a gate .
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break .
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learns .
So it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half , until Josua Tuisova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB , made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 , but the game had long been in favour of the South Seeinsulans , whose fans sang , flags snapped and danced in the gallery .
It was not hard to admire Fiji 's playful approach .
Mata Viliame set the i-bag with another try in the final seconds .
The pfiff hung , the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kickstarted crashing into the lawn .
Earlier on the day Fiji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 defeats and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Britain 's conversion of the difference .
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half , but Dan Norton broke down the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .

`` A generation protested '' in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the U.S .
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia stalled at violent opposition from the government .
Witnesses say that a few protesters were killed during clashes with police during shooting .
Is Ethiopia just collapsing ?
Over the past decade , it has been one of Africa 's most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
But in recent months , protests against the government have shaken the country and spread into more and more areas .
Last week , thousands of people stormed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
The government 's response was merciless , according to human rights organizations .
Witnesses said police shot and killed officers on a few unarmed protesters .
Video about the protests , presumably from the last or early this year , shows how security people are beating young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall .
The head of the U.N. human rights authority now calls for an in-depth investigation .
`` It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , '' said Rashid Abdi , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia , but only a few countries in Africa receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia 's economy expanded at a significant pace .
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa .
The roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to cite repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissidents effectively silenced .
Many were sent into exile or jail , killed or driven into the desert .
But that could change .
`` If you suppress people and do n't have other options other than to protest , it breaks out , '' said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
The whole youth protested .
A generation protested .
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticized election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
At the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea ; a battle for this crunchy , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts fear separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front , which have been more or less confined in recent years , could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again .
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of falling under the surface .
The first seems harmless : smartphones .
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones became more common and internet services improved .
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does regularly , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying .
Several young Ethiopians said they were so gathered to protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since Eons , the Amharas , who come from Ethiopia 's mostly Christian Highlands , prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos , many of whom are Muslim and live in flat land areas .
But that too is changing .
`` We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella , '' said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of the Oromos .
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group , which account for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , intelligence , trade and politics .
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr. Meles , a former rebel leader , was Ethiopia 's prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
He was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners .
Analysts say he was particularly adept at exercising early signs of discontent and using special agents to edit opponents and make them harmless .
`` The current regime lacks this fundamental skill , '' said Mr. Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopia 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr Mele 's position .
Unlike Mr. Meles , who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia , Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray .
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uptick was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections that , according to analytics , were seemingly swept away by the government and subsequently stolen .
During the following raids , many protesters were killed , even though it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest went relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , like the new commuter train , as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty .
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the Ethiopian government 's internal misgivings .
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month protesters at Gondar , an amharic city , Tigray-led business , and hatred of the Tigray become increasingly popular on social media .
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position .
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drones over neighbouring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it was closing this base .
While the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
`` This , '' Mr. Abdi said , `` is a very thin grate migration . ''

Donald Trump election campaign charged after staff allegedly pulled gun
New York : Donald Trump 's campaign has been accused of alleged inaction after it was announced that her campaign director for North Carolina was targeting a shooting gun on an employee in February while traveling in a Jeep .
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in that state .
Bordini admitted having waited for months that the matter would be regulated internally before realising that `` that would not happen . ''
The campaign manager , Earl Philip , `` pulled a pistol , put his right finger on the deduction , and rammed the run into Vincent 's knee throat , '' Bordini admitted in his indictment .
After complained to the local and regional campaign management , Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip , he admitted in the indictment .
`` Guns do n't have to be fired to cause damage , '' Bordini admitted .
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential front-runner triggered an uptick when he told a crowd in North Carolina that `` second amendment people '' - gun owners and gun friends - should take action if his rivaline Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges .
Trump 's campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not incur violence .
Bordini 's complaint demands damages from the campaign for the breach of duty of care and Philip for the violation of the law and permanent psychological damage .
Trump 's press spokeswoman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion .
Attempts to contact Philip were just as wrong .
WCCB , a local intelligence officer in Charlotte , says Phillip is no longer a campaign employee .
There was no response to calls at his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far run a controversial campaign .
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc. , 16-CS -14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

Russia & Iran trade suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Levan Dzhagaryan , trade sales between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent annually .
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , interest on the part of Russian companies has grown heavily on business in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking existing ties with Iran , while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
Of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , '' Dzhagaryan said .
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 , compared with the same period in 2015 , and were $ 856 million .
In particular , Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5 percent and were $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
The trade boost was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , '' the ambassador said .
Dzhagaryan is out of record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
Last year , the Russian foreign ministry issued around 35,000 visas , primarily Reisevisas , to Iranian citizens .
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
It could be said that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are being broken , `` he said .
At the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
`` I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd , which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , '' he said .

Witnesses searched : Beverage market in forest brittle
A robbery raid was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstrasse .
Under the auspices of a shot gun , three darkly dressed people who had their faces purposely demanded the release of cash and then initially flew on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW golf .
The police do not share the amount of money .
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres tall , so relatively small .
The beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and can be viewed badly .
After the attack , the perpetrators must be torn down in the direction of Gerberstraße , Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and be wed by the gravel-coloured car located opposite the parking lot , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Silverstein Ring ) .
Anyone who has made observations in connection with the robbery ( about 7.45 p.m. ) will urgently report to the police .

CBC commentator for the Olympics apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmers `` have died like a pig ''
Byron MacDonald 's analysis of fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-style swimming season outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypical games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer `` went off like Mief '' and during the race like `` a pig died . ''
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was switched off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style swimming season .
MacDonald , who had been picked up on board the CBS commentator to give more `` color , '' could be heard saying : `` This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection , baby . ''
Excited , went off like Mief , died like a pig .
Thank you for that .
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan , 14 , swam the second stage of swimming season 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada 's Taylor ruck , allowing Canadians to close the gap with China .
Viewers across Canada quickly responded online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted , `` Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China `` has died like a pig '' ? ''
The idiot did not realise they were still on shipment . ''
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free-style swimming season for women : `` This small 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection , baby . ''
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard , when many made him speech
Twitter users did n't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter userin Sarah Paradis wrote : `` Wow , # ByronMacDonald .
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists . # eneked .
A short time later , Scott Russel , who moderated the CBC broadcast , apologized live for comment by MacDonald , saying : `` We apologise that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . ''
It was an unhappy formulation , we 're sorry it happened . ''
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times for people who responded to the bemusement via Twitter
Commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about the comments made by MacDonald
The network also apologised quickly and issued a notice .
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them .
Yesterday night we apologised quickly to our viewers on broadcast and our followers on social media .
To make one thing clear , Byron 's comments relate to the swimmer 's performance , not to her as a person .
Nevertheless , they were inappropriate and an unhappy formulation , Byron does what he said .
On Thursday afternoon , MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment , saying it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
`` I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women 's swimming season in the CBC Olympiscope , '' he said .
`` I was referring to the performance of the swimmers and not to them as a person . ''
Of course no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry . ''

Travel guide Ian Wright sends his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller subjected his immune system and Würgereflex to serious scrutiny - by deleting some of Europe 's dirtiest and most egregious places .
The presenter and travel writer , Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk , departed from Suffolk on a Euro-gig , a railroad at Piccadilly Circus , a sprinkler of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system .
Before leaving each object , he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get into .
But the experiment , which was filmed under the title `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' brought some surprising results to light .
The idea of leaking the sprinkler of a train toilet , already used by thousands of others , may be completely repulsive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen flush .
On his journey through Europe , Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
Luckily nothing left him behind , more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and offering strange and wonderful things .
From public changes at stations to flushing toilets , the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film , he said : `` Already as a child I was relatively unconcerned as to my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film , he was in any case fair to his reputation .
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
His sample was a luminometer number of over 4000 units .
In comparison , the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' which shows the bacteria number in different places like the bathroom
In the film , he says : `` That comes down to the worst thing I 've gotten in a toilet . ''
There is nothing more dirty than that !
I 'm not going to lick anything here because it 's indoors here .
`` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio .
The company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus , which includes both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` We really wanted to offer consumers something new .
Something that 's fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics .
We ran crazy brainstormings that ended that we said `` Let 's call Ian . ''
They claim interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hakala , who led the film 's directing , added : `` Let me say it like that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had loved some of the things I 'd instructed him to lick , like the eerie Russian toilet shown in the film . ''
Of course , there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was pretty difficult .
I 'm glad we 've taken some of these dirty leaks on film . ''
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio , 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria , particularly with the wellbeing of stomach and intestines , and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria .

Airline not liable : crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
For liability is only conceivable in the case of dangers typical of aviation , argued the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf ( 18 U 124/14 ) .
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc during the crash .
However , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , the court said .
The airline had no compensation to the man .

Pokémon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It 's fascinating watching how the world changes .
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , rather preferring to spend their leisure time on screens , has been lamented by many over the last decade .
Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active .
The time at the screen was initially on the television , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
So it 's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do n't mutually exclude each other .
I refer , of course , to the Pokémon Go-Wahn , an app based on the characters originally created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a series of characters , game cards and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell in early July .
Market introduction in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that overloaded the servers .
Within a few days , Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons , which are tracked with a GPS and , once found , can be `` photographed '' ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or `` captured . ''
A generation that played the game when she was even younger joined the craze and jumped for the search from the sofa .
In the United States , the game led to a significant increase in steps that the `` average '' person replaces every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch that traces 35,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game 's launch , the number of folks who train for 30 minutes every day , from 45 percent to 53 percent , was demanding .
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data on performance .
Many public health education campaigns that want people to `` take 30 minutes '' to `` get out of the sofa '' and `` be active every day '' stir on deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look eleven .
Nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be overvalued .
Whoever drives sports regularly reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
Physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun for them .
Thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people even close new friendships .
As always , there are also mouthful playoffs that always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could run against a door .
What should ?
A breakthrough has occurred .
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were already tracking our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game .
The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease over time .
However , due to Pokemon 's success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

The reason in the double pack
The municipal council focused on issues related to construction in the recent meeting .
With relief , the board took the notice from Mayor Robert Putz that `` finally , the marketing of recently designated residential construction areas can begin . ''
After the land , parcel and development issues and the applications for surveying could be clarified , the sale of the land in the residential areas of `` road lane '' and `` Schönau-West '' ( section of Binderstraße - extension section 1 ) to interested parties no longer stands in the way .
The municipal council is convinced that the land in the rural and quiet residential community of Schöau will equally address young families and senior seniors .
As it has been said , building wilderness can be reported immediately in town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .
In order to also be able to enquire about the relocation of other commercial establishments , linked to the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan recently created in the spring of this year .
Thus , in the subtimn area , the commercial area already designated is extended by two plots towards state road 2112 .

USA wins fourth match in women 's field hockey , a showdown with Britain
A day after she shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women 's field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that Americans won 3-0 .
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but Bam ( 27 ) said she could n't remember having ever done that .
`` I have no idea , '' she said .
I 'm not one of the people who keep their gates in mind .
However , it knows : the Americans are 4-0 in Olympic competition and are in their group with the British in their first place , unbeaten after their 2-0 win against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group from six teams .
The first place will take the strong Dutch out of the way that the other group leads .
Whatever the game on Saturday , Americans have caused a surprising swirl through their success story , four years after they landed at last year 's London Games at the last of 12 places .
Bam was part of this team .
She grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a hockey squirrel for the first time at three years ( her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University ) , at 16 , she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the team 's history .
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could n't qualify for the kader .
Then came 2012 , where everything went wrong for her and her team .
In the following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , coach of the national team , and thus things started to turn better .
`` A culture change , a mental change and a physical change , '' Bam said .
We did n't have the workload in London we have now .
We can tear the ruder around completely .
On Thursday evening , Bam opened the torre in the first half of the game with a backhand shot from close range .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly fenced and kept the 1-0 game up to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands .
She carried a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved into the middle and lugged the ball into the gate to give the American a 2-0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper , Jackie Briggs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
She has a run .
Just like Bam .
`` We 're in a good position , '' said Parnham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .

Cats react more sensitive than katers to cries of the young
Biologists have studied in Hanover the effect of rowing cat babies on adult animals .
To their surprise , the males also did not leave the males cold - however , unlike the females , they always behaved the same way .
Female cats can detect the excitement of cat babies at the mouth of the little ones .
They respond by ten percent more quickly to loudness of kittens who are in great distress , as scientists have found out from the veterinary university and medical university Hanover ( MHH ) .
Katers are also responding to kittens ' calls - but always the same .
`` Apparently , the acoustic differences between seeing less and heavily excited young animals are either not perceptible or not significant for the males , '' said biologist Wiebke Konerding of MHH .
She is first author of the study , published this Friday in the specialist magazine `` BMC Evolutionary Biology . ''
In a previous investigation , the team of researchers had already found out that the duration and pitch of kittens ' cries was different to the urgency of their need for help .
A total of nine adult katers and eight female MHH animals were observed .
They were played on the one hand by little ones , who were taken out of the box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings .
Secondly , they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens , who were additionally raised .
Researchers believe their results , despite the low sample , to be meaningful .
`` All females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , responded differently to the cries , '' Konerding said .
They turned faster to the speaker when this rowing of the very angry kittens played off .
This ability may be innate or develop with gender maturity .
`` A surprise was that the males responded at all , '' the biologist said .
In the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises several times in the past .
Also , some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to babies , whether they were already mothers or not , reported biologist Marina Scheumann .

Rain instead of star : hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star nude guckers in south west Germany a stroke through the bill on Friday - yet there is hope .
The night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the Welzheim star , Hans-Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
Our hope is on the night of Saturday .
The weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see many star nuts in the sky .
The star scales are Perseiden , which , at 216,000 kilometres per hour , is one of the fastest stars .
They have their name because they seem to come from the Perseus star , which goes up in the northeast .

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : `` Dahin go where it hurts ''
Seldicames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the landtag .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood .
In 2021 , the election of the country will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwerins Parliament decided earlier this year .
This is not the case in the past : summer holidays , heat and the election of the country .
The locals , who will be persuaded by the election campaigners , are on holiday .
The vast majority of holidaymakers in the country , on Usedom , Rügen or Hiddensee , are not locals , so are not allowed to choose the land day .
There are practical problems : in the holidays , helpers who hang up posters , blow up air balloons , distribute flyers and count votes at the end of the day , only painstakingly pick up .
Until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final day of the day , Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to leave the race just short of the people .
The hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
And it 's also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear for his office .
The SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU in polls .
What is exciting is how much neuling AfD cuts and what 's left at the end of coalition dust .
Sellering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost inconspicuous campaign , seen from his large posters .
He travels through the country , distributes roses and speaks a little with the people , just as his legendary legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did .
Otherwise , soul ring has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame at the AfD .
Her refugee policy , her `` We are creating that , '' has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office .
The CDU , with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier , has already experienced how it is to campaign at the wrong time in the right place .
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations ; Merkel Bundestag constituency is in the north east .
But the target group did not agree , it was more North Rhine-Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern .
`` There was probably a majority of other federal states , '' Vincent Kokert , general Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , recently told NDR .
But it also pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
Otherwise , the North-East CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons .
This , Kokert believes , only plays a `` subordinate role . ''
The union , too , has noticed that the country is leaving the base , that it must make great efforts to find a wire to the people again .
It is like the Left , the SPD , the Greens : there are hardly any in the country 's expanses .
However , the CDU elector Kokert , to his co-conspirators , is also self-sustaining : `` They must go where it hurts , which is where the people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . ''
Because much is at stake , Sellering has now called his SPD a particularly committed campaign .
In polls , the Social Democrats last stood at 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just short of the AfD ( 19 ) .
In the 2011 election , the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , small party with seven percent in the polls , are expected to make the leap into the landtag .
They make a modern virtue from holiday distress and largely transfer their campaign to the Internet .
`` Online election campaign , '' says state chairman Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green election campaigners will go on track searching for local voting citizens among holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , the top candidate , curvy with a house boat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and also finds it beautiful .
Her impression : `` Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment . ''

Ms. in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was caught driving on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight .
A woman put himself in the dark `` in an act of desperation '' and was hit by several cars , police said in Vaud .
It is clear that a Swiss woman aged 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a lorry , himself wanted to kill himself .
She still died on the ground .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said police , calling on them as well as any witnesses to the incident to sign up .
An investigation has been opened , which is a `` logical '' step in such a situation , Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
Was a collision avoidable ?
This is something the prosecutor must decide , '' Hofstetter said .
Two similar cases over the past five years show drivers are not being held accountable .
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists would not have to expect a pedestrian to run on the highway in the middle of the night , according to the newspaper .
Last year , a police officer was acquitted of negligent killing after driving and killing a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014 .
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street , the court noted .
The court found that the policeman — who responded to an emergency call — drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a `` completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation , '' the judge said .
Anyone who has further information on Thursday 's incident near Morges should contact the police at number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .

Post rises into trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
The interest of other companies is apparently great .
The Mail plans to sell its electric vehicle Streetscooter as well .
The group will shortly start trading the transporter .
The Mail will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year .
`` We want to get into sales to third parties , '' a post spokesman said on Friday .
The company has been checking for months whether to sell its self-developed street scooter , with the letters and packs , to other businesses as well .
Post board member Jürgen Gerdes had said there were always questions such as craftspeople .
According to information from the news magazine `` Der Spiegel '' , the Bonner Group wants to enter into mass production of the vehicles shortly .
In postown manufacturing , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and shift .
Gerdes announced that the group would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and long-term a full shift to environmentally friendly vehicles .
`` We will make a very , very robust move towards 2020 , '' he said at the end of July .
I can imagine that we will change the fleet .
The street scooter has been active on Germany 's roads since 2014 .

Fleeing : `` Every wed woman has experience of sexual violence ''
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women fleeing alone .
When they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatised .
A house offers refuge .
In a large kitchen , four women sit .
Each has a baby that is at most one year old .
One has put her little son in the arm .
He looks curious into the room with big eyes .
His mother stares at the table .
Until she notices she is being watched .
She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones .
The scene acts normally .
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr .
She is an area business leader of Condrobs , a promoter of social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women , among other things .
The four women in the kitchen are poultry .
They live in the Munich north in one of the few devolved accommodation for all-female women and their children in Bavaria .
In January , Condrobs made up the facility along with Pro Familia and the Munich women 's aid .
It has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - around 40 women and 20 children .
Men are not there - neither as visitors .
The exception is a watchman in front of the door .
`` It 's not exaggerated to say that every woman arriving here has experienced experiences of sexual violence on their escape , '' Bahr says .
`` Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hopefuls , '' she says .
In women , other reasons outweigh the escape : `` Many steal themselves secretly because they do n't see another way out . ''
In their home country they have experience of sexual violence , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
It continues it .
The escape goes on .
`` That wickets for example for a bottle of water require a sexual act is not a rarity , '' says Bahr .
And women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
Who thinks that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany , tells Bahr .
Here , too , single women in refugee accommodation would often be considered inferior and at worst abused .
This leads to some 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich north traumatised , she estimates .
`` Some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . ''
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
`` Or they do n't trust talking openly about the experience because shame is too big . ''
Because they often do n't want to help , they need more accommodation only for them , Bahr asks .
In Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
As for whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich , some answered no .
In the Upper Palatine and Oberfranken , for example , there is no such thing in the accommodation of governments .
Even in swabs , women wed alone will not be housed separately , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , government spokesman for the government .
In Upper Bavaria , under- and middle franks , there are floors or own houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children .
The exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation only for women .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men .
In a study published for the committee , it says : `` It is very important for men and women to be housed separately . ''
`` If privacy is lacking or men and women are put together , there can be - more persistent - violence against women .
In particular , washrooms should be separated and accessible to women , according to the study .
How much women feel like this need for protection can be seen at the heart of the house in Munich .
`` Since talking about it , we have a long waiting list , '' says Bahr .
You could easily make a second house .

Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany 's Rinters have to adjust to the next generation of speed knives : in different federal states , including Hesse and Brandenburg , new lightning devices are being tested that are supposed to carry pace sinners particularly effectively .
Vitronic 's futuristic enforcement trailer from Wiesbaden can be used at accident spots , for example , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
For example , at motorway construction sites or to gentle bridges with tempolitic tempoles , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary lightner .
However , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
The Enforcement Trailer is autark : Its battery holds five days in uninterrupted measuring operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
With laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks .
Variable speed limits as well as passage bans by time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
The trailer can be moved in the high-powered state , according to manufacturers with any car clutch .
In order for it not to be simple , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so the wheels disappear in the armored and , incidentally , shot outer shell .
In addition , a built-in alarm system will protect the lightner from vandalism .
Since 2015 , the trailer has been tested and now used in various federal states , according to Vitronic .
Foreign authorities are also blitzing with the new technology : Younger France has ordered 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year .

What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook .
In December 2014 , he first picked gold at the short-haul world championships in Doha , putting his first world record at the same time .
Now , former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself in front of Facebook in front of his ex-team-mates .
`` In a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 €premium and a jungle king €150,000 , no one should be surprised at missing medals , '' the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday .
The support system in swimming is bad , but the doping controls are very good .
In this way , we can not compete with countries that promote very much and do not look so closely at doping or even run it .
`` I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here , '' he continued .
If he had a comeback , Deibler would have to be notified nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency ( NADA ) .
That is exactly how we should keep it with countries .
`` Anyone who can not be controlled for a period of time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WADA / FINA can not take part , '' asks the election hamburger , who now runs an ice cream division .

Donald Trump admits ″ huge problems ″ in election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the Republican stronghold of Utah .
A rare moment when the normally big-spurned and self-reliant multi-millionaire expressed something like concerns , correspondents reported .
After throwing 16 rivals inside the Republican camp , doubts are now growing about his success in the battle for the White House .
`` We have huge problems in Utah , '' Trump said of evangelical Christians , who he asked for support in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
Guilt was false reports of his candidature , he resumed his well-known media blaze .
Republican strongholds wacky
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans .
According to a June poll by SurveyUSA , Trump and his rival , Hillary Clinton , were equal .
Other institutes see Trump ahead , though not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered .
In an interview by CNBC sen. Trump , Trump responded to how he wanted to stop Clinton 's advance : `` Just as I have done so far . ''
And shouting back : This will `` either succeed , or I 'll make a very nice , long holiday . ''
He does nothing else than `` tell the truth . ''
If there is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that 's fine , Trump continued .
Then I return to a very good way of life .
According to press reports , the party is supposed to have threatened Trump to cancel funds to support his campaign , should he not be able to present better poll values .
Instead , the Republicans ' candidates want to get more under-represented .

Podolski picks up with `` Gala '' after Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey .
In Turkey , a warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
For the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match has resumed in Turkey .
Before the duel of the archrival between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the conya Supercup , the official line is clear : `` Business as usual '' is said .
Even in the imposition of the state of emergency after the overthrow attempt in July , the government stressed that ordinary citizens should not be affected .
But that does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , whom one is responsible for the coup attempt .
It does not stop before football .
The prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against former star kicker Hakan Sükür .
Thus , the South American , now living in America , is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sükür is to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is being blamed by state President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
Although the state of emergency , initially imposed for 90 days , is still valid until October , it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks .
The nightly `` democracy guards '' at public places across the country have declared Erdogan an end on Wednesday .
Sport - like the whole country - is split into Erdogan 's supporters and opponents .
Fans of the Besiktas worker club are traditionally not among the president 's friends .
What most of the Turks , however , united in the face of dramatic experience in history , is the strict rejection of military puts .
Even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether their heart is beating for Galatasaray or Besiktas .
At the cup winner `` Gala '' , it will come back to Lukas Podolski especially .
The Cologne team proved its sporting value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31-year-old finished his first time as the top scorer of his club .
In the final game against Fenerbahce , he scored the 1:0 victory .
The `` Fanatik '' newspaper joked him : `` He was the best on the pitch . ''
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the Cup .
Thanks to `` Poldi , '' the disappointing season for the record master found a conciliatory conclusion .
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League , the `` Lions '' also distinguished themselves in the Europa League early .
In South Lig , only ranked sixth .
The season was not good .
The cup was the only way to win something .
`` We managed that and that 's the most important thing , '' Podolski said .
For champions Besiktas , the game year ran better .
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez , who presented the base to the 14th title with 26 seasonal goals as a South-Lig tennis champion .
That is also the reason fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old .
According to the coup attempt , the Gomez , who was under contract with AC Florence , only announced to Gomez after the coup attempt not to return to the country because of the political situation in the country .
`` If Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say it , '' Cited the specialist magazine `` Kicker '' club chief Fikret Orman .
In order to do this , however , the stormer would have to be willing to renounce around a third of his year-old , estimated at 7.5 million euros , Orman said : `` We can not pay for his salary at Florence . ''

Volkswagen is still glimpsed .
Despite diesel scandal , delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
But it is not in all markets .
There is a spinal cord in the recall campaign .
Volkswagen will start deliveries more cautiously in the second half of the year .
In spite of the diesel affair , Europe 's largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in the past year despite its many brands and some well-run markets .
But in July , the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe , thereby restarting the overall sale , as indicated by the Dax company .
Worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer cars in July with 449100 cars than the same month last year .
In Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than last year .
In the home market Germany , deliveries sacked by almost a sixth .
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
In addition , in some core markets , there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets .
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote to leave the EU has also burdened , a spokeswoman said .
In the USA , where the exhaust gas affair escalated first , a minus is also continuing .
The big support for VW is the Chinese market .
Overall , the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is already continuing to glimpse through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only a 0.9 percent extradition minus is to 3.37 million vehicles .
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to present a sales plus from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during that time , worldwide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests using a software .
In Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars for conversion into workshops .
In the course of the conversion , VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact .
After the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
The car manufacturer will provide a `` guarantee equal '' certificate to the customer after the conversion , but does not speak of a `` guarantee , '' as it said on Friday in corporate circles .
The reason is legal .
The `` Focus '' reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee of upgraded diesel models .
This would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Transportation Department .
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
`` VW has full compliance with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA . ''
`` Variations of this are not accepted , '' Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) said , according to the ministry .
VW has accepted the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion , and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values will be unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term `` guarantee '' as it was in corporate circles .
In the broad term `` guarantee , '' Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers might come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion , and could return this to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
It is also important in the interests of the customer to avoid that any other damage that has nothing whatsoever to do with the exhaust scandal will result in uncertainty regarding possible warranty schemes as it was called .
That is why VW does not use the term `` guarantee '' .

Ensuring clarity for 31 years
The managing director of the `` Veitenstein Group , '' Ruppert Göller , is retiring .
The association is regarded as `` Bavarian . ''
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
Some time ago it was in the original tone of the Bavarian Radio .
Little later , the water forum of the government of Unterfranken commended the purpose federation .
The work of the Veitenstein Group applies `` Bavarian far as exemplary . ''
Behind all this is Rupert Göller , who was 31 years in the association of employees , of which 28 years as the managing director .
Now he has been retiring at the age of 65 .
The Veitenstein Group with its headquarters in Kottendorf , municipality of broadband , promotes approximately 150000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants .
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchloud , Broadbrunn , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach .
Water supply contracts exist for other cities and municipalities .
The current president , Broadbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert Göller , in 1985 , was set up as a waterkeeper and has already been appointed Managing Director of the Association of Objectives in 1988 .
`` His duties have been very varied and they have covered water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budgeting , calculation of fees and contributions , and emergency rates for weekend ends , '' said the chairman .
As outstanding events , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renovation of water pipes .
There has been no stalemate , and there have always been innovations , because water is the most important food in the world , and drinking water is the most important food .
In her Laudatio , she praised Göllers 's faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
He has set himself up with a great deal of heart blood for his water group , and he has actually lived up to the Water Management Association as if it were his own company .
A few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group to reduce nitrates in the water forum of the Unterfranken area .
He has received a great deal of praise and praise for this .
Rupert Göller , for his part , praised Alfons Gabrael , who worked with him for 28 years .
He is the best waterkeeper and he was a faithful knee .
Together we were an unbeatable team .
As a highlight from his point of view , he described the construction of the fountain and the reorganisation of the purpose federation .
However , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the collapse of the high container at Kirchlouer on a third January .
Here we have to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the villages could be fed with water .
It was also possible to maintain the supply of Neubrunn only because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses .
The management of the drinking water service association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter , who took the succession of Rupert Göller .

The depressing food of the economic crisis in `` a rich meal ''
In March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
As a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicatessen from Fifth Avenue , such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland waterturtle soup .
Its menu on this day was slightly more modest : Filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato puree and as desserts a plum pudding .
`` It was an act of culinary solidarity with people suffering , '' said Jane Ziegelman .
Her husband Andrew Coe added , `` It was also a message to Americans how they should eat . ''
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coes last book `` Chop Suey '' was about Chinese cuisine in the US , while Ziegelman told her book `` 97 Orchard '' about life in a home on the lower East Side from the food perspective .
Her latest collaboration , `` A decent meal , '' which will be released on Tuesday in Harper Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg 's Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small snake snack in the Flatiron District , which has been in the business since the 1929 stock market crash .
Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives , while Coe , 57 , Truthahn had a potato purple and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten , this was the couple for a discussion about food in the Great Depression era .
`` Great food was very popular , '' said Ziegelman .
There was ground bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap , which is the ingredient of the ingredient .
Imagine to eat so many nuts that they serve them as dinner .
CoE grinded .
`` It must be in the stomach like lead , '' he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all-you-can-eat buffet .
Teams of women coined for male Feldarmen and it was served with freshly baked pastes for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War , and `` a Square Meal '' sets out the ways in which the country could no longer be the shlaring country .
`` It was a time when food was a central , tense topic for Americans , '' Coe said , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
The new budget disobedience was just as tense : Mysterious foods such as bread and casserole have become staple foods , the casserole as a `` wonderful way of revaluing the remains of food , '' noted the gods , as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
Meat , which was the focus of American cuisine for years , became a seldom served luxury .
Unique mixtures have been tried out , since a calorious and nourishing satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cooking .
During her search for the book , which includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a court of this period , baked onions with peanut butter .
`` It was not a popular addition to lunch , '' says Coe .
Ziegelmann continues : `` It was surreal . ''
Peel butter and baked onions do not match each other .
It was typical for many of the homebusiness receptions .
As never before , or since then , household economists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have been doing so in such a way .
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become `` household politicians '' and to meet the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carnival into delicious meals .
`` A Square Meal '' is a feast of the historical Leckerbissen .
In particular , the reports of the government 's response to the starving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen , are particularly tasty .
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa Farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen , he starred like the millionaire man from the world to which he has become .
`` He liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce , '' Coe said .
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smoking .
He was truly alien to reality .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife , Eleanor , had not asked him to set an example with his stomach .
As described in the book , the Anheuern of a housekeeper , with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt , said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also prepared one of the most troublesome . ''
Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food were discarded as soon as the country came back on its feet .
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegelman , and how science was applied to food .
When writing the book , the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman 's mother-in-law - for example , how it could not throw away food .
`` It had a real fear of food waste , '' Coe said .
Ziegelman recalled : `` They made people ill . ''
There was a windfall incident .
After leaving the Teller at Eisenberg 's , they and Coe created a dessert that they had prepared at home : The plum dessert that President Roosevelt had at lunch .
`` It is called Prune Whip , '' said Ziegelman , adding that it was a normal trick to miss modest recipes .
There was no scared cream , only plums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Everyone appeared somewhat grudgingly a spoon in the tame , brown glibber .
Amazingly , it was not bad .
CoE took up three times a night .
As a Can-Do-budgetierer he said to his wife , `` A few hacked walnuts would help . ''

B27-Sanation : Restaurants suffer from blocking
There is nothing to forget about the speed with which the B 27 is renovated .
There is a lot of praise for those responsible for the construction work which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at 20 : 00 .
`` These have made things quite zacky , '' says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet tank .
This is a super-team .
Nor is there any default .
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October .
Praise will also be given to those responsible for the work of the works , for instance when it comes to setting up temporary journeys .
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg also exists , the traffic situation has relaxed within the place .
The citizens of Ofterdingen are now back on both sides of the B 27 .
There seems to be a return of traffic through the place .
`` Since there were some serious complaints , '' says Florian King , responsible for the management of the renovation .
The residents of Bakhenstraße , Steinlachstraße , Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many light routes were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signage .
What led to some lorry driving in residential areas .
Since the speed limits have not been observed , the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from Mössingen .
`` There have been considerable overruns , '' says King , who made himself aware of the situation on the ground .
There have already been two to three per minute .
The quickest was travelling with 77 kilometers in the Tempo-30 zone .
Since the site has been moved , it has become more quiet .
For the businessmen at the B 27 , it is only a small consolation that the road is open to customers from Rottenburg .
They are not happy to look at the cards .
But that the B 27-Sanation has led them to take up sales , each one is asked to look through .
However , some are more and some less affected .
Those who have less to do with the `` end customer '' are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has little effect .
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a `` slight decline '' of the car in Maier , but also admits that `` the race is missing . ''
The most exploited are the clubs along the road .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the steakhouse , formerly crown , finds clear words .
This is already threatening .
Not only it , but all restaurants have `` hit hard . ''
It failed customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil .
We must be happy with every euro turnover .
The loss of turnover amounts to `` well above 50 % . ''
The road recovery has `` thrown back two years . ''
Half of his staff had to dismiss him .
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been made redundant , the policy would have reacted differently .
Instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a question by Göhner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the indication that the restaurant will benefit from the benefits of the situation at the B 27 . Now , it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation .
Göhner knows about other districts where it has been handled more generously .
In all complaints , Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
Finally , the family business has been here since 1715 , it refers to the long history .
It can be understood that other regular guests are now less frequently watching because of the complicated mode of transport .
If you can not drive , it is also nice elsewhere .
Göhner has no doubt that his tribal clientele will come back to the end of the remediation work .
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza , Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 work on his customers for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history .
Six months of work , which is already brutal .

Bombing in Thailand - Austrians injured - Several deaths
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schnöll , Friday morning .
She has suffered cuts and has been treated in hospital , but have already been able to leave it .
Your home trip was scheduled for the beginning of September .
It is still unclear whether the other explosions on the island of Phuket , as well as in the southern towns of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon , also affect Austrian citizens .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities .
Hua Hin , located around 200 km south of Bangkok 's capital , has exploded in two bombs on Thursday evening in a quarter of the city .
According to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrians , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning , there were once again two exploits , and another human being killed , according to the authorities .
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning .
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the popular beach of Patong , which was popular on holidaymakers .
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country , another bomb killed an urban employee .
The earthquake , according to the authorities , went into the air in a flower bed in front of the Refour of the Coastal Police .
After the end of the Second World War , Phang Nga and Trang , on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast , called for a number of injuries .
From a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin , it was said .
`` The bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , '' said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists .
`` We believe that this is a coordinated attack . ''
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably they are the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media , too , wanted to recognize in the attacks a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
The Thai police , on the other hand , said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or to international terrorism .
`` This is only local sabotage , limited to limited areas and provinces , '' said a spokesperson in Bangkok .
Rather , it is believed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid .
In the past few days , the authorities would have received secret references to imminent attacks in the south of the country , but they were not informed about the exact time and the places .
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
The police told their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings and airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
In Thailand , there are still small bomb attacks , but most of them are not directed against tourists .
In Hua Hin is a palace that has been used for years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
After the current bomb explosions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to comply with the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
High security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings .
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need to travel to these provinces .
Increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applied to the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta .
This will give the military a great deal of influence over the next few years .
Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to stifle chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
The military unta , which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , considers itself to have been able to bring the kingdom back to stability and order .
However , the military has not been able to cope with the insurgency of Muslim rebels who have been living in the extreme south of the country for years .
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
Almost a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists .
It was the most bloody attack on the country 's recent history .

England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London , but throughout the country .
For me , this was the biggest attraction on the right side , just as in London in 2012 , when we did a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End .
And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to Heathrow .
For our local communities , we will already create 10 000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too big .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage .
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcoming , but Heathrow answers every question he raises .
Like the Olympic Games , Heathrow is for many , and not for individual , an infrastructure project .
Enlargement is one way to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £211 billion of growth and a legacy of skills and employment , both at the airport and in the UK .
We have a great team at Heathrow , which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - five years as a result of the world 's best airport terminal , up to T2 , built in the middle of the world 's two most frequented runways .
Now they are ready to deliver a third run , which is supported by £16 billion in private investment .
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , thereby safeguarding our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury

The SPD and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believe that , in future , investors should be made much more accountable .
How do we react to the bad news that , in the next few years , Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments ?
The SPD proposes a `` concept of action '' for the next Council meeting .
But dispute is programmed .
First of all , the question is : Who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
There is no regulation until now .
SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann argues : `` We are in agreement with the Greens : Those who want to build on urban areas will have to designate 20 % of all housing as social housing in the future . ''
However , the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock .
However , the big point in the city hall is : `` How to deal with investors who want to build on private land ? ''
`` We want investors to build at least 10 % on such land , but as 20 per cent of housing as social housing . ''
A new urban housing support programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is intended to provide incentives .
The problem , Mr Bratmann , said : `` There is currently no agreement between the groups . ''
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors .
The Left intends to impose even tougher constraints on investors .
Despite this , Mr Bratmann , the situation is worsening in the housing market .
If the concept of action is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
More staff will be needed .
It is unclear whether we will get the workers .
But the programme is not complete : The around 1260 new apartments , which should be built in any case .
But how do we compensate for the loss of a further 1300 favourable housing , which will be phased out in the next few years ?
It will be 500 homes by 2020 alone .
In order to prevent this , the planned spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city .
Moreover , thought should be given to bringing back homes back to price fixing .
This is possible in the west city .
The problem could be dealt with at a stroke .
This is because , in the West City , deadlines expire at the end of the year .
Around 1800 apartments could be found there back in the price fixing for cheap apartments .
Only the owners , the housing companies , do not want that .
If there is a dramatic increase in the number of social housing in the Western City , the aim of the so-called 'mix ' will be removed .
A concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city should no longer exist .
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the debate .
Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke argues : `` For a broad majority , the CDU must be in the boat . ''
This has focused on more building sites for single-family houses .
But what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .

Berlin/Schwerin : Survey against Rural elections : SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the Länder of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the government parties to the SPD and CDU groups are emerging .
This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the `` Picture '' newspaper ( Friday ) .
While the red-black government coalition in the North could continue to govern narrowly , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
In both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to head the head of the government .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 35.6 % five years ago to 24 per cent .
According to the survey , the party would only be close to the CDU , which could come back to 23 % .
The third place is controversial between the Left and the AfD .
The left would be 19 % ( previously 18.4 % ) , the AfD would be represented at 19 % for the first time in the country .
In spite of a slight loss of 6 % ( previously 8.7 % ) , the Greens were reluctant to return to the Schwerin Landtag .
NPD and FDP would not be represented at 3 % in the country of the country .
According to the Berlin Chamber of Deputies , the SPD of the survey would be only 23 % ( election in 2011 : 28.3 % ) .
The CDU reached only 18 % after 23.4 % .
As a result , it would be 19 % ( 17.6 % in 2011 ) , but before the left with 15 % ( previously 11.7 % ) .
The AfD would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies .
With 5 % , the FDP could hope for a return , but the pirates would miss out in 2011 .

Asocial family destroys social housing in Saltash , Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a delogation of £50,000 , because they terrorized their neighbors .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash , Cornwall .
After they were forcibly removed from their property , shocked employees of the Housing Cooperatives found property in an irreparable state of affairs .
The walls had clad holes , wooden panels were thrown up , rubbish was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was reduced to the walls .
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that it now lives in a private housing
Donna McEvoy , who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
She said : `` It was an absolute nightmare for people here , and I believe that people do not have to live in this way .
There are many things to take into account , as this property will probably be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwall .
The family is notorious and its reputation is also known .
The couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police said that the terror inflicted on the family , street battles with baseball clubs , intimidation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive cries , disputes and flights .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the rental contract , received an order for antisocial behavior in June .
In some of the premises of the House which will be torn down , old garbage has been found
In the property in which drugs were traded in the past , the wood panels were opened up
Neighbors said that they had to fight them on the street and called on the police to be called on a regular basis .
Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily .
The delogation has been applauded by facilitated neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell .
One said : `` They did n't care about anyone . ''
We lived for 20 years besides them and it was always bad .
The countless times we are saying to the police are incredible .
`` We could not sleep this morning . ''
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed !
Now that they are at last , it will be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities .
The family lived in the house at which the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years
Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the municipal house .
He added : `` It is a disgrace that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , since a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account .
This was a very difficult case , because the behaviour had been extreme and that their actions had to be terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work done by my team , the police of Devon and Cornwall , as well as members of the community who have been courageous and have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and will send the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they are all over 20 .
A single mattress left on the floor in one of the house 's bedrooms after delogation
Household management workers will now have to remove rubbish mountains surrounded by the house
In 2014 the police carried out a Razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales , parapaphernals and cash amounting to £1,700 .
Skeldon received a fine after she found himself guilty of the possession of a class B drug .
She claimed that the money was a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
After they were absent , Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
Many of the room 's walls were painted with graffiti .
The police says that it will delogate tenants that do not comply with the domestic order
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not keep to the house code .
`` This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-charge and those who have been harmed by such behavior , '' she said .
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Olympia 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first cases of doping
Caught : Due to a positive doping test , the weight of Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are being overshadowed by the first official doping cases .
A hit athlete would have won almost one medal .
Before the seventh competition day , the first official instances of doping have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
The Chinese swimmers , Chen Xinyi , 3000-meter-obstacle runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight holder Adrian Zielinski have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critical athletics competitions , these messages come to a time of time .
In the case of Chen , the diuretics of Hydrochlorothiazid was already proven last Sunday , which is being used as a masking tool for doping substances .
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
On Sunday the 18-year-old had occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only by 0.09 seconds they missed the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen would have attended the courses over 50 m free style .
At the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , Chen asked for the opening of the B-sample and a hearing .
The national federation takes the matter `` very seriously and demands from Chen full cooperation in the investigations , '' quoted Xinhua from a communication : `` We will cooperate with the International Court of Sport CAS and will accept the judgment . ''
For the first time in history , the IOC , but the CAS , is responsible for the sanctioning of sportsmen and women .
Also in the night of Rio , the news of the positive test at Danekova leaked through , the 33-year-old went on to the offensive .
`` I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , '' she said `` an incredible shock , '' she said to the Bulgarian TV BNT .
She was innocent , `` the only explanation could be food supplements , '' said the athlete .
According to the report , the banned substance is EPO .
Danekova has been suspended for the time being , according to BNT , the B-sample should also have been positive .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister , Bojko Borissow , responded promptly with criticism of the athlete .
`` I do not understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , '' he said : `` We Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . ''
For example , all weights from the chronically tracted nation must not take part in Rio .
On Friday was also known the case `` Adrian Zielinski , '' the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tomasz , three days earlier , tested positively on the anabole steroid Nandrolon .
Both of them do not take the dose , but they can not start in the class up to 94 kg .
In particular , the Danekova case is another major blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
The World Federation of IAAF prohibited the complete Russian team , except for an exception because of systematic dopings , and the release of Kenya also produced numerous bad news in Rio .
In the swimming sport , the earlier crimes in China had also caused a great deal of controversy among athletes .
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly .
`` Sun Yang pinkelt lila . ''
`` If I see the podium over 200 m of free style , I will go hand in hand , '' said Lacourt on the French radio .
Sun was also at the heart of a dispute with the Australians Mack Horton .
`` I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters , '' he said .
Sun was positively tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 , but had to sit down only for three months .

Councillors strike : Demands for new industrial action measures
The representatives of the assistants have called on their trade unions to approve new industrial disputes in their disputes regarding a new Treaty .
The Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has asked its entire Council to approve more industrial action measures from the beginning of September .
The JDC said that it had failed ministers to respond to the concerns of the Treaty .
Assistant doctors and medical students have voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with BMA .
It was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had `` persistently calm '' problems , leading to the rejection of the Treaty .
She said : `` In light of this , the JDC has voted to fully reject the proposed new Treaty and have requested official renegotiations on all of your concerns . ''
In response to the government 's silence , the JDC has today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action that begins at the beginning of September .
The disputes resulted in the fact that assistant doctors this year razed six , the first total defaults in the history of the NHS .
The head of the BMA assistant physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA .
He informed BMA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54.000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted .
After the vote , the Minister for Health , Jeremy Hunt , said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced .

Military leadership distorts ISIS intelligence information , closes Congress Committee
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to make a more optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than to allow the actual situation on the ground , a committee of inquiry in the Congress in a report on Thursday .
The preliminary report , drawn up by a task force of Republican members of the forces of the military , intelligence and the military budget , reports of great dissatisfaction under Central Command 's intelligence analysts , who reported how its assessments were changed to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
The Central Command , in short Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` According to information typically sent out by High Level CENTCOM Commandeuren , a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual situation on the ground had allowed , and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , '' a newspaper article quoted the report .
`` What happened at the CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , '' said Ken Calvert , Republican member of the House of Representatives .
The management errors in the CENTCOM range to the top of the organization .
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
Although there is no direct reference to the fact that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts have been exposed to the pressures of their superiors , a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State 's threat , known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` In the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements prior to Congress were much more positive than the facts , '' said the report .
For example , a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mossul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
`` After months of investigations , so much is clear . '' said Mike Pompeo , Republican congressman from Kansas , in an opinion .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command 's heads changed the intelligence reports to downplay the risk of ISIS in Iraq .
The Republicans set up the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation continues .
In addition , further investigation of the CENTCOM reports by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence is underway .
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday , which agreed with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions .
`` In the years 2014 and 2015 , the CENTCOM created an excessively limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services , '' said the supreme democrat in the Committee , a member of the House of Representatives , Adam B. ship , in an opinion .
This process , according to Mr. ship , `` delayed the publication of intelligence reports , '' damaged the morality among analysts and `` gave excessively little room for dissent . ''
But Mr. ship and the Democrats said that there was no evidence of the White House 's intervention in the CENTCOM analyst in terms of a `` certain political opinion . ''
The preliminary findings of the Congress 's investigation were published on Tuesday by `` The Daily Beast . ''
Last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon 's General Inspector , who received the complaints from CENTCOM analysts .
Mr. Patrick Evans , a spokesman for the Pentagon , stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports from the Congress , while the investigation by the General Inspectorate was still underway .
But he also acknowledged that `` experts sometimes have different opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial debate on these important issues of national defense . ''
The investigation has repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
However , the allegations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago , when a CENTCOM analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a document about how George W. Bush 's then government , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , saw only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State .
Last year , the team around Mr. Hooker , according to government offices , noted that , contrary to the government 's statements , airstrikes against the Islamic State 's refineries would not have significant effects on the financial position of the terrorist group , as these provisional refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
However , this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September .
Centcom 's former commander , Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing in the Senate .
General Austin was retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Joseph L. Votel .

The Enforcement Trailer
Germany 's Raser has to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : In various states , among others in Hesse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested to transfer the Temposunder in a particularly effective way .
The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden may , for example , be used in areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
For example , there are no necessary infrastructure to ensure the compliance with speed limits , for example , on motorway construction sites or on renovating bridges with temporary temples .
However , a mobile device can be too dangerous or cumbersome .
The Enforcement Trailer is autark : Its battery holds five days at uninterrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
With laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be detected at the same time across several tracks .
Variable speed limits as well as driving bans after time , driving strips and vehicle classes can also be monitored .
It is possible to move the trailer in a highly-driven condition , according to the manufacturer , with each car with trailer clutch .
So that it is not easy to clamp down , it is reduced in the measurement operation , so that the wheels disappear in the armored and , by the way , even smoother outer shell .
In addition , a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the blouse from vandalism .
Since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic in various federal countries and has now been used .
Also foreign authorities are blessing with the new technology : Recently France has ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces over the past year .

Condoms with chilipudes , fireworks promote dance anias elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into settlements inhabited by people - they throw condoms on them that are filled with Chilipuder .
The method has proved effective , and the Honeyguide Foundation , which had the idea already years ago , has stepped up its promotion , along with US natural protection , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without violating animals .
Previously , many spears used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Call Day dedicated to animal welfare .
`` Since we have developed the ... toolkit , we have seen a change in their attitude within these communities , while they are much more confident that they can dissuade the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant , '' said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication .
The first two steps include the lights of the elephant with a torch and the bladder in a horn .
If it is not scared , a so-called `` Chilicloud '' will be thrown .
Chilipuder mixed with earth , combined with a firework body in a condom , the end of which is turned into the ignition .
When it is lit , the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on Chilipuder in the air .
A hint is usually already out to chase the elephant .
One last option is a Werfer , who is shooting a gold fire in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

Haigerloch : Pilgrims to the mercy of mercy
The Ministrants from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg .
Four stages have been taken together .
In order to bridge the period until the next visit of all Ministrants in two years , the Oberministrantenround St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage tour .
Various pilgrimage goals have been examined and one has finally decided for the Bishop city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy , a special pilgrimage goal was offered with the opening of the Barm cordial at Freiburger Münster .
16 Minis from Bittelbronn , Gruol , Haigerloch and Heiligenrooms were on the way .
In the evening , Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and gave the pilgrims .
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen , where there was also a Münster Unserer Lieben woman and thus became the Pilgerweg of Münster .
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
At the same time , the Minis went back to the field cruises , chapels , or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrimage settlement .
The local parishes were made available for the overnight stays .
At the stages , Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller served for a tasty as well as a delicious dinner and breakfast .
On the second day we went to Gütenbach .
At the end of the day , the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhausting route , had to be climbed up to about 500 metres in the heat of the heat and then again .
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the beach in the evening .
After the morning impulses on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg .
Obviously , the Minis met at Freiburger Münster later in the afternoon and went through the doors of mercy .
With a small impulse , God was thanked here .
In the evening fair in Münster , the Minis of Cooperative Markus Obert was welcomed at the pilgrimage destination .
After the worship , the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar .
The next day was still time for the latitude metropolis .
In the afternoon it went back by train to Horb .
In the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .

Old buildings , a few of the Linden trees , are still one of the remaining cobblestones : The Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight , but the police are one of the `` dangerous places '' of the city .
If you go down the road from east to west , you can get to the playgrounds , a playful kindergarten and a biolade .
At the façade of a grey house , someone has screened `` ugly ! . ''
In comparison with a Lidl , which will soon be demolished , it is already being built : Until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created .
Articles about this `` trendy quarter , '' as the real estate company Friedrichshain calls , are , however , favored in the last few weeks with burning cars .
The reason is the house with the number 94 : Once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rent contracts , on the ground floor are still spaces and are used for events .
Since the beginning of the year , Berlin 's internal senator Henkel , in particular , has argued for a hard work by the police against the project , the area as a `` no-go zone '' for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence .
On 22 June , the ground floor , the cadtersmiths , with 300 police officers , patrolled the police for three weeks , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the ground , closed sections of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
On behalf of the unknown homeowners , renovated construction workers are the rooms .
On 13 July , a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers withdrew from the jewel of sympathizers and residents .
On this summer afternoon , the street works peacefully : Parents walk with children , people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about the Späti .
A primary school and kindergartens are located close to the house projects .
The left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in the Kiev since 1999 , and Jana * , who attracts three children here , are mainly genervated by the police presence .
With the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising rents and ginging .
It does not sound like a Kiez , the majority of which wanted police protection against vaulting left .
The ditch that the Berlin interior senator and the police place between squatters and their neighbours does not seem to exist .
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter , which also has a low average income and high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
There are also domestic occupations and the ensuing housing projects have been part of Kiev for a long time : In 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainzer street close to the Rigaer .
While the maintainers had been evacuated under great police coverage in a regular street slaughter , many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago .
At the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world over the past few years : People from DDR times and former squatters are now sharing their sights with them .
This also applies to the rental companies , which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are under attack as symbols of this development : They can be seen on the inserted windows or freshly painted facades which have been thrown with colour bags .
No other road was mentioned this year so often with the words `` linksautonomous violence . ''
One reason why not all the neighbours consider this to be a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : Crimes such as personal injury are reported almost exclusively to police officers .
The biggest part of the crime is the damage to property , which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
As far as violence is concerned , it is appeasement : The people in the 94 are their neighbours , who have certainly not been .
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer .
For the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : `` Here you can help each other , live together on the road and get more from each other than elsewhere . ''
Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Street - and remained .
That is why it was so important that the residents should get back to their streets : From the police , politics and the media , who , in July , all suddenly claimed the sovereignty of the area .
But , in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer , the road continues to be taken away from them : Through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps , which are pushing the old inhabitants .
`` These are , after all , condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so good , '' she says .
`` I absolutely can not approve of violence and destruction . ''
But what should be done if someone is never listening to someone ?
There is frustration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
For those who are annoyed by color bombs , Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding : The house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez .
If you prefer , you should be aware of this - just as someone dragging into a pub district can complain about noise there .
All those who have only been given first names have asked not to be called by their proper name .

NASA climate model : Venus was previously habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was likely to be habitable .
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
The model has been designed to determine whether Venus , with its hot , waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere , could have pointed out similar conditions .
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , erdlike atmosphere , yet slowly moving .
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus .
The planet was likely to have more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and to protect it from rapid evaporation .
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 % matter .
`` In the GISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exposes their daily side of the sun for almost two months , '' said Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release .
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun 's heat .
The result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today .
The model brought forth a history of Venus , which is similar to the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers .
Although it was likely to be habitable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years -- has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light .
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burnt away from the ultraviolet light .
When their hydrogen was removed , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Klimamodells in Geophysical Research Letters .

Data klau : So perfide hackers are exposing their ransom .
Programmers are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
According to a recent survey by the Malware-Defense Specialist Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the companies surveyed were at least once , sometimes several times , victims of an attack with blackmail software .
In Germany , almost 20 % of firms were already the target of a ransomware blackmail .
40 % of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the systems and data that are under attack .
According to the observations of Malwarebytes , the perpetrators specialize in attacks on company networks according to the observations of Malwarebytes .
If they are successful there , the potentially blackmailing ransom field is significantly higher than for private users .
`` We are witnessing a frightening rapid evolution of the malware , '' explained Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the `` World . ''
In 2008 , most malware programs were designed to send advertising .
Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves .
Only private users were the target , but the changeover to company attacks took place at a frightening pace over the past few months .
Ransomware works on a simple pattern : Once on a victim 's computer , it is looking for newly modified files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the original .
Then the software presents the demands of the blackmailers .
In order to get the final code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin .
However , where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , companies are involved in sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is closed .
As a result , the damage occurs when a ransomware is added .
22 percent of the German companies affected reported loss of revenue through Ransomware , 13 percent even had to interrupt the business completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
In Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be seriously threatened by the loss of health records .
`` We always say to the victims : Does not pay , it only promotes the problem , '' says Kleczynski .
But 80 to 90 % of the companies that pay will get their data again .
For managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill .
Hackers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , the security researchers of F-Secure investigated the user interface and contacts with the blackmailers and come to the result : The perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
They explain to their victims through chat , how they can pay by bitcoin , set freely accessible support sites or unlock example files for free .
And if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros , companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to recover their data unencrypted .
In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail , hackers are increasingly professional and share the work , explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos : `` A single person can write a Ransomware about within a week . ''
However , it is more likely that there are three or four people .
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building block to the actual blackmailers .
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware themselves , advice , and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
`` The scope of delivery is an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and branding can be changed , '' says Wisniewski .
The blackmailers are looking for more hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
So you can login in one of the subground forums , buy the set of a criminal and charge another to install the software to as many PCs as possible .
Payment is per infected machine .
`` usually the criminals then recruit spammers with the spread , '' says Wisniewski .
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data .
More than 50 percent of the company 's IT managers in the Malwarebytes-survey trust to be able to ward off Ransomware by means of file backups and scanner software .
As a result , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
`` If the encryption of data is not a sufficient threat to successful testing alone , the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , '' explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski .
Thus , the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is even higher than before .
In the future , the perpetrators could also take completely new objectives on the Internet of things .
At the hacker conference Defcon , security researchers demonstrated how they were able to control a thermostat connected to the Internet .
In the middle of the winter , the opening of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom .
If , instead of heating in the future , the perpetrators block a whole production line in a factory , Ransomware could also become a subject in industry 4.0 .

Police forces tears and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students
Students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday , when they gathered together to demonstrate the government 's reform of the public education system .
The police set up tears and rubber bullets against the demonstrators .
The difficulties began when police officers tried to divide the students , leading the police to implement rubber bullets and tear gas .
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their consternation about the plans .
According to the board of governors of the federal state of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money .
Some of the Protestants saw graffiti against the temporary president , Michel Temer , on walls .
The recent protests occurred several days after demonstrators were on the streets in order to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .

Trump does not see the looming electoral defeat so narrow
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
If there is nothing about the election to the US President , Donald Trump already has an alternative video .
He then goes on on holiday .
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November , he would be relatively indifferent : `` In the end , it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , '' said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the US TV station CNBC .
If it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , Trump said .
For example , he called US President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the Islamic State of Islamic State ( ISIS ) .
Within his party , more and more resistance emerged .
#doc#
Donald Trump declared Obama 's assertion that ISIS was `` sarcasm ''
Donald J. Trump , on Friday , tried to dispel the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by claiming that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton was the `` founder '' of the Islamic State 's terrorist group was not serious .
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate , whether it was clear and comprehensible to communicate with the American public .
It also brings his colleagues , who are trying to protect him during an eventful period , in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all .
Having made the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Trump resisted the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS .
But , in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said that he was simply sarcastic .
The Tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was very serious about the accusation .
When the conservative radio station , Hugh Heaten , wanted to help Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
The last storm of criticism crashed on Mr. Trump , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling surveys .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the state of the state in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue .
On Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has already put sarcasm at his defense .
At the end of July , he received strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but later he said `` Of course , I thought the sarcastic . ''
This method allows Mr. Trump to defer the linguistic limits in politics and then go back to need .
`` I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then , if necessary , `` to make clear , depending on what the response is , '' said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates .
But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
Rather than defying the tone for the presidential election , Trump has adopted an even more negative tone , as its survey values have continued to decline .
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist , published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-head race in Florida .
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements , he often accuses his critics of distorting what he says or misunderstand his humor .
But , while he has stepped up the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's Scherze has brought his loyal colleagues into the uncompromisable situation of having to face him , no matter how provocative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , former Mayor of New York and one of Trump 's most prominent princes , took great trouble to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday .
`` I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , '' Mr. Giuliani said about the accuracy of Mr. Trump 's statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State .
It is true , in this sense , that before Obama , ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back brokers , completely wrong , and so it happened because it withdrew the troops from Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed ISIS to spread out by failing to control the situation in the Middle East aggressively .
Prior to the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being slandered and biased on each of his words .
He mocked the `` poor , pitiful '' television experts who try to understand it and said 'You can not do it ! ' .
Some of the Democrats mocked about Mr. Trump 's excuse as yet another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency .

Purchasers in Primark outraged about women who are shamelessly tried in the shop
The buyers did not know where they should go , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a Primart to try underhoses .
In order to exacerbate the situation , it was mustening it , as it looked at it , and put it back into the shelf .
She went further and tried four pairs of Unterhosen in a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone .
The Primark shop in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone , where the woman tried the underhoses before she put it back into the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was at the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , `` she went back and left the shop without buying anything . ''
She said : `` People could not believe what they saw . ''
In the middle of the sales area she took a pair of underwear out of the outlay , pulled her own tights and trousers and tried her .
`` It did n't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - it was simply there , frech as Oskar . ''
`` Everyone starred when she withdrew the underhoses , who apparently did not like it , as she put it back into the shelf . ''
She repeated the same with three other underhoses before she finally decided that she had not liked anything , went back and went out .
`` They did not seem to disrupt it , that they watched someone - or think about the person who , in some circumstances , would buy the underhoses that it had tried to do . ''
Mrs Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : `` How reluctant to think that someone would take home who had had another person and who were not washed . ''
The event occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs Davidson added : `` As I have heard , the employees have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . ''
`` I would hate to go home with a new pair of underhoses and find out that another woman had her and withdrew her and she was not washed . ''
A spokesman of Primark said : `` Primark is the event that took place on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folkstone . ''
All products in question were withdrawn from the sale .

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is a new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer .
She is also a social worker on the ground .
Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach .
The social pedagogy supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger .
It sees itself as a contact for all actors : Refugees , refugee aid , administration , public authorities , and anyone else .
Regine customer of the working group suggests that the honorary official is more than grateful that Deuschle is now there , the eierlegende Wollmilchsau , which mainly has a problem .
For example , some were referring to the multiplicity of tasks that were needed , rather than the administration , when the administration wanted to write out the job .
An administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience of social work , has been sought , just as a ferocious Wollmilchsau .
But administrative work is not their central area , says Annika Deuschle .
Above all , it is about organisation , work with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes and network activity .
The 31-year-old has been doing so for about six weeks .
It has limited a 50 percentage point to three years .
`` It was high time , '' says Regine customer , that Annika Deuschle supports honest and main actors .
There are large and small problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
New containers will soon be available on Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been going on for some time now to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised .
The municipalities are responsible for connecting services .
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes .
The costs of building , renting or renovating these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the Landscape to Kommune and Jobcenter .
Problem : There are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
The search has been very difficult for some time .
De facto , the administration does not find private homes .
So far , it does not work , with the need for private housing , such as Deuschle .
Therefore , public housing needs to be caught up , as it is so beautiful .
So new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße .
But only with housing is it not done .
Perspective is the keyword , Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a fixed lead , there are traineeships , training places , school places , one-euro jobs and training for refugees and migrants who need to be funded or set up .
`` More seats would be good , '' says Regine customer .
Many work in the Bauhof or help homemasters , do not-for-profit work - and this is motivated and very orderly , as Annika Deuschle reports .
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
That is `` no employment therapy . ''
But work does not only mean work .
The day needs a fixed structure , say Deuschle and customer .
People would have to develop a sense of belonging .
So it needs offers like sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
Professional courses are rar .
So , here too , there is administration and honorary official .
It is crucial that the refugees feel that they are wanted and welcome in Germany .
The long duration of the procedures is a problem .
They need to explain to the refugees that it will take time and that they will be able to bridge the time , for example with language courses .
Anyone who develops the feeling that he can not help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless , who will never be able to integrate himself .
The clear majority was motivated .
The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others .
All this is a `` mammoth task . ''
A difficult question : After the recent events , are the two afraid of radicalization , including in a small community like Urbach ?
`` No , '' says Regine customer very clearly , `` what some may call naïve , '' but it can not and do not preclude a balance of risk .
However , the volunteers are already aware of this .
These incidents are also issues for the refugees .
They are afraid that the attackers are making them completely discredited .
`` They want to show that they have nothing to do , '' says Regine customer .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
In other words , local and local volunteers must look out for activities in the region .
They have always been in the background that a new blow could soon come to refugees and migrants to Urbach .
Does Germany need a ceiling ?
To give a clear answer to this question is the policy .
In fact , it is unfair to place them on the spot .
`` In Urbach we have not yet arrived at where we want to go , '' says Annika Deuschle .
No new refugees would relax the situation .
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already been used to integrate the previous people wisely .
These are about 100 people , mostly young men .
But if people in need are in need , they must be helped , both women agree .
The political world is so complicated , there are no easy answers .

A controversial Baseball Star
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US aseball star in best days from Base to Base .
After his emotional resignation announcement , the 41 year old Profi will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on the 12th of August against the Tampa Bay Rays .
`` I love this game and this team . ''
`` I say 'Goodbye ' to join , '' said the 14-time All-Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Three times , Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signature under a ten-year contract awarded him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will be an advisor and youth coach in the future .
As a player , Rodriguez spent a long time with performance .
With 696 Homeruns , 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( `` Runs '' ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones .
With Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two other baseball players , Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , have similar values .
However , the 41-year-old should not be included in the rest hall of the baseball .
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname `` A-Rod '' - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place .
As early as 2009 , the superstar at `` ESPN '' admitted that steroids were prohibited between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 , by the end of 2014 , it was blocked for 211 games due to an involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect to have received performance-related funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida .
After a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
`` The league could even have done me a favour for 2014 , because I have been playing through 20 years without pause , '' said Rodriguez at the time .
Even his farewell days are not silent .
While many baseball legends in their last games once again received the big stage , Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench .
`` My job does not include a farewell tour . ''
`` My job involves trying to win each game , '' said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married with the actress Cameron Diaz and followed the conditions with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Yankee-Archrival Boston Red Sox .
`` We want A-Rod , '' the supporters sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

Olympia : Three cases of fraud in the case of doping
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya 's athlete faces the Second World War of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemach .
After an attempt to combat doping in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach to the home .
The International Olympic Committee agreed to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
A Kenyan functionary had announced that the former sprinter and today Coach , John Anzrah , had made a urine sample at the Olympic village under the name of the 800-Meter farmer Ferguson Rotich .
This has been reported to Kenya 's team management from the monitoring agencies .
The International Federation of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to make its own investigations , an IAAF spokesperson informed .
`` According to the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IAAF will carry out an assessment , '' said an ILO declaration .
`` He ( Anzrah ) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich , the sample and signed , '' said Kenya 's head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi .
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency .
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
Four days earlier , the Kenyan athletic delegate , Michael Rotich , had been removed from the Rio Games .
He is supposed to have informed the country 's sportsmen and women of upcoming doping tests .
According to media reports , he should have been arrested on his return to Nairobi Airport .
Kenya stands at the IOC for a long time and has been under special observation for a long time .
In the announcement of the IOC 's more than 2000 doping targets in the run-up to the Rio Games , it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a great deal of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system .
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
As a result , WADA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose fight against doping is consistent with the rules of WADA .
Kenya is regarded as a great lender nation .
The country 's athletics won most medals during the 2015 World Championship in Beijing .
In a number of television reports of the ARD , allegations have repeatedly been made that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mindset of sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had done in Russian athletics .
It has been shown that in this sport , there has been a widespread and systematic use of this type of sport .
Russia 's athletics were then excluded from the summer games .

Cats respond more sensibly to the cries of young animals
Biologists have studied in Hanover the effect of the use of cat babys on adult animals .
For her surprise , the manches did n't make cold - but they were always the same in contrast to the females .
Female cats can recognize the degree of irritation of cat babys on the small ones .
They react by ten per cent faster on the lute of kitchens , which are in great distress , as scientists have discovered from the Veterinary Office of Applied Sciences and the Medical University of Hanover ( MHH ) .
Kater is also responding to the demands of kitchens - but always the same .
The biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH , said the biologist Wiebke Konerding said .
She is the author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine `` BMC evoluutionary Biology . ''
In a previous investigation , the research team had already discovered that the length and pitch of the kittens cries is different with the urgency of their need for assistance .
A total of nine adult katers and eight female animal husbands have been observed .
They were played by small ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings .
On the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more erred kitchens , which were raised in addition .
Researchers consider their results to be significant despite the low sample .
`` All females , even those who have not yet had their own children , reacted differently to the cries , '' said Konerding .
They turned faster to the loudspeaker , when the cry of the more mature kittens played out .
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity .
`` One surprise was that the males have reacted at all , '' said the biologist .
In the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises .
Some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to babies , whether they were already mothers or not , the biologist Marina Scheumann reported .

Kepler attaches the rotation rate of stars to the star clusters of the plejades .
The latest mission with the Kepler Space telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates under the stars of the plejades .
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the star clusters rotate to different levels , and in what context the rotation periods are associated with the planetary development .
`` We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , '' said Luisa Rebull , a researcher at Caltech 's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The star cluster of the plejades is 445 light years away from Earth .
Many stars in this star cluster , created around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adulthood .
They are now the fastest .
At peak rotational rates , these ripening stars attract large numbers of star winds .
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
When a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sunspots -- .
The latest catalogue of rotational rates points out that more solid stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , while larger stars turn slower pirouettes than smaller ones .
`` In the `` Ballet '' of the plejades , we see that slow rotors tend to be massive , whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars , '' said Rebull .
Since the star cluster of the plejades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
`` The star clusters of the plejades offer an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , '' said Rebull .
There is still a lot ahead of us to learn about how , how , how , when and why stars slow down their rates of rotation and , so to speak , hang their `` dance shoes . ''
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the plejades , which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal .

The future of Portland 's melting pot due to the lifting of the energy contract
The future of Portland 's aluminium melting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
This was followed by the decision of the Government in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November .
Up to 2000 jobs in Alcoa 's plant in Portland are at stake .
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
Moreover , it could lead to domino effects , as the melting process consumes around 10 % of the total power generation of Victorias .
In 2014 , Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzerei , which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alcoa 's melting pot in Portland loses money and risks closing down .
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and , most recently , the electricity price for the plant .
AGL , which supplies the large aluminium melting machine with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley , announced that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts .
The plant is in the majority possession of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina , of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares .
`` AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity through melting , '' said the company .
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called `` security transactions , '' which would have been in force since November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
`` From this point of view , AGL considers that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , '' said the electricity supplier .
All potential effects on AGL revenue from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $ 187 million in `` expectation of termination . ''
Alcoa said that the decision to make the contracts , the `` ability of Alcoas ... to run the melting or the supply of electricity to the melting machine '' did not affect .
The US company said that it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which should have entered into force in November this year , even if it is still guilty of a declaration of why it has resigned from the Treaty .
As a result of the bad economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle .
In reference to the analysts ' statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity annually .
If both units disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [ electricity market ] .
And for us , as electricity producer , it would not be good , '' he said .

Intercultural journey : Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the Forest School visited the play `` The invisible house . ''
The club NIMA 's and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
The association NIMA 's enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
The `` Class International '' of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended an idea of the award winning piece `` Das invisible Haus '' of the Young Theater Münster .
In the context of the `` Intercultural journey '' initiated by the association NIMA 's , 19 students visited between eleven and 15 years the staging in the small house .
Since the beginning of the year the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
Most young people in the class had come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia , and Syria .
Thanks to the choreographies , the scenical images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
The club NIMA 's , founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel , and the Young Theater will work in the next season in the context of a music theater-project .
From October to December , young people with and without a flight and migration background should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , play and music .
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
The `` Intercultural journey '' project continues .
In view of the increased numbers of refugees , the club expects many classes that want to participate .

Jewish director has broken Berlin 's hotel because Israeli pre-election has been removed from the `` Arab '' call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media rebellion after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-election , as it had `` requested '' Arab guests `` requested . ''
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentary `` Shoah '' caused his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ .
During his last stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel 's list of countries .
However , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
Wrote Lanzmann .
Instead , the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own Call Center .
After a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The answer he received there `` shocked him , '' as Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel staff said that the measure was a `` deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotels . ''
The reason behind it was even more furious in the director .
`` The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted , '' was quoted the employee of Lanzmann .
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a `` great shame , '' reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung .
We were horrified and dismayed from this event .
That is really very shameful .
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more disgraceful .
No explanation is needed .
We expect the hotel to `` draw the right conclusions , '' said the official .
The incident caused a fairly large response on the Internet , where people called the whole affair a scandal .
Some of the people of the Kempinski Hotel said that it would `` have given way to the supposed calls of Arab guests . ''
`` Have you , '' it was said in another speech that it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm , is close to a synagogue .
The hotel quickly made all the accusations of itself and called the event a `` mistake '' and `` apologized '' at Lanzmann , reported Der Spiegel .
`` There was never a direct statement `` to not include Israel in the quicklist , '' the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesperson of the Kempinski Hotel .
It adds that the country code has now been added .

Rio 2016 : ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes Internethit
The Olympic Games or the world records do not always have the headlines at the Olympic Games .
This shows the courageous appearance of ROBEL Kiros at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
In the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight float from Ethiopia was so slow that it could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
In the social networks , Habte subsequently became a viral internethit .
In fact , the 24 year old , with a backlog of 48 seconds , finished its course and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters .
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure who drew the attention of the international media .
Why does the 24 year old take part in the Olympic Games ?
The Ethiopian got a special start law from the international swimming pool .
This is distributed in order to make swimming in under-represented countries more well-known .
As the majority of the athlete was running in the field , Habte simply wanted to do something else .
Preparation is all : ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race .
The first nicknames quickly made the round .
Some media called it `` ROBEL of the Wal . ''
The English tabloid `` The Sun '' with `` Dad Bod '' made fun of it .
His time , he only beat with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m free style , played no role here .
Comparisons with `` Eric the Eel '' were also drawn .
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the course of Eric Moussambani provided media attention .
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was an unforgettable experience , when it had to take over 100 metres of free style on its own .
Frenetically , Moussambani was fired at the time .
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

`` One generation protesting '' in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia were committed to violent resistance from the government .
Witnesses say that many protesters were killed during the clashes with the police .
Is Ethiopia going to collapse ?
Over the past decade , it has been one of Africa 's most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy .
But , in recent months , protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded in more and more areas .
Last week , thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
The government 's response was ruthless , according to human rights organisations .
Witnesses said that policemen were shot and killed on dozens of unarmed demonstrators .
In circulating videos about the protests , which are likely to be the last or the beginning of this year , show how security men beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now asking for an in-depth investigation .
`` It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , '' said Rashid Abdi , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa , and its stability is cherished by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats across the region , particularly in Somalia , with few countries in Africa , if anything , receiving so much Western assistance .
Ethiopia 's economy expanded at a considerable rate .
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa .
The streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
Although Ethiopia was far from being a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously cited oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissidents being effectively silenced .
Many were sent to exile or to prison , killed or driven into the walls of the desert .
But this could change .
`` If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , '' said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia .
All young people are protesting .
A generation is protesting .
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of land to the stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last opposition 's seat and now control 100 % of Parliament .
At the same time , the tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising ; a fight for this delicate , contentious line called for hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts fear that separatists , such as the Oromo Liberation Front , or the Ogaden 's National Liberation Front , which have been forced more or less defeated in recent years , could explode the turbulence and rearmed themselves .
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of maneuvering beneath the surface are now exploding .
The first seems to be harmless : Smart phones .
Only in recent years , many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services have improved .
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are .
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered themselves to protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since Eons , the Amharas , mostly Christian highlands , have prospered in politics and the economy , while exploiting the Oromos , many of whom are Muslims and live in lowlands .
But that , too , is changing .
`` We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella , '' said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of the Oromos .
The biggest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group , which account for around 6 % of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an unpublicised disease in 2012 .
He was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners .
Analysts say that he was particularly adept at seeing early evidence of discontent and using special envoys to process adversaries and make them harmless .
`` The current regime lacks this fundamental skill , '' said Mr Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopia 's new Prime Minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles .
Unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say that it does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray .
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a revolt was in 2005 , after thousands protested against elections , which , according to analysts , seem to have been swamped and stolen by the government .
During the following raids , many protesters were killed , even if it was less than in recent months , and this period of unrest has passed relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty .
But it is obvious that this did not prevent the Ethiopian Government 's intensification of its internal resentment .
And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month , protesters in Gondar , an amusing city , run by Tigray , and the hatred of Tigray , became increasingly common in the social media .
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position .
The American administration used Ethiopia as a base for round-the-counter flights over neighbouring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base .
While the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
`` This , '' said Mr Abdi , `` is a very thin migration . ''

£2 per day medicine , which can reduce the risk of heart attacks
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from £2-per day medicine , as recommended by the authorities to provide more people for a longer period of time .
The ginning agent Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with cardiac disease .
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke .
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the collection of fatty material in the arterial walls , which form a bellow .
When the surface is broken , it can cause a blood cloak that clots the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
If the blood cloak solves , it can flow through the bloodstream and clog blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
Ticagrelor , produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clocks less likely .
The NICE , published today , recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said : `` In spite of the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . ''
Fear of a renewed heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
Experience shows that in combination with aspirin , Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes with people who have already had a heart attack .
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor , especially the risk of blood , is limited to a period of up to three years , and the draft loan does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period .

Protecting Krav Maga against arms attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dailymail.com could make it more secure for you .
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi , a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance .
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or back , this video will show you how to rotate the spider for your robber .
If you are approaching you from the back , then you should turn around , so that you can see your attacker and `` get out of the line , '' says Mizrachi .
Take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before turning into the face with your free elbows .
Then beat him down with the knee and turn , while the attacker collapses before pain , the weapon is out of his hands .
For attackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , take the gun and turn it away , so that the attacker can not shoot .
At the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and put the gun on it .
Is it difficult ?
See the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretends .
But remember that a robbery is the safest to transfer your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master .

Clinton and Trump 's Economic Policy : It 's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and avoiding the TTP trade agreement - that is what both Clinton and Trump want .
However , the two US presidential applicants are in charge of taxation and energy policy and a fundamental issue .
The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental , rather philosophical , difference .
That , about the role of the state .
Trump is in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax and regulate the economy to death , he says .
He himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming Trump .
He will massively reduce regulations , and he is strong in favour of a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , on the other hand , says : The state has certain tasks to perform , it has the opportunity to open up , and needs money for it .
That is why taxes on the rich would be increased , says it .
Interestingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
We need to invest in this , say Trump and Clinton .
The democratic candidate has even announced the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics , and are strongly rejected by Republicans '' state critical teaky wing .
So , for Trump , party-internal discussions could come .
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-launch coal mining in the US .
Oil extraction is also expected to be possible in protected areas as well .
By contrast , Clinton wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment program : `` A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs . ''
`` It will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . ''
But , not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far from each other .
TPP , the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement , do not want to sign both .
But , at the same time , both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better .
They should then be better paid for , for example , for Clinton .
The current minimum wage of USD 7.25 is a hunger wage .
It wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not very clear : Once he says that the minimum wage must be rushed , then he says that he must not be changed .
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more about the fiscal policy of the two camps .
On the one hand , Trump is standing to ease the economy and citizens to boost growth .
His critics suggest that the budget deficit would be even bigger .
On the other hand , Clinton , who , at least , wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : More taxes are not the solution .

Illness : When the organiser pays
After their journey , sick holidaymakers will only get money if the cause of the disease is unquestionably found in the hotel .
But this is only the case when more than ten per cent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
In this case , a family was hard hit by diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of her Turkish leave .
She spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
Their illness led the holidaymakers to a defective purification plant , which was supposed to pollute the sea water .
The family was of the opinion that the journey was so flawed - and complained against the organizer .
The plaintiff had no success before the Court of First Instance .
It is true that the wastewater treatment plant was defective .
But the organizer learned of it just before the plaintiff 's departure .
He had to assume that the seawater was in order .
In other words , he did not violate his information obligations , so the verdict .
No pollution has been found in water samples .
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
Of 691 guests were only 38 .

Patrick Ferrero-Waldner resigns as trainer of Avalanche
On Thursday , Patrick began resigned as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led a too low right of co-determination in the team 's decision-making process .
Alternative President/General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will search for a new coach without delay .
`` In the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Chief trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , '' said the 50-year olds in an opinion .
In the course of the summer I have thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs it and to bring it to a higher level .
In order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organisation .
It must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the team 's performance .
These conditions are not being met at the moment .
Sakic , who had been recruited on 23 May 2013 , thanked him for his contributions to the team .
`` Patrick has informed me today about this decision , '' said Sakic .
We appreciate all what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
During his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 , he was the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league .
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesota and missed the low season in each of the last two years .
The Avalanches registered a 39-39-4 brand in the season 2015-16 and fell behind the game for a second Wildcard Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
As a hall of Fame Torwart , he won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal leagens and the Avalanche .

Political Correctness culture boosts electoral fraud in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report on corruption .
A culture of political correctness has caused widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities to be knowingly ignored , as demonstrated by a devastating government report today .
The former cabinet member , Sir Eric Pickles , speaks verbally to the police , election observers , and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of `` hypersensitivity to ethnie and religion . ''
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti-corruption king , said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish lock-outs outside of ballot boxes to protect intimidated voters .
He recommends that voters should lead a card to demonstrate their identity in elections .
At the moment , a voters must only call his name and address .
The report proposes that non-removable inks be put on the finger of a person when they vote in order to prevent someone from electing twice .
Whistleblower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
It calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non-official commentary or working groups .
`` This is not only against electoral fraud , but is also intended to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , '' he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a consequence of the Tower Hamlet electoral scandal in East London .
Last year , a special election court decided that the current mayor , Lutfur Rahman , should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
The court found that Rahman had `` cynically perverted '' the religious feelings of his Muslim community , and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia .
Rahman is supposed to `` have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . ''
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of a imitation in which one person elects as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
In particular , he expressed an alarming view of the fraudulent selection of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , drawn up , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the use of cards to demonstrate identity .
In his report , it says : 'The proof has been shown that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities , particularly women and young people , to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistani or bangling background .
`` There were concerns that ... state institutions would knowingly ignored such behavior on the basis of `` politically correct '' hypersensitivity to ethnie and religion . ''
Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban on political activists working out post-ballot papers to stop `` election harvests . ''
The report , which is being considered by Theresa May , also calls for tougher registration checks in order to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud .
Consider options to ask voters before the election after your identity .
Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from electing twice .
To carry out systematic reviews of a person 's nationality in order to ensure that they are entitled to vote .
A three-year limit to requests for automatic mail selection .
Ban on political activists working in full letter elections and envelopes .
Give the police the power to set up barriers to polling stations .
A change of law to facilitate charges of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 ( Law of the People 's Law in 1983 ) .
Ban on photography in electoral stations .
Requirement that only English should be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
Intensifying the training in order to ensure that employees get the rule that voters go to the ballot box on their own .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it `` amazing , '' that after the Tower of Hamlet , no criminal display has been filed .
`` The election court ruled Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , '' he said .
It was found guilty for a number of reasons , in accordance with the high standards of criminal law .
He also criticizes the ineffective `` Abhakchecks '' of the electoral registration departments of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : `` The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal .
Our country , as the mother of the parliaments , has a proud heritage , but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities is threatening this good reputation .

Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
With the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Levan Dzhagaryan , the volume of trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 per year .
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest on the part of Russian companies in shops in the country has increased sharply , the ambassador informed .
Russian companies take existing links with Iran , while new firms are prepared to gain access to the market .
Of course , further trade development is one of the biggest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , '' said Dzhagaryan .
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 70.9 % in the first five months of 2016 , compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 856 million .
In particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 % and amounted to $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 % to $ 158 million .
The trade recovery was achieved through deliveries of machines , trucks and weapons , '' said the ambassador .
This year Dzhagaryan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
Last year , Russian foreign representatives issued some 35,000 visas , primarily Reisevisas , to Iranian citizens .
In addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries as regards the number of tourists in Russia .
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , are broken , `` he said .
At the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes will change .
`` I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd , who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state , `` he said .

London schoolgirls who joined the ISIS were killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the ISIS , reportedly died in Syria .
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that their family heard a few weeks ago of their death in Raqqa , Syria .
It was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa , the Bollwerk of the group in the country , reported ITV News on Thursday .
He was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she claimed to leave the war-torn country and return to England .
`` One can only hope that the only good will be - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war area - to prevent people from ever taking this decision , '' said Akunjee .
In February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London stepped in a plane in the direction of Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultana 's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became the widow in a few months .

Traveller Ian Wright scaled his tongue at the dirty places of Europe for a travel guide
A British traveler underwent a serious investigation of his immune system and the wormhole - by leaving some of Europe 's dirtiest and most secretive places .
The presenter and traveler Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk , drove his course on a Euro ticket , a banker at the Piccadilly Circus , a flop of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system .
Before the end of each object , he used a luminometer to show himself and us to show what he is going to do .
But the experiment that was filmed under the title `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' brought some surprising results to light .
The idea of filling the flush of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be totally repulsive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
On his journey through Europe , Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of colorectal bacteria and his own health .
Fortunately , nothing left him , more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth .
Mr Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by riding roughshod over the world and enjoying unique and wonderful things .
From public chants to stations to flush heads of toilets , the mission has definitely put his immune system under a test
In the film he told : `` As a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film , he was in any case fair to his reputation .
The only thing he opposed was a loud public toilet in Russia .
His sample showed a luminaire number of more than 4000 units .
In comparison , the luminometers of freshly washed hands are less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to eat , after its luminometometers were more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' which shows the number of bacteria in various places such as the bathroom
In the film he says : `` That comes close to the worst thing I have in a toilet . ''
There is nothing more dirty than that !
I will do nothing about this , because it is urgent in this respect .
`` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio .
The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Battilus , which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of colorectal bacteria and the immune system .
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` We wanted to offer consumers really something new .
Something that is fascinating for viewing and , at the same time , explaining the advantages of probiotics .
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended that we said `` Let us call Ian . ''
They claim that the interest in colorectal health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to place them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of colorectal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in colorectal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom HAKALA , who directed the film , added : `` Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had leaned some of the things I ordered him to lick , like the ecelastic Russian toilet that is shown in the film . ''
Of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to try them and others where it was rather difficult .
I am glad that we have included some of these delicious leaks on film . ''
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015 , 84 % of all respondents associated with Milk acid bacteria , in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestinal and 58 percent , said that at least occasionally they use products containing attached milk-acid bacteria .

Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable .
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer , with some colleagues , was looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach .
For the 58-year old it was a premiere .
Chio : `` golden sports pyramid '' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes , the horses reminded themselves of their festivities , they woke up to the fodder in the fast Galopp home .
A kilometre at this rate , I have been afraid .
`` It was not a good experience , '' said Langer .
And then the riding career ended up again .
On Saturday , Germany 's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament wins - was back in the vicinity of horses .
He could lead his family through the installation of the ALRV , on a horse he is not even for photo purposes .
Long was the first time in Aachen and also the CHIO .
The reason was very convincing .
The German sports help presented the golden sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala .
The sympathetic sportsman does not miss out on a number of awards .
Silver Lorbeerblatt , Champions-Tour-Player of the year ...
Even the British Queen has killed him .
Long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
In Aachen , he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday .
`` This award gives me a great deal , '' says Langer , `` because it is not only awarded for sporting success , but also for social engagement . ''
For decades , Langer has been supporting the young .
And so he added the prize money of EUR 25.000 .

One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything : A little SUV , a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan .
Sounds rather overloaded , but the HR-V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
Although the HR-V , which is only 1.60 m high , is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and the rear , it does not work closely .
The materials of the interior are well processed and are pleasant , but only the cockpit top has something to do .
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
It is not only a bounce room of 453 litres at high level and 1026 l. It is available at the same time as the `` Magic Seats '' and the `` Magic Seats . ''
This is less magic than it sounds : The seat of the back bank can be folded up like a child 's boiler and thus offer storage space , which is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling .
The boot room can be loaded well , but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
The tested 1.6-l-Diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
However , he is expected to do his work more quietly .
The daily consumption of 4,7 l/100 km is gratifying .
There is another motorisation : A 1,5-l-Benziner with 96 kW / 130 hp .
An all-wheel drive is not offered .
Driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamism and comfort .
But the governance should be a little more direct .
The equipment in the top version of `` Executive '' does not leave any wishes open .
Security systems include the city emergency brake assistant ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the track record assistant .
The collision warner sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as `` approaching objects . ''
The remote light assistant works very reliably .
And the intelligent Temporegler responds to the traffic sign detection and reduces the speed when required .
Full connectivity is available only for the top level : 7-inch touchscreen , Navi , App-Integration and more .
Two USB and one HDMI connector are under the armrest and are therefore to be achieved in a cumbersome way .
The around 29000 euros for the well equipped top diesel are in order .
If you do n't want to invest so much , you will receive the gasoline from €20000 , the Diesel from 23000 euros .
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard .
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and all-day car .

Last month Gibson took part in a physical dispute on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a joint statement his dismissal .

Despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fierce
In spite of his disappointing appearance in the Olympic timescale , he does not want to allow himself to be undermined .
`` I continue to keep the World Championships in view , remain confident and continue to fight , '' wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place in the sugar hat .
`` I really find it hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , '' Martin said .
He must analyse in calmness the reasons for the debacle .
At the time of the 2010 World Cup in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
`` I will look carefully at what we have changed in recent times . ''
`` This includes my position , '' wrote the three-time world champion , who had lost on Wednesday to the 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara ( Switzerland ) .

Local law centres provide 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the country 's assistance needs are rejected annually by local authorities , while the industry is looking at the effects of further budget cuts on already congested transactions .
In Queensland , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence , and those who do not have funds for unjust delogations and the like - are already dismissed in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
Legal services of the municipality , which are already excessive , are prepared for further cuts .
As from June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 % of their federal funds .
The director of the district legal centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last collection of the National Association of Local Law Centres showed that thousands of people are already dismissed each year .
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the decision of the Federal Government .
`` Queensland 's municipal law centres are chronically underfunded , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services that you need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relations , people with insurmountable and suffocating debts , families who go through separations , workers who are unfairly laid off - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need .
The Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 % from June 2017 , which means that thousands of people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
We call on the General Public Prosecutor and the Federal Justice Minister , as well as Senators from Queensland George Brandis , to lift these budget cuts without delay , so that people can get the help they need in the case of legal problems .
Last year , the state government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their clientele , and that the Palaszczuk government invests in this important work .

Podolski goes to Supercup with `` Gala ''
Hakan Sükesr is a football legend in Turkey .
In Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan SüKür .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
For the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is taking place in Turkey .
Before the duel of the arch-rival between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski 's Galatasaray Istanbul to the Supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : `` Business as usual '' is scheduled .
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the coup attempt in July , the government said that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be impaired .
But this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethald Gülen , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
This will not stop football .
An arrest warrant was issued by the Public Prosecutor 's Office against the former Starker Hakan Sükesr .
As a result , South Africa , now living in America , is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
It is intended to be a supporter of the preacher Fethald Gülen , who is responsible for the coup attempt by the President of the Republic , Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
It is true that the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days is valid until October , but in fact , it does not have any impact on the life of most Turks .
The night `` democracy guards '' in public places across the country has declared Erdogan to be closed on Wednesday .
Sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan .
Especially fans of the Besiktas Labor Club are traditionally not among the president 's friends .
What unites the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military coups .
Even the fans agree , regardless of whether their heart beats Galatasaray or Besiktas .
In the event `` Gala '' it will be particularly important to arrive again at Lukas Podolski .
In the past season , the Kölner showed its sporting value : With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31-year-old ended his first season as the top scorer of his club .
In the final game against Fenerbahce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
The newspaper `` Fanatics '' cheered him : `` He was the best in the place . ''
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
Thanks to `` Poldi , '' the disappointing season for the record master found a conciliatory conclusion .
After the Vorrunden-K.o in the Champions League , the `` lions '' came out in the Europa League early .
In the south of Lig , it only reached rank six .
The season was not good .
The cup was the only way to win something .
`` We managed to do this , and this is the most important thing , '' said Podolski .
For Master Besiktas the game year ran better .
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez , who , with 26 seasons of the season , presented the basis for the 14th title .
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old .
In this case , the Gomez , under the contract of the AC Florence and the Besiktas , had only announced , after the coup attempt , that Gomez did not return because of the political situation in the country after his/her holidays .
`` If Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say , '' quoted the magazine `` Kicker '' Clubchef Fikret Orman .
To do so , however , the storm would have to be prepared to dispense with around one third of its $ 7.5 million year , said Orman : `` We can not pay his salary in Florence . ''

Donald Trump admits massive problems in the election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative states , to lose their majority .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah .
A rare moment in which the usually large and self-assured multimillionaire said something like concern , as correspondents reported .
After having thrown 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing .
`` We have huge problems in Utah , '' said Trump before evangelical Christians that he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
To blame are the false reports of his candidacy , he reinstated his well-known media .
Wackening Republican strongholds
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans .
According to a survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June , Trump and his rival , Hillary Clinton , were on the same footing .
Other institutions see Trump ahead , but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk .
In an interview with CNBC , Trump responded to the question of how to stop Clinton 's advance : `` just as I have done so far . ''
And whether it will be `` successful , '' or I 'll do a very nice , long holiday . ''
He does nothing else than to `` tell the truth . ''
If it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , Trump said .
Then I return to a very good way of life .
According to the press , the Trump party is supposed to have threatened to remove funds to support his campaign , if he does not be able to present better results .
Instead of doing so , the Republicans '' candidates for Congress have a greater role to play in Congress .

What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis .
In December 2014 , he first won gold at the World Championships in Doha and , at the same time , presented his first world record .
Now , the former DSV Athlet Markus Deibler , via Facebook , has been protesting against his ex-team colleagues who are in criticism .
`` In a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 €premium and a jungle king 150,000 €should not be surprised by a lack of medals , '' said the 26-year-old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page .
The support system for swimming sport is bad , but the control of doping is very good .
In this way , we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look at it in the same way as we do on the issue of doping .
`` I do not say that controls should be stopped here , '' he added .
If he wanted to start a comeback , Deibler would have to be notified nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany ( NADA ) .
This is how it should be maintained with countries .
`` He who can not be checked for a certain period of time before World Cup/OS by independent inspectors of WADA/FINA can not participate , '' says the Election Hamburg , who is now conducting an ice cream .

After the land , parcelling and closing issues were clarified and the applications were made to be measured , the sale of the land in the residential areas `` Straslweg '' and `` Schönau-West '' ( area Binderstraße 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .

As it was said , developers can report to the city hall as from now , and the municipal council is expected to discuss the award of the parcels at its September meeting .
In order to be able to respond to requests for the settlement of other businesses linked to the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to amend the land-use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub-areas .
In the area of Untertimlarn , the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two parcels in the direction of State Road 2112 .

Post rises to trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
The post plans to sell its electric vehicle streetscooter .
The company intends to start trading with the transporter in the near future .
The postal service wants to offer its electric transporters in the free car market from next year .
`` We want to get involved in the sale to third parties , '' said a post spokesman on Friday .
The company has been checking for months whether it is going to sell its own developed stream scooter , with which letters and packets are delivered to other companies .
Post-management Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were repeated inquiries , such as craftsmen .
According to the news magazine `` Der Spiegel , '' the Bonn Group intends to enter the mass production of the vehicles in the near future .

Steel - lighting for German steel industry
The crisis-battered and energy-intensive German steel industry will be spared additional costs in millions .
The financial burden that the industry has threatened to support from organic production is from the table .
As a result of the exemption from the renewable energy levy on the stock in the German steel industry , the Austrian Minister for Economic Affairs , Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the `` West German General Zeitung '' ( WAZ , Friday edition ) .
`` I am really happy that we have finally been able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . ''
The European Commission , therefore , had initially planned to pay for the steel producers who use the gases from the blast furnace for their own consumption .
According to the German industry , the steel industry has threatened additional costs of EUR 120 to 240 million per year .
Gabriel said the WAZ , there is now a policy agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants that a 20 per cent levy is applied .
But this is not the case in the steel industry .
The IG Metal welcomed Germany 's agreement with the European Commission on the production of oases .
As a result , the status quo will be largely enshrined in the current regime .
The success of Gabriel for the steel industry is particularly important .
'With regard to our 'steel campaign ' , the future is 'a first step ' .
`` More must follow . ''
`` We also need to weigh up climate and employment targets in the reform of emissions trading , '' said IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
Last year , the situation continued to aggravate when the world 's largest producer country , China , threw on the world market on a massive scale in the face of weak domestic demand .
European producers are proposing price dumping for Chinese steel companies .
In the course of this spring the situation has been somewhat relaxed .
On the one hand , import duties have been imposed on imports and , on the other hand , the economic outlook in China has surged .
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
The German industry prime minister of the industry remained cautious on Thursday .
Last but not least , prices would have been more stagnant .
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Last but not least , ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
In the German steel industry , around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
In July , German steel producers will remain wary , despite rising prices and increasing orders .
With 3.4 million tonnes , they produced well six per cent less raw steel than in the same month , as the steel industry announced on Friday .
After a short increase in May , the amount produced went back the second month .
Since the beginning of the year , production has fallen by two percent below the previous year .
In the coming months , the association expects an improved order position with an increase in output .

Frankie Dettori achieves its 3.000th profit in Newmarket on predilection
Dettori sprays Champagne after a double in Newmarket , bringing him 3 000 profits
On Friday , the Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3.000th British profit at Newmarket .
He sat on predilection , which was trained by John Gosden , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reached the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
The three winner , Dettori , who won against Ghayyar , said : `` It 's something special . ''
I am very emotional because my family is here too .
I am very happy that it has happened in Newmarket , because I arrived here 30 years ago .
It is not a big meeting , it is not Royal Ascot - it 's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am relieved and very modest .
Dettori starts the Jubel when he gets the victory on predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-year-old winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the ninth Derbywinner had 4,493 career countries ,
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which few have reached before him .
He has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intellect , which distinguishes him from the other in the weight control room .
He is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charisma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already gained 6,000 profits if he were not just a weekend and big tournament !
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB , which is great .
He has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but it is also an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flavor for two decades .
It was nervous .
A series of big tournaments , including his famous `` Glorious Sieben '' in Ascot in 1996 , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban .
Three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six-month block , but he showed an impressive strength to defy his doubts and return to his best form .
And he is not at the end of the day - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : `` To go where it weaves ''
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : The locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia can not choose the country day .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood .
In 2021 , the provincial elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwerin Parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
This is not the case : Summer holidays , heat and land tagging - it is a bite .
The locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
The vast majority of holidaymakers in the country , on Usedom , Rügen or Hiddensee , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country day .
In addition , there are practical problems : During the holidays , workers who hang posters , balloon air balloons , distribute flyers and count in the end of votes , are only laborious .
Until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , once again , must continue to campaign for a short while on the people .
The hot phase , if you can say this at all , has just begun .
And it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , head of a SPD/CDU coalition , must fear his office .
The SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys .
It is exciting to see how much Neuling AfD is cut off and what remains to be done in the end of the coalition .
Sellering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost inconspicuous campaign .
He travels through the country , distributes roses and chatts a little with the people , just as his legendary word-like predecessor Harald Ringstorff did .
Otherwise , soul will get cold feet and give Chancellor Merkel the blame for the bloom of the AfD .
Her refugee policy , her `` We are creating this '' has speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists , which will probably cost him a good job now .
The CDU with its top candidate , the Minister for the Interior , Lorenz Caffier , has already seen how it is to campaign in the right place at the wrong time .
She has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Germany . Merkel is in the northeast .
But the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine-Westphalia , Berliner and Sachsen da als Mecklenburger and Vorpommern .
`` Since was probably the majority of other federal states , '' said Vincent Kokert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , recently in NDR .
But it is also a shame for anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
Otherwise , the North-East CDU largely waives the usual campaign stands at marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with sunshades and balloons .
This means that coke is only a `` minor role . ''
The Union , too , has noted that it is breaking the ground on the ground that it has to make a great effort to find a way back to the people .
As the Left , the SPD , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , have hardly ever seen .
However , the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert is also self-evident : `` You must go to where it weaves , namely where the people are : Dorffeste , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . ''
Because much is at stake , Sellering has now called its SPD into a particularly dedicated campaign .
In surveys , the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and only just before the AfD ( 19 ) .
At the 2011 election , the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , a small party with seven per cent in the surveys , are expected to make the leap into the country .
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and , most of all , move their campaign to the Internet .
`` Online campaign , '' called the president of the country , Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green voters come to search for local voters among the holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , the top candidate , just curvates with a house boat through the mecklenburgish lakes and finds it beautiful .
Her impression : `` Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment . ''

Woman suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night .
The police call witnesses after a woman was overturned on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday in the case of a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud shortly after midnight .
A woman put on the street in the dark `` in an act of despair '' and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vaud .
It is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was overrun by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
She died on the ground .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , who are asking them , as well as any witnesses of the incident , to sign up .
An investigation procedure was opened , which is a `` logical '' step in such a situation , said Gilles Hofstetter to the Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
Was a collision preventable ?
This is something that the public prosecutor must decide , '' said Hofstetter .
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held responsible .
In each of the two cases , where one person was on the motorway in the dark , it was decided that the motorists did not have to expect a pedestrians to run on the motorway in the middle of the night , as was said in the newspaper .
Last year , a policeman of the negligent killing was released after she had passed and killed a man who was at the A1 near Payerne in August 2014 .
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , the court took away .
The court found that the policeman -- who responded to an emergency call -- was in a legitimate way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a `` completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation , '' the judge said .
Anyone who has further information on the event on Thursday , near Morges , should contact the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .

Donald Trump 's campaign for election campaign accused of using a gun .
New York : Donald Trump 's campaign has been charged for alleged inaction after it has been informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina , in February , has sent a gun to an employee while travelling in a jeep in February .
The event is described in an indictment which was filed on Wednesday in the District Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
Bordini admitted to have been waiting for months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that `` that would not happen . ''
The campaign leader , Earl Philip , `` pulled a gun , put his right finger on the withdrawal , and rammed the run in Vincents Kniekehle , '' Bordini gave in his charge .
After having complained to the local and regional campaign management , Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip , he admitted in the indictment .
`` Arms must not be fired on to cause damage , '' said Bordini .
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a revolt when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the `` Second Amendment People '' - firearms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should appoint .
Trump 's campaign made it clear that the media would have taken its words out of context , and that it would not incite violence .
Bordinis complaint calls for compensation from the campaign for the infringement of the duty of care and of Philip for the injury of the body and the persistence of mental damage .
Trump 's spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion .
Attempts to contact Philip also failed .
WCCB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign .
To call on his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , has not reacted .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign .
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc. , 16-CS-14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

French court rejects offer on the demolition of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to set down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , where thousands of refugees live .
During a trial this week , the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to establish 72 provisional shops in which people within the warehouse sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down , because they would constitute a parallel economy that would not pay taxes and which have a risk of fire and sanitation .
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , because the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
They also claimed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people carrying out the 72 provisional shops , but acknowledged that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were `` absolutely understandable . ''
The judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops , cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feed people who `` live in extremely precarious conditions . ''
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids ' Café of the Camp , which is operated by the public , and offers 200 meals on the day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors in the camp .
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids ' Café .
In a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure `` would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the latest eight years old . ''
The two relief agencies Help refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a sharp rise in new arrivals during the summer .

Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US president has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by her from the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc .
In June , Gilead was exempted from a $ 200 million compensation payment for the breach of two patents of Merck , which were associated with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of misconduct by Mercks , including the freedom of expression and other unethical acts .
In the case of the action on Thursday , US President Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to adopt the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Merck tries to match with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs , which can cure more than 90 % of patients with liver disease .
The case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Merck accused each other of each other and the property on laboratory work that Sofosbuvir underlying the active ingredient in Gilead 's drugs .

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass exodus
`` He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan , is sitting on wrapped caffers , '' says the presidency of the Güen-nearby Foundation for dialogue and the world , Ercan Karakoyun .
In the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term , it could even become `` some hundred thousand , '' the President of the Association , Ali Toprak , believes .
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass exodus to Germany .
`` In the short term , I count with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand people from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , '' says Mr Ali Toprak of the `` World '' of Friday .
Because the government had already exaggerated Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions a few months ago , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were fleeing .
After the coup d'état , secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added .
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be repressed in Turkey .
`` It can not be that a state that itself absorbs refugees is producing refugees in its own country , '' said Toprak .
The head of the association deplored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in alevitian cities .
In this way , Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
`` They are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expelled over the past hundred years , '' said Toprak , who is also a CDU member .
The head of the association called for the German government to `` position itself as strongly as Austria against Erdogan and his followers . ''
There is also a `` witch hunt '' against Erdogan 's critics in Germany .
In recent months , I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany , particularly Kurds and opposition members .
The branding as a devotee destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence .
`` He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan , is sitting on wrapped caffaires , including the Kemalists and Seccularies , '' said Ercan Karakoyun , chairman of the Gülen Foundation for Dialogue and Education , the `` World . ''
As the newspaper reported on the basis of figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
As for the cut-off date of June 30 , this was 11.386 people and almost 29 per cent of all those who were eligible for asylum ( 39.625 ) .
This survey does not cover war , poverty or hopelessness .
The right to asylum under the basic law is exclusively political , that is , by the state , individually persecuted .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning
There will be no emotinaler gold than in those games , and that will mean what .
From the first rowing to the last , 220 hard Hieve , who enter the history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa .
There were three votes in the boat , even if it was only the Beides who sat at the ruder , and the trainer Robin Williams , who was present at the second Olympic old in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport , who set such a yardstick .
Their dominance was absolutely , after all , their 39.ter unlagged commitment , which is also unprecedented .
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not fully reflect the kind of triumphant .
Behind every gold in rowing , there is a battalion of willing helpers that contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no more assistant than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
As he said , he was risky .
I had bladder cancer , which is operational and that they did .
If you do not , it spreads everywhere .
It would have been a rather serious situation .
It changes a little of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice .
That is how it begins .
Rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one .
In the immediacy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a thrilling morning doing something more than otherwise , trying to process his own fears .
Stanning , who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan , said `` I was an emotional wreck this week , perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . ''
It 's only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin worked .
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thanks go to him ; he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have had a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost races over the past five years .
The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
Even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were very much at the moment .
Helen called `` remain in the process , remain in the process . ''
It is really important not to be sidelined .
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to do something .
We did not want fireworks today , we simply wanted to achieve a good result , go further and win the race , which we did .
The couple will take time out for a year before taking decisions about his future .
Glover must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall .
Now it simply wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that this was my last race .
That would have been too much pressure .
In London , it took around six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
It took about four minutes .
It feels so much better , '' she said .

Community , spirit , health : Sing seniors good
The Singen has already accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life : As a young girl she was in the school choir , in the school of teaching she was the subject of music , and today the 78-year-old is singing in a senior choir .
`` sing me - emotional and physical , '' she describes .
After a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and , in general , living , she says .
By the way , she does something good for her health and her spirit .
Because Singen is a great hobby for the elderly from several perspectives , says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League .
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music , describes Hackler .
Through regular interaction , senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts .
There are often social and family structures in old age , a chorus is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir : `` To speak out and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cohabitation . ''
Sing can be exhausting in the positive sense , says Hackler .
After all , seniors train a deep and controlled breathing .
Even in everyday life , those who regularly demand their lungs do not get so quickly out of the puste .
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , Singen is an optimal hobby .
For older people , Singen often has a very special effect , says Ursula Lenz of the German Association of Senior Citizens ' Organisations .
In the older generations , the common singing had a much higher role , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , it explains .
Lenz frequently observes that the singing or listening of songs to elderly people awakens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
By means of lyrics and in particular melodies , even dementia sufferers , people who suffer from a long period of time lag behind .
When singing is also demanding a special performance for the head , Lenz explains .
At the same time focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm , adapting themselves to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
Even older people living on their own practice not only to focus on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition given by the singing in the choir , says Hackler .
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
The feeling of self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
To show himself : If I long for something , I 'll be better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens .
There are good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough .
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , Lenz advises .
You do n't sing alone - with 50 singing people , who already hears when a sound goes next ?
In search of a suitable offer , seniors have various possibilities , says Hackler .
If someone is in a seniors chorus , you can easily join .
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area .
If you want to sing in a church choir , you can go directly to the town or the church .
Many elderly choirs can also be found via the internet .
If you do not have access to the Internet , you can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help in Internet search .
If you want to sing , you should definitely join a chorus , do Hackler .
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for any old age .

Destination plates : Who actually buys records ?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates .
Before you rush to the commentary part , in order to oversee him under the pseudonym non-AlleEinsamenmen 's middle age with rough insults , this statement is derived from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-discussed resurrection of records is not a boom in the Millennium , which wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects , but is due to midlife nostalgia .
Those who recently bought a record are , in all likelihood , between 45 and 54 years old .
In fact , the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely target group .
It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : Older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But will the results of YouGov vote ?
If this blog would be a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho , wearing a modest gray suit and wild , before I stop , my hands and say something like : `` So , let us take a closer look . ''
So let us look at it .
Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings that were once an independent seller - there is still a handful of fantastic record special deals .
I would probably ask the cameraman to eliminate the camera for the next part , in which I am close to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 to which I am of Sister Ray ( data count : Two young women , three men of middle age ) in Reckless Records ( data count : Eight men middle age , a woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
`` I appreciate , '' he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
These records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did n't follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
The reason he holds such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : He is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy and buy items that he sold when he was young and bankrupt .
`` Many things I buy are out of the late sixties , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 , things where I was probably too young to buy them , '' he says .
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and happy to spend time alone , and add : `` I do not smoke and I do n't drink a lot .
That is my disaster .
WEZ , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , also believes that many of the customers he meets on the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old plates .
From the conversations that I have had , people usually kidnapped their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
Customers who once sold their disks to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their disks again , '' he says .
This would explain the boom to supporters of the record revision of a certain age .
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people .
According to the WEZ , some of the older customers took the lead in the contactless payment system .
Some disk fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retire to the stability of trusted records .
`` I think sometimes it can be the filling of a emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation , '' says WEZ .
This is the case with me as a collector , and I think it is true for many people .
It is an easy way to deal with mentally .
`` We are like their social workers ! ''
A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
The survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have a record player .
I would probably be very concerned at this time of the news report while I smoked through a stack of Bossa Nova .
Jonny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data count : Three middle-aged men ) , has noticed a `` trophy aspect '' of the Revival .
`` someone came here very recently and said : `` I do n't have a record player , but I would like to buy a radiohead record , so that I can put it into the shelf , '' he says .
This is not a large percentage , but it is definitely going .
More productive , less musical .
We have people who say : `` I have no record player . ''
These are younger people , not older people who are only slowly coming out .
Fopp , which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has a blower audience than I meet .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle-aged women .
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts is the latest synthesizer and sex-packed Pop instead of experimental jazz , it is good to see such a diversity among the customers .
None of them looks particularly lonely , but mental trauma is hard to determine if you are standing for 30 seconds next to someone .
Elanora , 27 , has been running in the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of the plates on sale .
It is more likely to be a shop window than a big bucket .
It does not deserve much , therefore the collection of plates is not a real option , says it .
It costs a lot .
It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... '' it drives with a loving sigh .
I do not know how to explain it - it really is unique .
My last stop is a business that says that a new generation of record lovers will be inspired : Urban Outfitters .
While I appear to design the Jeans Hotpants , I watch a group of young teenage girls who are working for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player .
On the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : A mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are merely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them .
It is pure `` record art . ''
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more , there is nothing to complain .
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates .
Even if my enquiries revealed that the results of YouGov vote , they leave , at least in record shops in Soho , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
These people are likely to work hard at school or in offices .
They are certainly not going to spend their Thursday morning with the slums of the Berwick Street and the leaves of plates , while they avoid the inflexible gaze of an unsecret , 30-year-old false moderator , who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men .

The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany .
As CEO Josef Paul said on Thursday , `` It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in current or daily cash accounts . ''
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a sign that ordinary savers should `` not be afraid to pay for their savings . ''
Camps banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 % penalty rates .
As of September , Raiffeisenbank Gmund will require the Raiffeisenbank Gmund to withdraw from private and corporate clients for deposits of more than €100,000 on Giro- or daily cash accounts .
`` The first 100.000 euros are free . ''
`` The next 100,000 will cost €400 per year , '' Paul said .
He has been preventing 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not use .
`` They lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 % of costs , '' said the head of the bank .
`` I can not go for every million EUR 4000 . ''
The costs are now borne by the polluter pays principle .
Simply leaving the cash in the Raiffeisenbank 's coffers would be far too dangerous : `` I have already seen four attacks , I do n't want to be the fifth ! , '' said the bank .
Most customers would understand and changed to other types of investment .
Few migrated to other banks .
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria said : `` The ECB 's extreme monetary-policy stance causes significant costs for all banks . ''
To carry them on their own is `` not economically viable . ''
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or credit transfers .
The Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land , with its Skatbank Filiale in 2014 , made headlines with criminal interest rates for deposits from three million euros .
Michael Kemmer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association , said : `` We do not expect private customers to pay for deposits nationwide , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong . ''
A banker said that , on the Tegernsee , there was `` a clientele endowed with something more luxuriant . ''
`` That can become a problem for a small bank , '' if it is free of money .
The cooperative bank Gmund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rotarian Egern , crossth and Tegernsee .
Famous actors , sportsmen and entrepreneurs live in the region .
`` At the moment , no other banks are aware of the association federation of Bavaria , '' said spokesperson Ernst .
The president of the Federal Association of German People 's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken ( BVR ) , Uwe Fröhlich , stated at the end of June : `` The threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . ''
The competition was tough , and it drove off the emigration of investors to competition .
Customers in Germany will not be satisfied with this .

Scote Callum Skinner stormed home when Brite gold won gold for cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner last night in the men 's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for glory , when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had to embrace .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals .
They repeated the trick after they had only a modest sixth place in March at the World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff .
They did so in good time .
Hoy 's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man with whom they remained , when they saw potential in the Scots , which has unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny - who won Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualification rounds , but in the standard races the New Zealand won the first round .
And the British trio won the Duell with gold .
After his round , Hindes fell short , but Kenny brought the team to the front and skinner .
A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation , in which Hindes drove in a higher course in order to slow it down and to allow Kenny and , above all , Skinner , to keep pace .
Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner , Kenny and Hindes when they went to the podium .
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said : `` It 's a flattering comparison . ''
I am only here to do my best and make a name .
We have established an Olympic record in the final stage and defeating the world champions .
It was simply incredible .
There is no better way to win .
After the triumph in 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys side , Hindes admitted that , after a weak start , he was deliberately on the train .
He withdrew this statement later , and there was no opposition from England 's rivals .
This time , there was no such problem with such a surprising victory .
Hindes said : `` It feels with the whole GB flags in the gallery as London . ''
We have been working as a team over the past three months .
We did so badly for so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
This is an event , a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months that we expect successful five days in the Velodrom .
With the form Kennys , it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeats Hoy 's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
This would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , who was also born on 23 March ( an apparently holy date for British sport ; in the day Steve Redgrave , Mon Farah and Roger Bannister were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the same as Hoy .
Kenny is next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said : `` I enjoy this only for the moment . ''
The team event is always the best .
It can be won with his colleagues .
It feels rather lonely to win .
Hindes said : `` If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten . ''
It was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four four-kilometre races .
They arrived in 3 : 51,942 .
The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 51,659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) will take place today on the second day of the contest , where Wiggins will definitely focus .
Yesterday , he met with envoys prior to qualification , when officials called on him to measure his body size .
In the corresponding female competition that continues tomorrow and ends , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4 : 13 260 .
The GB team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to catch up with medals .
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were downgraded .
Dramas played in the background , such as the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April , in the midst of sexism and harassment charges , as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria pendleton .
However , if you look at the first night of competition in the Velodrom , it looks as if the legendary call GBs , which reached its climax at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .

Group on startup for live video game transfers
Watching other people playing video games is a giant - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit .
The technology group buys the Beam start-up , which specializes in this hobby .
As much money for the takeover , Microsoft did not share it on Thursday .
Beam 's offer only started in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
You can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
For example , they can give up missions and face enemies and provide equipment .
Activision Blizzard will launch a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport .
On the road to the global media event , Facebook is to help .
The advertising industry is already showing up .
The team of the start-ups , which is located in Seattle in the US state of Washington , has moved to the Microsoft Headquarters in California 's Redmond , as official co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi announced .
Therefore , the acquisition will not change anything for the customers .
Beam is integrated into the video game section around the Xbox console .
The market for live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly .
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming .
Twitch was bought by the online dealer Amazon in 2014 - almost $ 1 billion .
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google mother alphabet .

Escape : `` every woman who fled has experience of sexual violence ''
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who flee on their own .
When they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatized .
A house offers refuge .
Four women sit in a large kitchen .
Each has a baby that is not at most one year old .
One has put her little son in the arm .
He looks with great eyes curiously in the room .
His mother starred on the table .
Until she realizes that she is observed .
She smiling in short and kissing the little ones .
The scene is normal .
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr .
She is a business leader of Condrobs , a company for social assistance in Bavaria , and is concerned , among other things , with the issue of women on the flight .
The four women in the kitchen have fled .
They live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodation for women and their children in Bavaria .
In January , Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women 's Aid .
It was officially opened recently .
60 people live there - 40 women and 20 children .
Men do not exist - either as visitors .
The exception is a watchman in front of the door .
`` It is not an exaggeration to say : Every woman who arrives here has had experience of sexual violence on her flight , '' says Bahr .
`` Men are fleeing for wars because they are persecuted politically , because they are threatening torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope for Europe , '' she told .
For women , there are other reasons for escaping : `` many are secretly stealing from it , because they do not see any other way out . ''
In their homeland they have had experience of sexual violence , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
It continues .
It continues to flee .
`` It is not rarity , for example , for a bottle of water for a bottle of water , '' says Bahr .
And women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
Who believe that the end of the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , misses Bahr .
Here , too , single women in refugee accommodation would often be regarded as inferior and , at worst , abused .
This means that approximately 90 % of the women who live in the city of Munich are traumatised .
`` Some of the children are certainly not voluntary . ''
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
`` Or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . ''
Because they often do not want to help , it needs more accommodation only for them , demands Bahr .
In Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
Some say `` no '' to the question of whether they know about a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence .
In the Upper Palatinate and Oberfranken , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodation .
There are also women who are not kept separate , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , press spokesperson of the government .
In Oberbayern , Unter- und Mittelfranken , in some community accommodation there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
The exception is Niederbayern , where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately .
In a study published for the committee , it says : 'It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately ' .
`` There is a lack of privacy , or if men and women are housed together , there can be - perpetual - violence against women . ''
In particular , the washing areas should be separated and easily accessible for women , in the study .
How much the women feel this need for protection can be read in the rush to the house in Munich .
`` Since we have talked about that we have , we have a long queue , '' says Bahr .
You could easily set up a second house .

She wants Nacktkalendar for `` Women and for Men ''
The Treats magazine works together with the photographer David Bellemere to release a 70s Pirelli-inspired Calendar for 2017 .
But instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU muses Kalendar in 2017 .
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine is different from Oldschool-Playboys , as `` Playboy is for men . ''
I do that for women .
It seems to him that it does the Kalendar .
`` We must return to the depiction of timeless and classic nakness , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , '' Shaw said in a press release to publish the calendar .
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
Models can submit their pictures online or personally in the open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .

`` West Side Story '' with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the `` West Side Story '' with Tony and Maria as a tragic love affair , similar to Romeo and Juliet .
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
Salzburg : The `` West Side Story , '' Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece .
The artistic director , Cecilia Bartoli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and fulfilled the role of Maria a youth space .
In the orchestra dig the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel : `` This music is full of rhythm , '' he warms .
We always say that it is very Latin American .
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
It is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein 's music in our blood !
In this staging , Bartoli plays an older Maria .
She reminds her of her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
The role of Maria has always fascinated me .
First of all , because it is musically exceptional !
And then there would be Mary 's personality .
She says it in her song : `` I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and witty and bright . ''
It is therefore wise , of course naively , and very passionately .
`` It is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Römerin , '' laughed Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It is thus an honour for us to work with it .
It is an enormous human being .
And Bartoli returns the compliment : `` Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! ''
Diriging is a necessity for him .
You see it in each of his movements , in his gaze , it 's his life !
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
We have both a rather southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
For the American director Philip Wm , McKinley , the `` West Side Story '' is very topical : `` This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism . ''
Today we have the refugees , at that time the Puerto Ricans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want it .
These are the same issues , and they are just as powerful today as they did at the time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Queensferry Crossing : Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensland Crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife .
It is the first of four closures of the `` cover blowers , '' which are nearing completion to each of the three towers of the bridge .
The bridge of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 ropes .
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister for Economic Affairs , Keith Brown , visited the site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge .
He said : `` This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland Crossings .
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly great degree to this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used solely for this part of the bridge .
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the operation .
In total , almost 79 % of the total bridge cks in their place and the last part of the decks are now in Rosyth for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be placed on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : `` The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
In this fantastic project , the closure represents forward-looking high and low construction .
After installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the North Tower deck , we had to close the remaining gap on the north or south side .
This was achieved by dragging the northern feed bridge 700 millimetres south .
This was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate activity .
Because the viaduct is 222 meters long , about 6,000 tonnes and has had to be pulled up at an increase of about 3 % .
Delicate , because the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters .
Fortunately , everything went very well .

Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available
According to the head of the Bank , the RBS brand is expected to be reduced to a back-office service .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank 's global ambitions .
The Bank has since dissociated itself since it had almost collapsed and saved eight years ago .
At this time , brand strategists `` RBS '' used to protect other consumer finance brands .
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsoring , from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon , Andy Murray .
But now she has chosen to focus more national brands .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all RSB references , the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing are going to go to NatWest .
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other minor brands for retail , which will be more important - Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's Military Bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness shire .
He told the BBC Scotland : `` The RSB brand will become our investment brand and the brand that our staff will be working on , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . ''
When the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became a global brand .
I now say that we are not pursuing global objectives but local objectives .
Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
`` It is time for us to develop at the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? '' said the CEO .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that these brands would have been launched .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
We can launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come .

CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologies his statement that Chinese floats `` died as a pig ''
Byron Macdonald 's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m outdoor squadron squandered spectators of the CBC live transfer of the Olmypic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese float was `` like Mief , '' and during the race as `` a pig died . ''
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was switched off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free movement squadron .
Macdonald , who was brought to the commentary team of the CBS on board to give more `` color , '' could be heard : `` This small 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection , Baby . ''
Too excited , went as Mief , died like a pig .
Thank you for that .
The Chinese float in Ai Yanhan , 14 , swept the second stage of the swimming squadron 1 : 57.79 - 1.61 seconds more slowly than Canada 's Taylor Ruck , allowing the Canadians to fill the gap with China .
Viewers across Canada quickly reacted online after they were shocked by the tone and language of the language .
Emmett Macfarlane tweete , `` Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China `` like a pig died '' ? ? ?
The Idiot did not realize that they were still on show . ''
Ai Yanhan from China has been described as follows : `` This small 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection , baby . ''
Follow the criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter .
Twitter users did not go back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user , Sarah Paradis , wrote : `` WoW , # ByronMacDonald .
You represent CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists .
A short time later , Scott Russel , who moderated the CBC programme , apologized for MacDonald 's comment and said : `` We apologize that the comment on a swimming power was broadcast . ''
It was an unfortunate wording , and we are sorry that it has happened . ''
At the end of the year , CBC apologized to the people who responded to the information on Twitter
Scott Russel 's commentator has had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald .
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald 's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication .
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible for them to be broadcast .
Last night we apologized to our spectators on show and our folklore in the social media .
To make one clear , Byron 's comments related to the performance of swimmers and not to them as person .
However , they were inappropriate and an unfortunate wording , and Byron is very tired of what he said .
On Thursday afternoon , MacDonald apologized in the programme and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
`` I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment that I made after the feminine squadron at the CBC Olympic event , he said .
`` I have been referring to the performance of the swimmers and not to them as a person . ''
Of course no contempt was intended and I am very sorry . ''

Killed in the bombing : He was the hero of Aleppo .
He put his own life at the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
He was the hero of Aleppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
He risked everything to save others .
Now , the 30-year old has died even in the Assad regime 's bomb attack .
Omar was a member of the `` White Helmets , '' a civil protection group that , according to the Bild-Zeitung , saved nearly 60,000 people so far .
2900 volunteers are risking their own lives in order to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war area .
They are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : A video of the civil guard showing him an 11-hour bailout of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
It made the Syrians a shining symbolic figure in the horrors of the war .
As a hero , he never saw himself , said the picture : `` For me , that is the real Jihad . ''
`` If I die of saving life , I think God sees a martyr in me . ''
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
The Helikopters fired four bomb bombs over the Alzheimer 's district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
A woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
`` We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , '' the image quotes his last words before he died .
The Assad regime 's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists .

Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an electoral victory in Garland
Harry Reid , the leader of the Senate 's Democrats , is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate , Hillary Clinton , will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court .

The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia .
Reid said on Thursday during a phone conference that he expects Clinton to choose `` with a certain degree of certainty . ''
A Speaker of Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and speculate .
He praised Garland and said that Clinton 's team would not worry about a new candidate .
Garland is the supreme judge of the US Appeal Court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Republicans blocked the Garland nomination , be Lakaies , and supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .

Greenland : The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks come to the surface only in winter .
The Hai was able to return to the sea after a study on board the Sanna research vessel .
He was born in 1624 and swimmed with a 1 km/h of the North Atlantic - until today .
It is only 150 years later that Greenland sharks .
As a result of the North Atlantic , the Greenland shark continues along the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 metres wide .
Only when it arrives , the five metre long animal accelerates on satte 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this maximum speed .
But the lifestyle that is characterized by slowness seems to be a patent formula for a high age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the magazine `` Science '' in any case from a Greenland hai , which could be 392 years old .
`` madness , '' commented Alexander Schtaxation of the Max Planck Institute for Population Research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for vertebrates .
It is true that the evolutionary biologist has long believed that Greenland sharks .
Only failed the evidence .
Greenland sharks are hard to see , and they live in the Arctic Ocean in particular from the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually occur only in the winter on the surface .
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks .
They took their time at a time when they met six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen .
Today , this sharks still do : In the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swallowed the jaw of a young polar bear .
It may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling on the bottom of the ice sea and looking for carcasses from higher layers of water down .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as by-catches from the depth of the North Atlantic .
The smallest hai was just 81 centimetres long , while the largest 502 centimetre was measured .
In order to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the linens of sharks with the carbon 14-method .
This center of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks , the proteins that it contains are not renewed later .
The two smallest sharks had a remarkably high carbon 14 in the lens .
Their birth , therefore , should be after the early 1960 '' s , when nuclear weapons tests carried larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
By contrast , with 220 centimetres in length , the lineup contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from nuclear weapons attempts , so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in the course of its 2012 investigation .
All major Greenland sharks , on the other hand , had normal carbon 14 volumes in their lineup , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
Indeed , the carbon 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter of Greenland , while the record -Hai , with 502 centimetres , is expected to be 392 years old .
It was known that Greenland females will not be born only if they are longer than four metres .
Now the researchers of the length have been able to assign age .
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland sharks with the propagation appear to be at least one and a half centuries .
This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates .
It is no coincidence that such methusaleme is mainly living in icy waters .
Even the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland whale , in whose speck on the neck was a 120 year old Harpunenspitze , was caught in front of Alaska .
As a result of the low temperatures , the body of the animals living there often also runs on sparflammes .
So they later mature - and old more slowly .
In order to keep themselves warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly great .
Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal loses heat .
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant .
Another advantage : They have fewer enemies .
`` A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , '' explains the evolutionary biologist Schtaxation .
A very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : The first smartphone
Email and Internet in Zeitlupe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market .
Today , the successors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device wow almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
It was thicker and bigger , so it was not good .
On the contrary , it was quite eloquent .
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes , which would now suffice for approximately two selections with high resolution .
An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes .
The `` Nokia 9000 Communicator '' came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15th , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
For a few euros , lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they come from the time of the internet-age .
Twenty years ago , the Communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as a `` office in West Asia . ''
In fact , the new mobile phone could get a lot for then standards : SMS and e-mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communicator to reach .
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , although it was slow .
A pocket calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen .
Very proud was the price : 2700 D-Mark , that is about 1400 euros .
The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
No one could predict in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
Since then everything has changed .
The smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
The hands of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster , and was finally sold and executed to Microsoft .
Today , the market dominates providers , all of which came much later than Nokia .
Always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life .
In 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
It has sold about 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million pieces .
Global sales of equipment is around €400 billion .
This will lead to the well-running business of the countless App-providers and the telecommunications companies .
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
The major breakthrough in the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones on the Mac-World .
He promised three devices in one : A music player , a phone and an Internet communicator , all by touch screen .
The success of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , who dominated the market , had the night .
They disappeared finally , Blackberry has to fight .
The shots now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
On average , every German now has 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
`` We must all learn to throw away the smartphone , '' said Janina Kugel , responsible for staff in the Siemens Management Board .
Permanent accessibility now applies as a curse and blessing at the same time .

Clinton earns 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2 % federal taxes
On Friday , Hillary Clinton published her tax declaration for 2015 , which showed an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate and her husband , and an effective tax rate of 34.2 % .
In 2015 , the Clinton Foundation spent $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton earned almost USD 5.3 million in speech fees ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton 's candidate for the vice-presidency , Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia , publicly published his tax declarations over the past ten years , together with his wife , Anne Holton .
They paid an effective tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
`` Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , '' said Clinton 's campaign helper in Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion .
In a stark contrast , Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and returning to publish his tax returns on his promises to date .
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not required to do so by law .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for refusal .
`` They are on the train , '' wrote Clinton 's campaign helpers Ian Sams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of Democrats '' presidential candidacy .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump 's Special Adviser , told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax reviews are closed .
Trump 's critics , including the Republican presidential candidate for 2012 Mitt Romney , have already said that his refusal raises questions about wealth , his contributions to charitable organizations , his conduct , and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already touched on the issue and published a video on Friday in which senior Republican Trump would be calling for his tax declaration to be published .
On Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech on the Michigan economy .
`` He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns , '' she said .
Politico has reported that Trump has not paid for two years , or paid very little , during the 1990 '' s , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors who said that it could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett , who would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska , Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is located here , asked Trump to exchange his tax returns .
Buffett said that he had been subjected to a tax review of the IRS , and Trump had `` fear '' in front of the voters , not before the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax returns by 2007 .
The Clinton , now living in Chappaqua , New York , has on average paid an effective tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
The Clinton tax declaration of 2015 showed that they accounted for only $ 100 of their income as wages , unlike most of the Americans .
Its main investment was a low-cost index fund , from which the Clinton dividend and earnings of USD 109.000 were taxed .

Our hope lies on the night of Saturday .
The weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see many starches in the sky .
The startups are Perseiden , which , with 216000 kilometres per hour , are among the fastest startups .
They have their name , because they seem to come from the star image of Perseus , which goes to the northeast .

Russia 's Putin boosts Stodief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly sacked his chief chief Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov was part of Putin for many years .
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Envoy for Environment and Transportation .
In an opinion from the Kremlin , it is that Putin has `` ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . ''
Anton Vaino , who was Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
On the Kremlin 's website , it says ( in Russian ) that he was later the head of the head of the head of the government .
He said about his appointment to Putin : `` Thank you for your trust . ''
I think that it is the government 's most important task to support your work as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
Are the smiling faces convincing ?
This step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivanov was , for a long time , one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and worked as he did for the Soviet secret service , the KGB .
He was one of the most powerful men in the country .
In a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief chief resigned on his own wish .
But , despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
So , is this the result of a sort of power struggle ?
Nobody knows that at the moment .
But the official claim - that a man who was once prized as a potential president , would like to direct Russian environmental policy - was skeptical .
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin 's website , Ivanov said `` it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - for four years .
As it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov adopted the post in December 2011 .
Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service .
In the late 1990 '' s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , who replaced the KGB , Ivanov was appointed as his deputy .
When Putin came to power , he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most .
It was once assumed that , after Putin 's second term of office , Ivanov could become President of Russia , as a third term of office would have violated Putin 's constitution .
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .

Mother of a 6-year old with microcephalie : `` It will be better ''
Like most 6-year olds , Edmund Picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
But , like the least of his contemporaries , Edmund 's microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder , did not know his mother Elizabeth Picciuto during her pregnancy .
When he came home for the first time , my first thought was that I did n't do it .
I do not .
I did not agree with that .
What is wrong at all -- , of course , one has gone into it , '' she said .
Her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund would never be able to see her and that he might not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutionalize it .
`` My first answer was 'I did n't know that people still do , 'said Picciuto .
Edmund can walk with the help of a walk .
Edmund was unable to sit there until his third year of life and he was still unable to speak .
But it is progressing slowly .
It can run with support and cycling .
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund for `` Please sing me a bit before . ''
`` We bring to him sign language , '' said Picciuto CBS News .
But it is not a typical sign language -- it says , Edmund has invented some signs on its own .
Microcephaly has a variety of causes : Genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or Zikavirus during pregnancy .
The symptoms and predictions can vary greatly .
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of the Zikavirus infected .
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?

De Maizière said that , according to the acts of violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July , many people would be concerned about further attacks .
The state must respond calmly and resolutely to terrorist threats .
What is certain is that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
We will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
If criminals would have to leave the country more quickly , however , that would increase security and also give the people the support of the refugee policy .
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the federal elections in 2017 .
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces of the security forces , `` in the middle of a number of years . ''
There must be a return of sympathy for terrorism .
Video surveillance is to be improved , the right of arms to be amended to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet .
The last much-discussed confidentiality requirement for doctors is to be maintained in the words of Mrs Maizières .
However , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to find solutions to how to reduce the threat to the citizens , he said , with regard to mental disorders , for example .
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees , the Minister considers better social support .
Teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people .
In order to prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Darknet ) , de Maizière plans to use covert investigators .
SPD boss Gabriel said : `` The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further raising security . ''
It is important that the Minister for the Interior has clearly opposed activism .
`` That was a slap for the sharfmakers in the CDU/CSU , '' said Gabriel the newspaper of the Funke Media Group ( Friday ) .
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on Burma and the abolition of double nationality .
A general ban on full concealment is constitutionally problematic .
We can not ban everything that is opposed , and I reject the wearing of the burka .
We can talk about rules , for example , in the case of road transport or for witnesses in court .
Mr Simone Peter , head of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , said to the Minister that he wanted to simulate the power and ability to act with ever new anti-terrorism packages .
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said : `` Fleet and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring security to the people of this country . ''

Supercup : Barca with concerns about Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona is fighting for the first win in the new football season on Sunday .
The Catalans compete in the Duell for the Spanish Supercup against the FC Sevilla , the back game rises three days later at Camp Nou .
The Doublegewinner must give up in the balance of power with the subordinate Cupfinalists and the ruling Euro -- League-Champion among others in Neymar , who contest the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
In addition , Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing .
In the course of the training , the German suffered a change of body dust in the knee , thus , at least for the time being , the enquiry at Barca has been settled for the benefit of Claudio Bravo .
The Chilean International and Ter Stats have been competing for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
Coach Luis Enrique left to a clear decision in this respect so far and left Bravo in the league , but Ter Stats in most other competitions .
Before the first penny game of the new season , the Spanish champion doubts the fitness of the team that was humiliated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
Also at 3 : 2 in Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday , Lionel Messi and Co .
Seville , in turn , has to digest the 2 : 3 defeat after prolongation in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aspire to the second triumph of the `` Supercopa de Espana . ''
Barcelona is a record winner in this contest with eleven successes so far .

Relaxing night : Tips on sleep disturbances
The room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
That is anything but relaxing .
After all , we are in good society with such problems : According to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disturbances and more than ten per cent have seen their sleep often or permanently not recovered .
What are sleep problems or sleep disturbances ?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances , and there are many reasons behind it , emphasized Hans-Günter Weben , member of the board of the German Society for sleep research and sleep medicine .
However , what you can understand is the insomnie , that is , an entry and sleep disorder .
It is precisely that that many people find unsatisfactory or insufficient , says Jens Wagenknecht , member of the board of directors in the German Chamber of Medicine , in practice in Varel in Lower Saxony .
What is behind sleep disturbances ?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex .
Organic , mental or behavioral factors may be behind it , but also medicines .
Not seldom is the sleep disorder an expression of another disease .
`` very early awakening is often often , especially during a depression , '' said Wealth .
And it may be that different factors require each other .
For example , if you have a band failure , you can be bad , weight every two to three hours , and may start to greet about everyday problems and orgae , there is one example .
This leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
When should sleep disturbance to the doctor ?
If you do n't sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is impaired on the day , you should go to the doctor .
The impairment may be very different : One is insulated , tired , unspent , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irritable , has mood fluctuations or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches .
In order to alleviate sleep disturbances , it is important to find out its causes .
Treatment options include behavioral changes , cognitive behavior therapy , or even medications - classic sleep-tablets only in exceptional cases and not at most for two weeks .
In Germany there is hardly any person established in Germany , emphasizing Prof. Ingo Fietze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin .
For this reason , in the case of sleep problems , you should first contact the home doctor .
It is possible to investigate whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should enter the sleep laboratory and what happens ?
For example , to study in the sleep laboratory , physicians suggest , for example , in snoring with breathing irons , in the case of sickening day fatigue , sleep converters , or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fietze explains .
We really do not have to prepare for the study .
You should spend the day normally .
`` Only please do not make a nap of lunch , '' says Fietze .
After the curing , you go to bed at your normal time .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nozzle , a chest strap and a finger at the finger .
In addition , a camera on the ceiling sets the sleeping end .
How can people get to grips with the problems ?
There are plenty of screws that can be used for better sleep .
The hotel is located in the centre of the city , only a few minutes away from the city centre . The hotel is located in the centre of the city , just a short walk from the city centre .

Improved flow of traffic on the motorway
It is regularly on the bypass - here is a picture of November .
But this should change : The legal basis is to be extended .
This is good news for all car drivers who are on the road on the road every night in congestion when they drive through the motorway ( A 43 ) .
On Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16/17 August ) , the country 's road construction sector extends the area between the Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit at 700 meters .
Car drivers can then turn right directly from the Hammer Straße .
The big advantage : The traffic will be more early , thus improving the overall process on the much-frequented section of the Bundesstraße 51 .
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West .
The road narrowing down to the supplier will leave the car drivers mainly between 17 and 19 : 00 .
On weekdays , the backlog reaches to the bridge over the Albersloher way and sometimes beyond .
Reason is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Weseler Straße .
From here , transport is guided only by the motorway bridge .
The second track had to be built more than three quarters of years ago .
The reason : Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absorb heavy goods traffic in particular .
As long as this bottleneck and the related workday congestion will continue , the competent state company can not say .
However , there are years to be expected : The bridge has an official retention period up to 2034 .
For the prolongation of the legal deduction , the country has deliberately chosen the weaker time in the school holidays , because it is expected to be disabled .
The traffic is closed on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the site .

The right-wing `` identitarian movement '' has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
According to several state offices , the constitutive guards in the covenant have also kept the group under observation .
`` We see the `` Identity Movement '' as evidence of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order , '' said constitutional protection chef Hans-Georg Maate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
Thus , immigrants in Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being defamed in an extremist way .
That is why we are now seeing the movement .
The `` identitarian movement '' is a group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
It is opposed to `` multiculti-Wahn , '' `` uncontrolled mass immigration , '' and the `` loss of their own identity . ''
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden-Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Sachsen and Thuringia - are already seeing the `` identity bears . ''
Maate said that his authority had been closely aligned with the local authorities in the decision .
`` Groups like the identitarian movement try to pick up their target group because it stands , '' said the chief of the constitution .
In general , extremists try to raise them with youthful language , often with poppic music .
Both Islamists and right-wing extremists would do .
This is not a concrete advertisement for your own cause .
Propaganda is intended to appeal to people .
Young people are particularly vulnerable .
That is dangerous .
Last year , there were reports from several federal states about contacts of the `` identitarian '' to AfD-politicians .
He said that he had no knowledge of this .
For constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a point of view .
It is a question of whether the respective parties - in this case the AfD - will change their direction by certain individuals who are extremist , and become so extremist .
It is therefore crucial that those people have a tax influence on the party .
This is not recognisable .
In view of the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , he said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism .
But we have seen over the past few years that there can be constitutional structures .
There was the Old School Society or the Freital Group .
It may well be that other legalistic groups or groups of microgroups are formed that are planning attacks on asylum seekers , on refugees or attacks from other far-right motives .
But no German or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is recognisable .
The existing groups have been created at the regional level or in social networks .
He was concerned about the fact that many attacks took place on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
That is the cause of concern .
Many of the suspects involved in attacks on asylum accommodation were not known previously as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene .
`` So many people have committed crimes which , in the past , had nothing to do with right-wing extremists , who were perhaps politically indifferent or elected for example , such as the CDU , the SPD or the Left , who were then radicalised by right-wing extremists . ''

Why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
That is what I see under the Women 's Olympics in the tower , and that for more than one reason .
First of all , I have been here since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant .
And secondly , this team has three turners , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren `` Laurie '' Hernandez , which inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
The structure of this team , the Aly Raisman , who is the Jüdin , and Madison Kocian , who is Catholicin , makes everyone proud .
This team finally reflects the US .
It has reinforced the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
In the last four years , the number one among female turners has been an African-American .
Last year , Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
This shows strength .
At the last Olympic Games , Gabby Douglas was hailed by a surprising Olympic winner and America .
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the three World Championships Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez , as they provided unexpected , yet mastery gymastics routines .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American , who won gold at an individual multi-contest event for women .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We see the top of this sport , but this is not the way to see tournament classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie suggested all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team .
They are the `` last five , '' because the next Olympic team will only have four turners in the team , and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer .
But the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport and turner in the first place in private tournaments that are maintained by parents who pay for the training , installation , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their turner and families ) .
The majority of these clubs are in affluent suburbs that can support business .
In these clubs the Turner will receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , trainer of Laurie Hernandez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the tower .
We need to provide the communities with countless , young girls inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie , to provide more efficient and accessible training .
I set up my 20 years of tournament foundation .
During my events , we offered free and affordable Turnen in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and Hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
In September , we will be expanding to Detroit ( my hometown ) in order to offer young people high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Turnen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the spirit .
This combination offers life-long benefits for health and for school and professional success .
It is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that is great .
It is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
This is such an exciting time .
Thanks to Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of `` Girl Power '' by the Holen of the Olympic team gold and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

Pokémon Go , a health and happiness hunt that pays
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
The fact that teenagers and children are no longer outside the game , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been lamented by many over the past decade .
Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active .
The time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer , of course , to the Pokémon Go-Wahn , an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990 '' s ( later created as a cartoon series , game cards , and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the United States , Australia and New Zealand began in early July , prior to the release of the game in the United States , Australia and New Zealand .
The market introduction in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers have congested .
Within days , Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , the players , with their smartphones , go out and search for Pokémons , which will be traced with a GPS and , once found , `` photographed '' ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or `` captured . ''
A generation that played the game when it was younger , followed the election and jumped for the search of the sofa .
In the US , the game led to a significant increase in the number of steps that the `` average '' person spends every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch , which follows 35,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the market launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 % to 53 per cent .
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only provides raw data for performance improvement .
Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to get `` 30 minutes of time , '' `` to come from the sofa , '' and `` to be active every day '' have fallen on deaf ears , because many public messages are dull for health and come from people who look elend .
However , the importance of sport can not be exaggerated .
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of being affected by cancer or depression .
Physical exercise helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that are too long to lead them .
But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun .
Thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people even catch new friendships on the hunt .
As always , there are also mürric gamepers , who always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could go against a door .
What should it be ?
There has been a breakthrough .
Even if smartphone apps such as Fitbit had already been able to track our activity earlier , they did not give us any reason to drive sport as it does .
The new will lose its appeal and the use will diminish over time .
However , there will be more games based on poker 's success that will unite Apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people in the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Volkswagen is still a glimpse .
Despite diesel scandals , the delivery figures are rising worldwide .
But it is not in all markets .
In the call-back action , there is a term .
Volkswagen starts its deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe 's largest car manufacturer , despite its many brands and some well-run markets , has continued to offer a plus in the past year .
In July , however , the Volkswagen brand , especially in Western Europe , weakened the overall sales , as announced in the Dax listed company .
With 449100 cars , the VW brand worldwide sold 1.8 per cent fewer vehicles in July than in the same month of the same month .
In Western Europe alone , after China the second largest market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
In the home market of Germany , deliveries fell by almost one sixth .
Brand sales leader Jürgen Stackmann brought the weaker figures back in July , especially at two sales days , less in Europe .
Moreover , in some core markets , a `` changed economic environment '' has given way to buying back .
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup d'état in Turkey , the British vote on leaving the EU was also burdened by a spokesperson .
In the United States , where the gas affair was first escalated , there is also a minus of beech .
Great support for VW is the Chinese market .
As a whole , the mainly affected domestic trade mark of the Lower Saxony is , in any case , further conspicuous by the diesel scandal : After the first seven months , only an extradition minus from 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be found .
Fred Kappler , CEO of the Group , continued to present a sales margin from January to July .
At this time , 1.3 per cent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen , 5,904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests .
In Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million cars for conversion into the repairers .
In the course of the conversion , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
After the conversion of the vehicles , there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
The vehicle will provide the customer with a `` guarantee '' certificate after the conversion , but does not speak of a `` guarantee , '' as was said on Friday in business circles .
The reason is legal subtlety .
The `` Focus '' had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models .
Last Monday , this would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
It was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that this meeting was held .
`` VW fully meets the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA . ''
`` Sections of this are not accepted , '' said Federal Minister for Transport , Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , according to the ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that , in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion , there will be no deterioration and all the type-approved vehicle values will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term `` guarantee '' as it was said in company circles .
With the broad term `` guarantee , '' Volkswagen provides the possibility for customers , for example , to come to a workshop half a year after the conversion , for example - and to return this to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
Also , in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal will lead to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations , as was said .
That is why VW does not use the term `` guarantee . ''

The US wins fourth match for women 's field hockey , a showdown with Britain
One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3-0 .
Five goals in two games should be a worthy achievement , but Bam ( 27 ) said that they could not remember that they had ever done .
`` I have no idea , '' she said .
I am not one of the people who remember their goals .
However , they know that the American women stand at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Britons in the first place , which , after their 2-0 victory against Japan , remain unsecured .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals , the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will each get the first and second place .
The first place will be a little longer for the strong Dutchmen who lead the other group .
Whatever the outcome of the game on Saturday , the American women have created a surprising confusion by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last 12 places .
BAM was part of this team .
She grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
They missed the Olympics in 2008 , because they could not qualify for the cadre .
Then came the year 2012 , where everything went wrong for her and her team .
In the following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better .
`` A cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , '' Bam said .
We did not have the work in London that we now have .
We have been able to get rid of the ruder .
On Thursday evening , Bam opened the doors in the first half of the game with a handshake from the local area .
India was in the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter , until Bam took the game into its hands .
She carried out a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved into the middle and left the ball in the gate to give the American women a 2-0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the USA , Jackie Briggs , who had previously had to make a goal in each of the previous games .
It has a course .
Just like Bam .
`` We are in a good position , '' said Parnham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday .

Once sold over the price of the market , Café is back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a damaged coffee shop in Williamsburg , in which one could only pay cash , which had no Wi-Fi , but for 15 years it served good coffee .
Of course , the prices from his Bedford Avenue crowd out of charge .
The Soap Cherie business , which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cupcakes .
Indigenous people have been the last loss in a city that is gentrified .
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , `` I know , New York is changing , but I still can not believe that CBGB is dead , the Chelsea hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap business . ''
But if New York is changing , it is also reinventing .
A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere .
The coffee is still good .
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a longtime employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end .
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new outpost , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , maintained a great deal .
Verb used the same espresso machine model to use the same distributor for the Bagels .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment .
He introduced new ingredients .
On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnizations such as capers and soaked onions .
There are natural travel dishes .
The café no longer serves a beer , and there are fresh juices for this purpose .
After nine months , Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers .
`` many old customers have also been squeezed out by prices from Williamsburg , '' he said .
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
Even after she moved to Greenpoint , she would take the path .
After the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee box , she said .
`` It was clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture of the verb that struck me , '' she said .
Now she is drinking coffee again , even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on this day , instead of her usual Iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer .
He went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
`` I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter , '' he said .
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and incorporate new ingredients into the menu .
Today , Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he did not think that the soap shop took the old business room .
In fact , the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the coffee of the café as an ingredient .
`` I think we will go back to their offer , '' said Rodriguez .
And the traditional Polish inhabitants , Greenpoints , have also accepted the café .
A new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodriguez said that he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
The site also has other advantages .
A local juice shop wants to fill in and sell the hot coffee in the bottle .
There is an opportunity to expand the café to a nearby building .
For many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph Witt was a regular customer , saying that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
When the new café opened , Whitt said that the entry of the restaurant and the order felt a new coffee like a return .
`` I had to smell it , '' he said .

Heavy rains , flooding in Louisiana , Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday .
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall , reported the national weather service .
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that government officials are in permanent contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the municipalities concerned .
Mike Steele , a spokesperson for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Board of Governors , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags were raised .
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
A flood warning system is used throughout the south of Louisiana until Saturday .
The weather service announced that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
In the south of Alabama , a flood early warning system was used on Friday , while in the Mobile area it was still raining .
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs , both in Louisiana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
The Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge .
He also said that a downward flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger , as it will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas over the rivers that have occurred .
The River Tickfaw , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level at 09.00 on Friday , which has ever been recorded .
Rescue teams still plunged people from the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster .
Hansford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose sharply overnight .
He said that he would have warned him another stepson , who lives close .
`` We have woken up and flooded the water , '' said Hansford .
It reached my waist .
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hansford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and would be the only one who could swim .
Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster , where they were housed until Friday .
Krautmann said that the flooding had `` rapidly spread , '' since heavy rains continued and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions .
According to Krautmann , an observer reported close to Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches .
Krautmann said that the soil had been heavily insulated by the rainfall since Wednesday .
The authorities said that heavy rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failures in five school districts .
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa gave up 200 houses flooded .
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches that have now been flooded .
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets strained by flooding .
In the cities of Amite and Hammond , emergency accommodation has been set up to accommodate the evacuees .
`` As soon as the water starts going back , they will be able to return to their homes , '' he said .
In the town of Hammond the municipality of Tangipahoa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided to the residents for taking part , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops .
`` The last major flooding we had was in March , '' said Lacy Landrum from the City Council .
This seems to be a similar event .
In Mississipp , the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said that it was still raining on the Gulf Coast .
According to his data , a handful of houses have been reported to be flooded on Thursday , but none of this has been reported on Friday .
Keith Townson , Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
`` I saw water in places where I never saw it before , '' said Townson , `` and it still comes . ''

GfK 's leadership comes after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanged its head , Matthias Hartmann .
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprisingly .
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK showed that the chair of the Executive Board , Matthias Hartmann , becomes all the more uncertain the longer the success he has promised .
Turbulent at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK : Once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company 's management are the world 's number five in front of a personal new beginning .
GfK CEO will leave the company at the end of the year .
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board , Arno Mahert , is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
The management board of the Management Board will take over the previous member of the Board of Management , Gerhard Hausruckinger , as of 1 September , informed the company .
He should officially take over the function of a `` board speaker , '' until a successor for Hartmann was found .
As a reason for the resignations , the company called `` different views '' for long-term business orientation .
Details did not want to call a business spokesperson on Friday .
It is still unclear who will lead the market research company in the future .
In investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were most disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring undertaken years ago .
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK head since 2011 .
`` The fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , '' said it .
In view of the last bad GfK business figures , each shareholder will at some point be restless .
`` If this were the case at BMW , that would be the same thing as the quandts , '' he said .
After setbacks , the company had not been able to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 .
With 361.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year .
In the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 % with EUR 721.2 million .
The profit gained in the second quarter mainly affected the company 's reduced value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
The company 's value write-downs of 139 million euros , which were needed in the Consumer Experience Division , gave the group a loss of EUR 148.2 million .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million .

Simone Biles creates gold in the throne
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all of this .
Dynamic on the springboard .
Effortless on the bar .
Breathtaking on the ground .
At the same time it is very important .
And now , finally , the Olympic champion .
On Thursday , the 19-year-old American turlady erklom on Thursday for a multi-battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
Their total score of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and `` Final Five '' team of Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina .
The American women , Simone Biles , turnt on the wavelength during the single campaign of women in the art tournament at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American , who wins a multi-battle title and , as a whole , the fifth , while consolidating her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment .
This success brings them to the same league as a unique athlete such as Michael Phelps , who has brought her sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years , 15 World Championships - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion , Mary Lou rescuon , told her that she is `` the best turderman I 've ever seen . ''
They expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition that did not go so far between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations .
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be seen as disappointment .
The Americans , Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman , are outraged after they won gold and silver in the individual campaign of women in the art tournament at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Thursday .
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi in retirement .
Although Biles insisted , during their long journey to the top , never planned to have the future , that is not really true .
Part of its soil exercises - which contain its typical tumbling pass - is linked to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
It is no coincidence .
This girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child , and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman 's mother during a school flight in the gym in which Boorman trained , was put into effect .
Since the summer of 2013 , it has no longer lost a competition competition , a series of victories that will continue as long as it wishes .
Even if Mustafina easily led through two rotations , the image drove .
Schwebebalken and Bodenturnen - in which Biles holds the World Championship title - lauded .
She picked up again with 15.433 on the swear bar - and put one on the ground with a 15.933 on the ground .
Raisman embraced them gently when she expected her final result - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red , white and blue Eyeliners , as the vision that she once described in her collection book became reality .
Raisman 's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina .
This time , the 22 year old team capital called `` Oma '' by the Americans had a lead .
After her soil exercise , she overthrew the audience , overwhelmed by a comeback , which sometimes appeared doubtful .
As far as Biles is concerned , the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year olds , from the beginning of this week , has a very new meaning :

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main , therefore , in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London .
`` It is very likely that Frankfurt is most likely to benefit from the Brexit vote , '' says Michael Voigtland , Head of the financial markets and real estate markets of the IW .
After the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London out of financial transactions across the EU .
For the so-called EU passport , they have been authorised in Great Britain to date .
Large US banks are making use of this .
Several banks have already announced that jobs can be relocated .
The lobby association `` Frankfurt Main Finance '' expects 10000 new jobs to be created within five years .
For Frankfurt , such as the IW , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest eurozone banks , as well as other important authorities , such as the European insurance supervision , EIOPA and the ESRB risk management .
In Paris , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
`` The proximity of the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , '' says IW-Professor Voigtland .
It is true that Luxembourg is a large fund industry , but , as well as Dublin , it is worse off in terms of infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
In addition , the city with easily available commercial properties .
`` In Paris , it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , '' says Voigtland .
At the same time , they were 50 % higher for first-class commercial real estate than on the Main .
Moreover , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good health care and infrastructure and less crime .
In a ranking of the business consultancy Mercer , the city is in place seven , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 37th place .
Although quality of life is a question of preferences : `` With his already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , '' says the IW .
But , despite Brexit 's vote , London will remain the main financial centre in Europe , as economic researchers believe .
In London , according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba , in London , around 14,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015 , with 62,500 in Frankfurt .

Adblock Plus , Facebook in the `` cat and mouse game ''
For companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circumvent display blockage , a `` cat and mouse game '' are the same .
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display loops on its desktop , Adblock Plus published a blogpost that said that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding in terms of its advertisements , in order to make it more difficult to detect it , the detection of which part of the site is advertising .
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes .
In a blogpost , the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that `` this kind of Hin -- and-Her-struggle between the open-source community and the evasions has been underway since the invention of advertisers , '' and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's largest company for social media has entered the fight is a strong indicator of how worrying advertisers for the industry have become .
According to a study carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year , around 200 million people in the world use display lockers , almost four times more in 2013 .
With 1.03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 % of the advertising revenues .
The company has it on display blockers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad blockers have no effect on facebooks mobile app for the social network and instagram , a spokesperson informed .
Advertising on desktop PCs makes up a sufficient amount of revenue so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its `` scoreboard of preferences '' to give people more control over advertising targeted at them .
On Thursday , Facebook Facebook that Adblocks would give new filters cause for concern , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
`` This is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to raise the problem , '' said Facebook spokesperson in an email communication .
Ad blockers are a blunt means , which is why we have focused instead on developing tools such as Ad Preferences in order to put more control in the hands of people .

Northern oil workers meet again , strike strike
The wage war on pay for North Sea oil workers is being suspended , while all the parties to the dispute stand for a new round of talks , said negotiators .
Strikes against the oil field provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
`` Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute , '' says a joint statement .
We will hold some all-day meetings in the next few weeks , which will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems .
The unions said that their last strike , the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 % .
This year , Wood Group has reduced the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
The company 's group reduction follows a 10-percent decline for on-shore contractors in 2014 .
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the necessary space to cope with the market downturn .
Shell has laid off for its part thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , since it rationalises its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with the UK energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has been reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
The Scottish MEP , Dave Anderson , met with workers at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation .
The North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
`` In the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many , not just for a few , '' he said in a statement .
In 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion of spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $ 7 billion over the past five years .

Assistant doctors would like to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy 's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37.000 assistants who voted in an election rejected him .
In July , Hunt revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS would be in a `` no-land country '' and that any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients .
The first assistants are to receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend packages to improve care at a time of time .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the president of the BMA Committee for Assistants , announced last night in a communication : `` Assistants have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty , in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and do it to treat all doctors in a fair way . ''
For only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty , progress must be made and time is running out .
Efforts on the part of BMA to resolve the disputes by talking to the government for reluctance to participate and sometimes deafening silence .
This was the promise made by Jeremy Hunt only last month that his door would always be open .
`` Jeremy Hunt must act now , lift the effort and raise the concerns of the assistants . ''
If he fails to do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further industrial action .
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to physicians on the strike chain .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed Treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association .
BMA wants to have a better week-end pay for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , Director General of the NHS staff , asked the assistants to stop the strike .
Mortimer said : `` Measures of industrial action have nothing to do with little , but already burdensome teams and service providers and prepare patients , carers and their families only of concern , need and interruption . ''
Over the past two months , we have spoken to the Committee of Assists and have responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to the concerns about the guardians and the whistleblowings .
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from a career , training , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were concerned about compliance with BMA in November , February and May .

Salvation at Moelfre Bay : Three men have `` happiness to be alive ''
Three men have `` happiness to be alive '' after they were thrown off by their fishing boat before Anglesey .
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station beat on Friday at 13 : 20 BST alarm , after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay .
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
`` We saw the boat in its vicinity revolted and presented us the worst , '' said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones .
`` Unfortunately , the strong winds have already widened the boat beyond their reach until we left the water , '' he added .
Two of the men were rescued by a local fisherman , while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found on a Boje with no bailout .
They were all on board the coast rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said : `` The three men thrown into the water are lucky and still alive .
The boot engine had an emergency stop , but it caused the boot of the boat from the person who fired the boat .
Someone has woken up today about these men .

Russia and Turkey : An `` alliance of outsiders '' ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to declare an official end to the eight months of war of words and economic sanctions .
But , when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can not deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
There was a handshake , yes .
But Putin 's smile worked narrowly and he did not radiate heat , even for his restrained circumstances .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his `` dear friend '' Putin - five times , according to a report .
I could not count it any more .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had never happened .
My enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
But Putin 's sustainable mill showed that Russia 's head of state had not forgotten anything .
On the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : The shooting of a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was raging .
Putin shared out and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia .
The crime was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend .
Rebuilding the veto will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , state-controlled media unleashed a fierce , unlimited attack on Ankara .
At one time , it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything .
The most serious of these were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan 's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State .
He vehemently denied this .
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan .
Russia could win a kind of victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a cease-fire are clear .
Erdogan needs , first and foremost , all the friends he can get after he has almost stopped his post last month in a failed coup d'état .
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular , the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
The number has fallen by almost 90 % .
In Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed .
They count on a late Renaissance rush to the Mediterranean .
This week , the state television projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were re-allowed .
A report in Vedemosti put it as follows : `` tourists there long , tomatoes here . ''
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West , as it considers its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response .
To this end , the continuing resentment about the snail 's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey 's relationship with the West .
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara that he called for support for the elected authorities following the attempted coup d'état .
This is certainly a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change .
The summit in this glancing palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to portray an `` alliance of outsiders , '' as an analyst told me , : Two countries that are in breach of the West and feel badly treated .
Nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played its role as a peacemaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It could be significant that , after almost three hours of initial talks , both presidents stated at the press conference that they would not even have grasped the issue .
The President of Turkey deliberately failed to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize it .
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria .
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shoots the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are at least once again talking to each other .

Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Trampoline
Wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and striving .
It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning stair which is passed from the Armbrustprotect to the swimmer to the turner for the triathlete .
You can not turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour 's conversation in the coffeeshop , without listening to Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there is Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a female swarm with greetings , could well have been among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising , if he would be a swimmer , turner or even real .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is battling for gold in the Olympic trampolines .
The Olympic flame does not shed light on every event .
Further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports , which are not universally recognized : Air pistols , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
We will always have the breast swim and may be there for a long time .
But if I humbly make arguments for my particular darling , I would like to draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so sparingly perceived that many , I had asked , did not know that it is an Olympic sport in the first place .
This could also be regional ignorance .
Despite the fact that the US sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in trampoling , and had had an athlete by 2012 , who managed it to the end .
The Chinese and the Russians tend to get the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share in women .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline has a certain outsider charms , partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school that sounds for the Olympic Games .
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a geothermal enthusiast .
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous citation of his never-ending upshot - but also the grace of the tournament and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it .
The word `` trampoline '' comes from the Spanish El Trampoline , which means so much like `` springboard . ''
Rising winner jumps on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements ( turning , hues and balances ) before they end up on the feet .
According to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed on the basis of performance , level of difficulty and `` flight time . ''
Two thousand athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will face each other in Rio .
The most common Olympic vector is straight .
Medal hopes must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and above , sometimes to the target , sometimes to and back , upwards and downwards in the playground .
They are not only hunting the finishing line or the original wall , but also in television broadcasting another kind of polish objective : That of the world or of the Olympics .
The purposeful quest is noble , admirable , even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears .
But it is also what I feel rather tiring when watching these games .
The trampoline offers a breathing space .
The trampoline vector is above .
A forward movement is not the goal .
He or she turns off , apparently heavier than an astronaut , goes upwards , then downwards , then effortlessly again .
Here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no vaults in the distance , only the dreamful , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It can only be as much as competition in the Olympic Games .
The qualification and final stages of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC will broadcast the ends as part of a afternoon block from 14.00 .
In the midst of the Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult .
If awareness raising can only be achieved through the creation and objectification of male athletes - as the male US turner suggested a short time ago according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects the new fan community to follow his air .

Tourists to panic in Portugal after a military jet flying over
Sunbeters in Aveiro , Portugal , experienced the shock of their lives
A portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force Air Force set an incredible flash flight
The Air Force stated that it was on a training flight but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists started to panic after a tieffy jet crashed over a full beach .
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach of the sunbeds on the beach in Aveiro in the north of Portugal .
The holidaymakers jumped up when they were understandably beginning to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what the clouds had on them .
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media , said : `` It was really very bad twice , and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . ''
Nuno Arroja added : `` I was just on the surf and it felt as if the plane came down to me . ''
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and unexpectedly flew .
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to detect them .
The spokesman said that the jet was somewhat deeper than usual due to poor visibility , but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk .
This summer , land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , which also led to the death of four people on the island of Madeira .
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which was limited to his view
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .

More than just a Kardashian Reality-TV Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue .
Kendall Jenner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder , and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account .
`` In a space full of people I love , the sight of this cover for wines , '' wrote Kendall .
The revelation of the Covers was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians ? ) , scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family ( except for the problems of Rob and Caitlyn , and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) .
This is the stereotypical act of nearly every birthday of a child 's day ( Seacrest brought the sentence , `` You thought that we had forgotten you ? , '' with the sincerity of a cartoonist on a television at 8 a.m. ) , but Kris had to leave her other girls somehow in this publicity .
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue , a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun .
Kendalls 's big sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned ( she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue .
With a volume that looks more like a picture band than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( Laut Fashionista was from the 832 pages of the ramp 615 pages advertising ) .
The revelation of his co-star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were leaked before the official announcement .
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In recent years there were clearly more `` celebrities , the models '' as `` models that are celebrities '' on the cover .
Oscar-Prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer herself was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady Gaga had the honour .
But even with the little chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the `` breakage model '' of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good society .
These celebrities are not related to famous people or Reality Stars or young people of today , who know how to turn a good snapchat video ( even if all of these are applicable to Jenner ) .
They are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of lemonade .
Of course , Jenner 's success is not everyone 's success .
With her reality TV history , Jenner 's position in the world of fashion has always been somewhat tense .
In June , the former Victoria 's secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague , Gigi Hadid , criticised and called them `` the mistpieces of the moment . ''
These feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover .
But there seems to be a mistake on the point at the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue .
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word .
She runs for Marc Jacobs .
It makes advertising for your greeting of Estee Lauder .
They and all their sisters sell images of themselves on their respective pay apps .
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to the magazine LOVE .
And in her leisure time she is in Reality TV , probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children .

Justin Gatlin ( 100 , 200 , 4x100-m-Staffel/USA ) : The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics .
He was already locked up for two times because of doping ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .

Police : 3 victims in serial murderment when listening to music in the car
According to the police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series murder case of Phoenix , while they were in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis 's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June , while the car was parked in a trip , the authorities said .
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun gun , while he was on the front-passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , read in the report .
The police said that the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a robbery , because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims .
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt . Jonathan Howard said that the shooting team led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they are linked to four previous attacks .
In a total of four months , seven people were killed and two more injured in a total of four months in nine attacks .
`` It happens in a residential area in front of a house , '' said Howard of the KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , at the beginning of the month .
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown Nissan from the late 1990 '' s , a black BMW from the late 1990 '' s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site .
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pickup push half an hour before the triple murder , and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
Investigators found cartridges and secured a domicile and spherical fragments from the motor room .

The soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents : `` They must have the courage to talk about it . ''
`` medicine has made great progress , '' said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper `` Corriere della Sera . ''
When the disease was detected by her son , she believed she had to die .
However , the eight year old Tiago was well ahead and now learned privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
`` To give an example : If I ask him something about two years when I sang at the Milan Scala , he does n't remember anything , '' said Netrebko .
But he is the happiest person on earth .
Tiago comes from Netrebkos 's connection with the Bassbariton Erwin scrap .
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov .

Laws are constantly being screened in the name of the fight against terrorism .
Following the recent attacks , Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick safety package .
But what has a debt status to do with terror ?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation .
All his proposals are `` politically reasonable '' to the coalition partner , says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package .
They are not asking anyone .
Other , more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
As Minister for the Interior , however , he had achieved results and an `` achievable consensus '' within the coalition .
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach , de Maizière , a little time has passed before it presents its conclusions on security in the Republic .
However , these are all the more important .
Something is already known , announced , announced : That a new security authority to deal with encrypted communications is not new .
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU rules on passenger data and arms law .
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is not surprising .
In some cases , de Maizière launches a second attempt to make proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : He wants to criminalise the promotion of sympathy for terrorist groups and to turn the German passport into jihadists with double citizenship .
`` This will be difficult points for the SPD , '' says the CDU man .
It nevertheless seems to be reasonable , and it does not demand anything that does not exist in the case of the coalition partner in any case .
A few new ideas also presented de Maizière .
Some of them are in themselves : It plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people from deportation .
Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security review .
In the case of excesses for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse off than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw out their papers in order to mask their identity .
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive .
Some of them are still inextricable and leave questions open .
And , on a number of points - for example , in the case of unequal treatment - the question arises : What does this really have to do with security and terror ?
Yes , says de Maizière that it is important to distinguish between the issues of refugees and terror .
But it can not be denied that the perpetrators of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees .
Moreover , many people were concerned about security in the face of high numbers of refugees .
And things that people deeply employed could not be excluded even during the election campaign .
Internal security has become a major focus .
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
Uncertainty is great .
And yes , there are election campaigns .
The Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
Over the past few days , the two parties have had a great deal of attention .
First of all , there is a dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers , in which the portfolios of portfolios also call for a ban on burka and a departure from dual citizenship .
De Maizière is also concerned here with conciliatory sounds .
It does not seem to be moving away from a double pass .
We were happy with the discussion in Germany .
They do not make sense .
And with a ban on Burma , it has constitutional concerns .
Whether its own package is constitutional , and whether it is really `` reasonable '' for the coalition partner , has yet to show itself .
There are some things that could cause controversy .
But the SPD , too , is trying to benefit from the issue of internal security .
`` The SPD is prepared to talk about everything that contributes to further raising security . ''

Snapchat `` Anime '' Effects as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is inspired , but some observers say that it is insensitive to races .
With its filter tool , Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be out of a kind of Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are rugged , self-defeating tools that create more than 30 million improved selections per day .
All misdeeds go to the public .
Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past , in which they were accused of promoting the use of the Blackface or white skin as a beauty deal .
When , this week , some users proposed a filter that gave them slimming , wrong teeth , and evicted cheeks , some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - `` Gelbgesicht . ''
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a major problem that the company has with diversity .
The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Verge and Motherboard , one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature .
The company offered an apology : The filter was conceived as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians .
But outsiders who have seen racism reminded the filter of vulnerable stereotypes .
Others rejected the anime-comparison .
In an email , Grace Sparapani wrote , a Korean-American art student whose Tweet was widely disseminated over the photos , that the filter was `` vulnerable and , to say the least , inconvenient . ''
She added that `` it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not yellow , but that the yellow light has been dragged to the extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block .
American culture appears to be implicated in an endless diversity and integration campaign , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in their hands .
And Snapchats 's large audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counterparts - could be expected to expect sensitivity .
When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , `` it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than was previously the case , '' said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for the medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account , asking others to do the same .
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the large part of white , only male leadership , and ended her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
`` either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , '' said the Chinesich-American Zhu , `` or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what against . ''
Others share their opinion , a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered .
The company does not publish figures for the diversity of its staff and points out its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its staff , but , according to a spokesman , the company has recently recruited a staff responsible , focusing on under-represented groups and on internal integration efforts .
Zhu , for her part , said that she would leave her Snapchat account and added , `` I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K.. ''

Britain gets silver in 7 Rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-year Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis , when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji gave a master-class in handling , Side-Stepping , descendants , regular run and roher power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour .
The defeat was lost by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain 's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
The clear defeat of the Boks , 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the finals .
However , in this form , Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in its best form .
It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not happen - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal tomorrow at his neck : Fiji 's head trainer Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way to go .
Eight years ago , they lost under Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens .
Here they lost only one .
This cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji began miraculously and caused the attacks to take place out of fun .
At the end of the 20th century , Captain Tom Mitchell felt it would be a good idea for the captain , Tom Mitchell , to run on , as if you were going to run in a driving bus , the World Series winners went up 5-0 , when osea Kolinisau drove in the corner .
With four minutes of gameplay , Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted .
12-0 and GB has hardly heard the ball .
A hedging tack from Mitchell stopped the mount of Man Leone Nakarawa a third gate , but it stopped Fiji only .
In the seventh minute JASA Veremalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-launch and there were still over one minute of playing time ... in the first half .
Vbreatho Ravouvou drove through further weak Tacklings of the UK team and hit the line to make a goal .
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break .
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still going to be registered .
That is how it is .
GB carried out fundamental changes at half time and closed the fiji gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half of the day , until Josua Tuisova went through a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji .
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB , made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 , but the game has long gone for the south of the South of the South , whose fans sanged , scrambled and danced in the gallery .
It was not difficult to admire Fiji 's playful approach .
Mata Viliame put the i-bag with another attempt in the last few seconds .
The Pfiff , the Fijis embraced himself and GB kicked down in the lawn .
In the early days , Fiji Japan was defeated in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a narrow semi-finalmatch from the race - Britain 's transformation of difference .
Kyle Brown brought the Bok in the first half of the front , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a goal under the post in the second half .
A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team , secured the profit - and thus the silver medal .

Crazy for Kates Radler-doublier and other famous double workers in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have ended this week with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot , who has proven to be an impressive duke of the Herzogin of Cambridge .
But the 24 year old Olympionic is by far not the only one to fight gold , which has its own famous double worker - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media .
In honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces at the time on our screens , FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympionics that have more than a certain similarity with Hollywood famines .
The hunter and the wolf : Team member of the US team in Ararchery Brady Ellison , left , has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood .
Apart from Kates doubleroger on the bicycle track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archery of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be .
The team member of the US team in the archery of Brady Ellison caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star unsecretly resemble .
In fact , the archers got the madness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
`` I do n't see a great similarity , with the exception of facial hair , '' said Brady of the Huffington Post .
`` He is a good-looking guy , so I think it is a compliment . ''
One of the most popular comparisons since London in 2012 will undoubtedly focus more on this year : The onerous similarity between the British Weiltspringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
The Russian Turner Aliya Mustafina , with its large , expressive eyes , is to be able to go through as a double worker for the Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan .
And in the swimming pool , the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with Star Matthew Morrison for years .
One thing higher : This user believes that Nathan is the `` athletic version '' of the Inception actor .
Another persisting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett , who has similar eyebrows and lips .
The Russian silver medal swimming in Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-tanned skin and blonde hairs like the actress Annalynne McCord , while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to the same `` athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt . ''
Strong women : Football star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
Not the only thing : A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory in the room : According to this user , there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple .
A Twitter-Userin explained their satisfaction that `` the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical . ''
Indeed , the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Turnen Gabby Douglas , which has its own wonderful , broad smile , which is similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

The fee per cubic metre of wastewater is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the new village of Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of up to now 2.10 euros ; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros ( currently 2.26 euros ) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros ( up to 2.18 euros so far ) .
At the plant in Azendorf , the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed .
After an excessive calculation , the wastewater price in Azendorf will be 4.37 euros per cubic metre .
As Mayor Bernd Steinhaus ( CSU ) reported , in the approval of the budget by the Landrat Kulmbach , it was found that there were undercuts for these wastewater plants .
Due to legal bases , the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities on a cost basis .
As of 1 October 2016 , the citizens , as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the purse .
Charges are between 48 and 67 % .
As executive director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body , a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , it is also necessary to compensate for excess or undercover from the previous calendar period .
The serious charges raised by charges were justified by the fact that all three sewerage plants are relatively small , with a very low sewerage case , between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
For example , the small distribution base would have a serious impact on expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros .
Furthermore , the volume of wastewater in all three installations is slightly diminishing .
Furthermore , in the past calculation period , all three installations , not least because of their age of rehabilitation and repair , have been affected to a significant extent .
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Welzschenkahl , Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf wastewater plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged for damage .
At the Pumpwerk Welschenkahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor equipment had to be overtaken from the ground , and in the pond Lopp , after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage sludge had to be washed out , the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water requirements .
Schmidt : `` For these extraordinary expenses , the advanced care and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . ''
The same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below current levels in the previous calculation of 2011/2012 .
Stone houses made it clear that at the low level of wastewater in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are `` fully through . ''
The market community has been spared large entertainment costs for wastewater plants over the past 20 years .
The situation for these facilities will continue to remain precarious , in the view of stone houses , especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal basin is not possible to extend these facilities because they are deficient .

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : `` To go where it whaves ''
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : The locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia can not choose the country 's day .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , they understood .
2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwerin-duty parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
This is because , as so far , it is not up to us : Summer holidays , heat and day-to-day competitions - that is one thing .
The locals , who are to be persuaded by election fighters , are on holiday .
Most of the holidaymakers in the country are on the road to Usedom , Rügen or Hiddensee .
To this end , practical problems arise : In the holiday , aid workers , who hang up posters , blowing up air balloons , distribute flyers and , at the end of the day , not only sign up .
By September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day , Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to go back to the people .
The hot stage , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
And it 's also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his post .
The SPD , since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys .
To be exciting , how strongly newcomer AfD cuts and what remains in the end of coalitions .
Sellering , 66 years old , and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost unstoppable campaign , from his grandparents .
He travels through the country , distributes roses and pauses a little with the people , just as it did his legendary predecessor , Harald Ringstorff .
Otherwise , Seering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the fault of the AfD .
Their refugee policy , their `` We created that '' have speeded up the rise of rightwilists , which will probably cost him the fine office now .
The CDU with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier , has already seen how it is to campaign for the wrong time .
She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the United Kingdom .
But the target group did not agree , it was more North Rhine-Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburger and Vorpommern .
`` Since was probably the majority from other federal states , '' said Vincent Kokert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , recently in NDR .
But it is not a shame of anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
Otherwise , the Northeast CDU is largely abandoning the usual polling stations on marketplaces and before shopping malls with umbrellas and air ballots .
That , he says , is only a `` subordinate role . ''
The Union , too , has noticed that it is the source of the fact that it will have to make a great effort to restore a wire to the people .
It looks like the Left , the SPD , the Greens : Barely there in the world .
The Council of the CDU election fighter , however , coconut to his fellow parties , however , is also self-evident : `` You have to go where it does , namely where people are : Dorfeste , Golden Weddings , any birthday party must be used . ''
Because the stakes are high , Sellering has now called for a particularly dedicated campaign .
In surveys , the Social Democrats were last with 22 % behind partners , CDU ( 25 ) and only just before the AfD ( 19 ) .
At the 2011 election , the SPD had still clearly won by 35.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , small party with seven per cent in the polls , are expected to create the plunge in the land day .
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need , and largely relocate their campaign to the Internet .
`` Online campaign , '' it calls the councillor Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green election fighters are going to search for local voters among the holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , the world 's top candidate , is looking forward to welcoming you .
Her impression : `` Election leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty . ''

Donald Trump election campaign charges after staff allegedly drew gun
New York : Donald Trump 's campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after it was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February put a gunshot on a staff while driving in February in a jeep .
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday at Charlotte 's national court by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in that state .
Bordini admitted to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before reinventing that `` that would n't happen . ''
The campaign leader , Earl Philip , `` drew a pistol , put his right-hand finger on the withdrawal , and rammed the run in Vincents Knikehill , '' gave Bordini in his indictment .
Having complained to the local and regional campaign management , Bordini noted that at least four more people had already made the same experience with Phillip .
`` Weapons do n't have to be fired to cause damage , '' said Bordini .
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a stir when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the `` Second Amendment people '' - gungun owners and gun fans - should take measures if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and judges appointed .
Trump 's campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence .
Monday 's complaint claims damages caused by the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily harm and sustained psychological damage .
Trump 's press spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion .
Try to contact Philip as well .
WCCB , a local news outlet in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer staff of the campaign .
Calls to his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , did not respond .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign .
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc. , 16-CS-14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

Old buildings , a few lindenbakks , one of the rest of the cobblestones : The Riga Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not affect the first sight , but the police are one of the city 's `` dangerous places . ''
Walk from the east to the west , you will find playgrounds , a fresh nursery and a biolades .
The facade of a grey house has someone `` ugly ! '' Sprayed .
It is already under construction : A house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created by 2017 .
Articles about this `` trendy borough , '' as the real estate firm Friedrichshain calls , will be preferred in recent weeks with burning cars .
This is the home with the number 94 : Once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have leased , but on the ground floor there are still spaces and are used for events .
The Berlin Innenenator Henkel , in particular , had repeatedly argued for a crackdown on the project since the beginning of the year , calling for the `` no-go zone '' for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
After 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kadtersmiths , with 300 police officers were cleared , patrol the police for three weeks , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officers and three teams on the ground , closed parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
Meanwhile renovated construction workers commissioned the premises on behalf of unknown homeowners .
On July 13 , a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilee of sympathizers and residents .
On this summer afternoon , the street acts peacefully : Parents walk with children , people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun , others entertain Vorm Späti .
A primary school and kindergarten are nearby .
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many inhabitants : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in Kiev since 1999 , and Jana * , who is here with three children here , are mainly from the police presence .
With the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising rents and genetic testing .
It does n't sound like a jaw , which was a majority of police guard against vandaling Left .
The grass , which the Berliner Innensenator and police make up between the housekeepers and their neighbours , does not seem to exist .
In the East of Berlin , Friedrichshain was actually a traditional working district , which also has a low average income and high risk of poverty today compared to the rest of the city .
In 1990 , many of the houses in the former GDR were occupied , including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse near Riga .
While the Mainzer was cleared under great police conditions in a veritable street slump , many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still being inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
At the same time , in recent years , the borough has become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world : They now share their Kiev-era residents and former housekeepers .
This is also apparent in rents , which have risen by nearly 60 % since 2009 .
Many of the reconstructions in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : They can be recognized by the painted slices or freshly-pressed facades that have been thrown with color bags .
No other road has been mentioned this year , so often with the words of `` leftist violence . ''
One reason that not all neighbours consider this to be a problem could be that crime is not necessarily affected : Crimes like body injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against police .
Most of the offences are being made up of property , which tend to hit the newly constructed and newly renovated houses .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in a rental house next to the contested 94 in a rental house for 17 years , there can be no mention of uncertainty .
As far as violence is concerned , it is patently obvious : People in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been appointed .
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga .
For the studied Architektin , her street is not a forensic burning point , on the contrary : `` Here you can help each other , live along the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . ''
Neugebauer is deliberately drawn to the Riga street - and stayed .
For this reason , it was also so important that residents get their road back : From police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed sovereignty over the borough .
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer , the street continues to be removed : By careless new buildings in former building blocks that are pushing the old inhabitants .
`` These are , in fact , property housing , which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well-known , '' she says .
`` I totally disagree with '' violence and destruction. ``
But what to do if you never hear someone ?
There is frustration at all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
For the sake of getting rid of color bombs , Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding : The house projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw .
Those who draw up should be aware of this - just like someone who runs into a pub district , who can complain badly about noise there .
All persons presented with first-name names have asked not to be called with their right name

A controversial baseball star enters
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in best days from Base to Base .
After his emotional resignation announcement , the 41-year-old professional on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays will be wearing a last-minute tribute to his New York Yankees .
`` I love this game and this team . ''
`` I say 'Goodbye ' , '' explained Major League Baseball 's 14-and-one All-Star Game contestants .
Three times , Rodriguez was elected to the league 's most valuable player , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signature under a ten-year contract awarded him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
Until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as an advisor and youth coach - in full salary .
As players , Rodriguez paid back a long time with performance .
With 696 homerus , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( `` Runs '' ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees gave him some milestones .
With the Hall-of-Fame member Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two other baseball players in the main statistics show similar values .
However , the 41-year-old is not likely to be included in baseball 's fame .
Because so successfully Rodriguez - nicknamed `` A-Rod '' - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place .
Already in 2009 , the superstar was admitted to `` ESPN '' between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games due to a development in the so-called Biogenesis scandal .
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect to have received performance-enhancing funds for years over an anti-aging clinic in South Florida .
After a lawsuit , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
`` The league could even have done me a favor in 2014 , because I 've played through 20 years without a break , '' Rodriguez said at the time .
His absentee days did not go quiet too .
While many baseball legends were still getting the big stage in their final games , Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench .
`` My job does not include a goodbye tour . ''
`` My job involves trying to win every game , '' said Yankees coach Joe Girardi .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married to actress Cameron Diaz , and who will follow the relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox .
`` We want A-Rod , '' sang supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

Who builds Braunschweig 's cheap apartments ?
The SPD and the Greens mean that investors should be given a much stronger role in the future .
How to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years ?
The SPD proposes a `` approach to action '' at the next Council meeting .
But dispute is programmed .
The first concerns the question of who is to build the cheap apartments ?
A regulation has to date .
SPD we are agreed with the Greens : Who wants to build on urban land must in future designate 20 % of all apartments as social housing. ``
However , affordable apartments can also be built in stock .
However , the big dispute in the town hall is , however , Bratmann : `` How do you talk about investing in private land ? ''
`` We want investors to build on such land at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . ''
A new urban housing support programme , which will cost millions and will still be funded , will provide incentives .
The problem , Bratmann : `` There is still no agreement between the groups . ''
The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible .
The left wants to go even harder for investors .
Despite this , Bratmann said , the situation in the housing market is worsening .
If the concept of action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building management .
More staff are needed .
It is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
But the programme is not entirely : For the approximately 1260 new homes that should be built anyway .
But how does the loss of more than 1300 cheap apartments be phased out ?
It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
To prevent this , the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm should now be bought-up from the city .
In addition , consideration should be given to bringing homes back into price fixing .
This is possible in the western city .
The problem could be solved .
For in the West , the deadline is for the end of the year .
Around 1800 apartments could get back to price fixing for cheap apartments .
Only those who do not want housing companies .
The fact that the number of social housing in the West is dramatically increased again is the aim of the so-called mixture .
There should be no more of a concentration of social weakness in just a few neighbourhoods .
The Greens are counting on the fact that there will be some movement in the discussion .
Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke said : `` For a broad majority , the CDU must be in the boat . ''
This has concentrated on more places for single-family homes .
But what does not mean that we can not find a compromise .

Amid the rise of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympics .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable , a place of pride between competition and ambition .
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stab , which is used by the bracing protection to the turner to the triathlon .
You ca n't switch to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour 's conversation in the caffeshop , without listening to Simone Biles , Katie Leckenny or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there 's Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who , for the first time at the Olympics and a women 's black girl , would have been able to be among those well-known names sent to the Prime Time , built by sponsors and charity TV advertising if he would be a swimsuit , Turner or even fiery .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forrest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline .
The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event .
Further from the center , partly in the shadows are the sports that are not universally accepted : Air pist shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
We will always have the breast swimming and will continue to be there for a long time .
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular love , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it was his debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so embarrassed that many people , I asked , did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
That could also be regional ignorance .
Although the US sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in the trampoline game and have had an athlete until 2012 , who has won it to the final .
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians people to share for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline jump has a certain exterior charm , partly because it suits the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympics .
At this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a born enthusiast .
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonist of his never-ending stir - but also the grace of the tournament and diving , the two sports that are essentially united .
The word `` trampoin '' comes from the Spanish El Trampolin , which means so much like `` springboard . ''
Aspiring victors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost to 30 feet in the air and have to face a number of falling movements ( turning , hay and saltos ) before landing on the feet .
They are assessed according to the official Olympic programme of execution , level of difficulty and `` flight time . ''
Two-time athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
The most common Olympic vector is straight .
Medal hoping must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up to the top and down , sometimes to the goal , sometimes to and back , to the top and bottom of the playground .
They do n't just hunt down the finishing line or the starting point , but also in the television broadcast , another hitch goal : The world or the Olympics .
The purposeful pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator .
But it is also what I think of these games as something else .
The trampoline offers a breathing space .
The vector of the trampoline is above .
A forward movement is not the goal .
He or she prallt from , seemingly heavy as an astronaut , goes up , then downwards , then effortlessly again .
Here too , there is competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dreamy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It is like competition in the Olympics .
The women 's skills and endowments will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; those of men on Saturday , also around 13.00 .
NBC will broadcast the final hours as part of an afternoon block from 14.00 .
Amid the Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumbling .
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner loudly suggested to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan .

Riddles around fish landed in garden in Banff
A population of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff .
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be around Sandal , who were spilled by a fountain .
Mr Bain , who lives about 500 metres from the sea , posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .

Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V , Honda wants to pack everything : A little SUV , a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivan .
Sounds fairly overloaded , but the HR-V , constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , is actually proving to be very flexible in everyday life .
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in both the first row and the Fond .
The materials of the interior are well-processed and have a pleasant impact , only the cockpit top is falling .
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
It is not only available in 453 litres of high and 1026 litres on the left hand side , but there are the Magic Seats .
This is less magical than it sounds : The seats of the backbench can be flushed up like chin-chairs and thus provide vacuum space , which is high from the ground to the ceiling of 1.24 metres .
The boot is well-ventilated , but it is a bit higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
The tested 1.6-l-diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation loads very powerful .
But he is expected to make his work a bit more leaner .
It is pleasant to see the everyday consumption of 4.7 litres / 100 km .
There is another motorization : A 1.5-l-petrol with 96 kW / 130 horsepower .
An all-wheel drive is not offered .
Driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamism and comfort .
However , steering is probably something more direct .
The equipment can no longer be desired in the `` Executive '' category .
The security systems include the City emergency brake ( works by speed 32 ) , the collision alert system and the spacing wizard .
The collision warning is sometimes irritated by assessing many obstacles as `` approaching objects . ''
The distance assistant works very reliably .
And the smart Temporezer reacts to traffic character recognition and modifies the speed .
However , full connectivity is available only for top-up : 7-inch touchscreens , Navi , app integration and more .
Two USB and a HDMI book are under the armrest and are therefore easily accessible .
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order .
Those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol from 20000 Euro , the diesel from EUR 23000 .
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust gas standard .
With the HR-V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday-like car .

North Sea oil workers take on talks again , set strike
Labor battles over pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended , while all the armed forces are campaigning for a new round of talks , negotiators said .
Strikes against the oil field provider Wood Group have been conducted sporadically on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
`` Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , '' says a joint statement .
We will hold a few full-day sessions in the next few weeks , starting early next year to address the problems .
The unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group has cut the rates to its counter-operations in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure .
The company 's clearance rate follows a 10-result decrease for onshore contractors in 2014 .
The company said additional cuts will give the company the required space to get through the market downturn .
Shell has dismissed for its part of thousands of people and has announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with the UK energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with Labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea since a generation .
The North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
`` In the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , '' he said in a statement .
2016 will be less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of about $ 7 billion over the past five years .

Dead at bombs attack : He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk of helping others : Khaled Omar .
He was the hero of Aleppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
He risked everything to save others .
Now the 30-year-old has died in an Assad regime 's assaults attack .
Omar was a member of the White Helmets , a civil protection group which , according to the Bild newspaper so far , saved nearly 60,000 people .
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to attract people from broken houses and to provide first aid in the war area .
They are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the group 's face : A video of the civil protector that showed him at an 11-hour rescue of a baby out of the rubble of a house , walked around the world in 2014 .
It made the Syrians a shining symbol of the war .
As a hero , however , he has never seen himself , saying `` for me that 's the real jihad . ''
`` When I 'm dying to save life , I think God sees me a martyr . ''
Just before Omar himself fell victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing raids in Syria .
The helicopter rescued four assaults over the Altadia district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
A woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
`` We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb , so that they do not play children , '' the picture quoted his last words before he died .
The Assad regime 's deadly bomb had to hit terrorists .

U.S. backed troops say they have regained full control over Manbij from Islamic State
The US-backed troops have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border , after the last ISIS fighters in the city have left them , said a spokesman for the group on Friday .
The Democratic Forces Syria ( DKS ) rushed to the city after the outcry of the still remaining group of fighters buried within the city .
They have freed more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by fighters , shared by Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij military rat of Reuters , allied with the DKS .
`` The city is now under perfect control , but we are currently carrying out insurrection work , '' he told Reuters .

Destination plates : Who actually buys records ?
Lonely men of middle ages love plates .
Before you go to the commentaries , to overshadow him under the pseudonym of non-alleyone-sex marriage , this statement is derived from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-talked resurgence of soundboards is not on a boom in Reuters that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects , but because of midlife nostalgia .
Those who recently bought a plate are forward-looking after age between 45 and 54 .
In fact , the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group .
It is also not a horden by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : Older platters retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But are YouGov 's results ?
If this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while , in the midst of a busy street in Soho , I am running a modest grey suit and looking wild before I stand , my hands feel and something to say like : `` So , let us take a closer look at it . ''
So let us look at it .
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am in direct proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetable through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , to which I am from Sister Ray ( data number : Two young women , three men middle ages ) to Reckless Records ( data number : Eight men of middle age , a woman , presumably around the 20 ) is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
`` I guess already , '' he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
These sound boards , above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did n't go back home ) , dress up the walls of his caravan .
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : He is now in a position to buy plates that he could n't afford when she appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young .
`` Many things I buy are out of the late sixties , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . Things where I was probably something too young to buy it , '' he says .
He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone , adding : `` I do n't smoke and I do n't drink much .
That 's my lust .
WEZ , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers who meet him meet on the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pie , people who have heard about the comeback and who have been prompted to buy their old plates again .
From the conversations that I have conducted , people have usually escaped from their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
Customers who once sold their plates to buy themselves CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again , `` he says .
That would explain the boom to supporters of the record revision of a certain age .
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record shops offer a reassuring community of equestrian .
According to Weiz , some of the older customers took an impetus to the contactless payment system .
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar silhouettes , of objects that wake up happy youth .
`` I think sometimes it can be the filling of a liver or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , '' says Wez .
That 's when I am a collector , and I think it is so .
It is an easy way to employ mentally .
`` We are like their social workers ! '' We have a staff of a record pile .
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50 per cent of people bought a plate last month , they have n't heard yet .
The poll also found that 41 per cent have a record player they never use , while 7 per cent of those buying a plate do n't have a record player .
At this point in the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I am pillaging by a stack of Bossa Nova complains .
Jonny , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( data : Three men of middle ages ) , has noticed a `` trophy aspect '' of the Revvals .
`` Someone just came here recently and said : '' I do n't have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radiohead record plate so that I can put them in the shelf , `` he says .
This is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
More product load , less music load .
We have people saying : 'I do n't have a record player . '
These are younger people , not older people , who are only beginning to clean up .
Fopp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound boards , has a blower audience when I go down .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teens and middle ages .
Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts 's latest synonym and sexy-packed pop instead of experimental jazz rhymes out of the speakers - it 's good to see such diversity among customers .
None of them looks particularly lonely , but naughty mental trauma is difficult to determine if one is standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes in the business and looked at the varietal of the plates for sale .
It is more like a shopping cart than a wholesale purchase .
She does n't deserve much , therefore collecting plates no real option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It 's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... `` she drives up with a loved Sefzer .
I do n't know how to explain it - it 's really unique .
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : Urban outfitters .
While I would seem to muster the jeans hotties , I observe a group of young teenagers who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player .
To the left is a staircase house , a wall full of plates of Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : A mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to take them .
It 's pure `` record art . ''
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more , there 's nothing to complain about .
It 's no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates .
Even if my follow-up shows that the results of YouGov are voting , they , at least in record shops in Soho , leave out the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning with safety with the buck through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates , while they are miles to the startling look of an unsuspecting , thirty-year-old false presenter who has left unsuspecting men of middle ages .

The depressing food of the economic crisis in `` a plentiful meal ''
In March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
As a gourmets , President Roosevelt had a facile for refined delicatessen of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de fosie gras and Maryland Wassschlusdze .
His menu on that day was slightly more modest : Stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato peree and as dessert a plank pudding .
`` It was an act of culinary solidarity with leaning people , '' Jane Ziegelman said .
Her husband Andrew Cue added , `` It was also a message to Americans how they should eat . ''
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coes last book `` Tritate Suey '' was made by Chinese cuisine in the US , while Ziegelman was told in her book `` 97 Orchard '' about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
Her latest collaboration , `` A decent meal , '' which will appear in the Harper publisher on Tuesday , illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg 's Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , snowy-like snack at the Flatiron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive beans , while Coe , 57 , turtle with potato peel and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered Hackrates , this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
`` Rich food was very popular , '' said Ziegelman .
There was groundbread , liver cheese and bread .
They were made of a ingredient and something cheaper that stretched the ingredient .
Imagine so many of the things they eat as dinners .
Cue grinste .
`` It has to be in the stomach like lead , '' he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all-you-Can-eat buffet .
Teams of women cooks for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
The Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the first war .
`` It was a time when eating for Americans became a central , tense theme , '' said Cue , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
The new budget diet was just as tense : Mysterious foods such as bread and caskerolen were made to be used as a staple ingredient , the caskeroles as a `` wonderful way to recover , '' said Ziegelman , as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
Meat , which has been the focus of American cuisine for years , became a rare serving luxury .
Strange mixtures have been tried , as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over flavour or even healthy cuisine .
During her search for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a court dating from this era , baked onions with earthbuds .
`` It was n't a popular addition to lunch , '' says Coe .
Ziegelmann continues : `` It was surreal . ''
Earthbuds and baked onions do not fit each other .
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes .
As never before or since then , fiscal economists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - fueled the country 's eating habits .
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become `` budgetary politicians '' and to respond to the challenge of turning pampes like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
`` A Square Meal '' is a festival of historic Lectures .
In particular , the reports on the government 's response to starving citizens are tasty , as President Herbert Hoover 's laughter-eating attitude .
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse of his kitchen , he feeds like the millionaire man of the world to which he has become .
`` He mocks Continental cuisine like fish with cucumber , '' Coe said .
He sat in an almost bursting dining room and wore a smoking .
He was wonderfully alien .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to declare an expel .
As described in the book , the Antheus of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most expensive. ``
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , dealing with eating , was discarded once the country came back to the legs .
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegelman , as well as how science was applied to food .
The couple gave birth to the eating habits of Ziegelmans Sheriff 's mother , for example as she could n't throw away food .
`` She had a real fear of wasting food , '' Coe said .
Ziegelman recalled : `` You actually made people sick . ''
There was the windfall .
After the Teller was cleared at Eisenberg 's disposal , she and Coe found a dessert that they had prepared at home : The plumber , the President Roosevelt took to lunch .
`` It 's going to be called Prune Whip , '' said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to miss modest recipes .
There were no slaughtered cream , only plums , something flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Everyone exchanged something reluctantly a spoon in the tweeted , brown Glibber .
Amazingly , it did not taste bad .
Coe caught up three times a night .
As a Can-Do budget keeper said to his wife , `` A few hacked walnuts would help . ''

NASA climate model : Venus was once resident
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably resident .
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have raised once similar conditions with its hot , waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere .
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , erdged-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus .
The planet probably has more dry areas than de Earth , but had previously enough water and geographical variability to house life and protect against faster evaporation .
The early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter .
`` In the Giss model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus exits their daily side of the sun for nearly two months , '' said Gisas 's scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release .
This warmed the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which looks like a rainscreen to shield the surface from much of the sunrise .
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of Earth today .
The model brought up a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers .
Although she was probably resident , Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light .
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light .
As her Hydrogen entwarted , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model at the Geophysical Research Letters .

Donald Trump admits formidable problems `` in election campaign
The leadership of US Republicans is plagued by massive concerns , including in traditionally conservative states .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now left weaknesses of his election campaign in the past Republican stronghold Utah .
A rare moment in which the usually large-scale and self-assured multimillionaire expressed something like concerns , as correspondents reported .
After being thrown out of the race in his own Republican camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
`` We have huge problems in Utah , '' Trump said before evangelical Christians , who asked him about support in key states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
Guilty of false reports of his candidacy , he again took on his known media scarves .
Republican strongholds woke up
Utah is usually a secure bank for Republicans .
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June , Trump and his bankruptcies were on the same line by Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
Other institutions see Trump ahead , but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia .
In an interview by the Senate CNBC , Trump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton 's march again : `` Just as I have done so far . ''
And kiss afterwards : This will be `` either successful , or I 'll make a very nice , long holiday . ''
He does nothing other than `` tell the truth . ''
If it did not , in the end , for political correctness , he said , `` Trump continued .
Then I return to a very good way of life .
According to press reports , the party is alleged to have threatened Trump to drop funds to support his campaign , it should not be able to present better poll values .
Instead , the Republican Party 's candidates for Congress need to be more concerned .

The £2-per tag- drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart skin patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug after advised by authorities to administer this more people for a longer period .
Ticagrelor 's germination-inhibited drug reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
Regulator NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long take to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Regulator NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long take to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Some 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
Heart attacks and stroke cases are caused by collections of fat material in the arteries .
When the Belag breaks out , it can cause a blood from the water to the heart , causing a heart attack .
When the blood is dissolved , it can flow through the blood flow and reduce the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
Ticagrelor , manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and driven under the trademark Brilique , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood-bearing islands less likely .
NICE 's draft , which was published today , recommends a 12-month-long take-up of 90mg Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre , said : `` Despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke of stroke - often with dire consequences . ''
Fear of a renewed heart attack may have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
The experience shows that , in combination with aspirin , Ticagrelor is effectively reducing further heart attacks and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack .
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .

Adblock Plus , Facebook in the `` Katz-and Mehel '' about ad blocking
For companies that are making money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers tries to circumvent the ad blocking system , a `` cat and mouse game . ''
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display lockouts on its desktop side , released Adblock Plus posted a blogpost , noting that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network .
On Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop side would change coding as regards its advertising show , to make it more difficult to identify which part of the site is advertising .
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to circumvent the new codes .
In a blogpost , Adblock Ben Williams wrote that `` this kind of Hin-and-Her fight between the Anzealous Open Source community and the reunions has already been underway since the invention of display lookers , '' and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's biggest social media company has been in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying the industry has become .
Worldwide , according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe about 200 million people ad loosers ; almost four times so much in 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of advertising revenue .
The company has it on display blockages on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebooks mobile app for the social network and Instagram , shared a spokesman .
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large share of revenue , so Facebook makes the investment of such a step as rewarding .
On Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its `` display reference tool '' to have people more control over their targeted advertising .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
`` For users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , '' shared a spokesman for Facebook in an email message .
Ad blockers are a stunned tool , which is why we have focused instead on developing tools such as ad Preferences to put more control into people 's hands .

Berlin / Schwerin : Poll before countries elections : SPD and CDU lose
In the forthcoming elections in the Bundesländer Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses are recorded for the government parties SPD and CDU .
This gave representative surveys of opinion research institute INSA for the `` Bild '' Zeitung ( Friday ) .
While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the North , this is not possible in Berlin .
In both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and would thus have a good chance of continuing to hold the head of government .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , the SPD crashed from 35.6 percent over five years to 24 percent .
The party , according to the survey , would only be close to the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
The third place is controversial between the Left and the AfD .
The Left would be down 19 percent ( previously 18.4 percent ) , the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country 's day .
The Greens have been reluctant to return to the Schwerin farm day despite a slight loss of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) .
NPD and FDP would not be represented with 3 percent in the land day .
According to the Berlin Chamber of Labour , the survey showed that only 23 % ( election 2011 : 28.3 % ) would be the SPD of the poll .
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent .
They would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.6 % ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.7 percent ) .
The AfD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies .
By 5 percent , the FDP could hope for a return , but the Pirates would miss the move , unlike 2011 .

Here comes the Enforcing Trailer
Germany 's grass must be adjusted to the next generation of speed meters : In various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , which should be particularly effective over the ground .
For example , the futuristic actuation trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used in case of accident areas , where it would be too dangerous to use a mobile measurement by the police .
For example , at highway construction sites or connecting bridges with temporary timing , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed there .
However , a permanent mobile development can be too dangerous or complex .
The driver is self-sufficient : His battery holds five days on uninterrupted measurement operations , the case data being encrypted via a modem .
With laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously .
Variable speed limits , as well as traffic bans by time , track and vehicle class can also be monitored .
In the high-risk state , the trailer can be used by the manufacturer with a clutch .
In order not to simply clad it , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so the wheels are disappearing in the armored and also a smooth outer shell .
In addition , a built-in alarmist aims to protect the Blitzer against vandalism .
Since 2015 , the trailer has been tested and used in various federal states , according to Vitronic .
Foreign authorities also blasted with the new technique : France has recently changed 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .

French court rejects bid over demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , where thousands of refugees live in .
At a court hearing this week , authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to demolish 72 provisional transactions in which people inside the store sell goods , selling cigarettes to Energyrites , offer hairdressing , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or simple meals for a few euros in PISG restaurants .
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would be a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and that would have a fire and sanitation risk .
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-backed union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
They also said that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
A court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the deportation of people running the 72 provisional deals , but admitted that the concerns of Calais 's prefecture were `` absolutely understandable . ''
Judge Jean-François Molla said food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who `` live in extremely precarious conditions . ''
He said the areas offer quiet matches between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places under threat from the Netherlands was the Jungle Book Kids ' cafe of the camp , which is commonly operated and consists of 200 meals on the day , English and French classes , and advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors .
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids ' cafe .
In a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure would be `` for these children of a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . ''
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimate on Friday that the number of those living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a sharp rise in new arrivals over the summer .

Relaxing night : Tips against sleep disorders
The staff were very friendly and helpful .
That is all but relaxing .
After all , such problems are in good society : According to the Robert Koch Institute , for example , a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten per cent experience their sleep often or permanently .
How are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
There are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many reasons for which they can be used .
However , what you can see is the inomnie , that is , an intrusion disorder .
It is precisely the sleep that many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagenknecht , a board member at the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony .
What is behind sleep disorders ?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex .
This may include organic , mental or behavioural factors , but also drugs .
Not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of another disease .
`` Very early awakening is mostly in the case of a depression , '' Weeß says .
And it may be that different factors depend on each other .
For example , if you do not have a bandbreak case , you can go for two to three hours .
This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
When should there be sleep disorders ?
If you do n't sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week , you should go to the doctor .
The impact can be very different : It is sealed , tired , unabashed , has trouble with attention and concentration , is easily irritable , has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches .
To relieve sleep disorder , it is important to find out what causes .
The treatment options include behavioural changes , cognitive behavioral therapy , or drugs - classical mud tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Established sleep medics exist in Germany .
For this reason you should contact the doctor in case of sleep problems .
The problem is whether the problem is a physical cause .
Who should get into the mess and what happened ?
For example , in order to study in the sleeping laboratory , doctors , for example , are advised of breathing with the respiratory tract , in the case of disease of the daytime , in sleep converters or if you do not find the cause of confusion .
We need to prepare for the inquiry .
You should spend the day normal .
`` Please do n't make any lunch , '' says Fienets .
After the cabling you go to bed to the bed .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , a nasal glasses , a chest belt and a foils are pressed .
In addition , a camera on the ceiling captures the sleeping .
How can those affected the problem ?
There are quite a few points of order that can be used for better sleep .

Community centres show 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country 's most vulnerable countries are being dismissed from community centres each year , while the industry is considering the impact of further reductions on already overburdened transactions .
In Queensland , three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , refugees , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogations and similar - will be dismissed when they seek free legal advice and legal advice .
Legal services of the community , which have already been overworked , are ready for further cuts .
As of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
Queesland 's chief executive of Queesland James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Communities Centres found that thousands of people are already being dismissed every year .
Farrell said the situation would only be even worse without a repeal of the federal government decision .
`` Queensland 's community centres are chronically underfunded , meaning that thousands of people will be dismissed from key services you need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relations , people with inconspicuous and irrefutable debts , families who go through divisions , workers who were unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need .
The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help .
We are calling on the Attorney-General , Federal Justice and Defence Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these funds immediately , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
Last year , the state government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
It is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their customers , and to invest in this important work by the Palaszczuk government .

Assistant veterans want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt 's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in the election rejected him .
In July , Hunt unveiled plans to impose the contract forcibly , saying that the NHS would be in a `` no man 's land '' and would be damaging any further delay for staff and patients .
The first assistants are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care for uneasiness .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the chair of the BMA Kommitee for assistant doctors , shared last night in a communication with : `` Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and will treat all doctors fairly . ''
In just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty , progress must be made and time is running out .
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks have led to the government 's reluctance to participate and , at times , to silence .
That happened to the one that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open .
`` Jeremy Hunt needs to act now , lift the excitement and address the concerns of assistants . ''
Should he fail to do so , assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work .
The final strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to provide cover to doctors on the strike chain .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
The BMA wants a better weekly reward for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , director of the NHS staff , urged assistant doctors to end the strike .
Mortimer said : `` Work combat measures reach none of the little but are already burdened by overburdened teams and service providers and are causing concern , distress and interruption to patients , care workers and their families . ''
Over the last two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistants and have responded positively to the concerns about the status quo and whistleblowovers with the Ministry of Health and other ministries .
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from a vocational training course , training kits , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November , February and May .

How to protect Krav Maga from gun attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you .
We were talking to Ron Mizrachi , a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance .
Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video shows you how to turn around for your robber .
If you get closer to you , then you should first turn around , so you can see your attacker and `` get out of the rubble , '' says Mizrachi .
Then take the gun between your front and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow .
Then beat him to the Least and turn it into the Least , while the attacker stirs up against pain , throwing the weapon out of his hands .
At attackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gunpoint , take the gun and turn it , so the attacker ca n't shoot .
At the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest , then turn the gun out of his handle before moving backwards and targeting the weapon .
Sounds difficult ?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi imagines .
But remember that when you smoke , it 's safest to pass your money - unless you 're a Krav Maga Grand Master .

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass exodus
`` Those who do n't suit and dress Erdogan sits on packed coffers , '' says the chair of the Gülen-nearby foundation dialogue and world , Ercan Karakoyun .
The Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of vulnerable people fleeing from Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term , it might even be `` some hundreds of thousands , '' believing the association 's chairman Ali Toprak .
The Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany because of the crackdown of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
`` In the short term , I am counting on tens of thousands , in the medium term , with some hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , '' the Association 's Association President Ali Toprak says Friday .
Because the government had already overturned Kurdish strongholds with straps before months , 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing .
According to the doomed coup , secular and opposition ethnic Turks were added .
Many will want to start restarting in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey .
`` It ca n't be that a state that includes refugees is producing refugees in their own country , '' said Toprak .
The ban was the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Albanian cities .
This will help Erdogan to increase the exit of the Kurds .
`` They are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced in the last hundred years , '' said Toprak , who is also a CDU member .
The secession , the federal government , claimed that the federal government is `` as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters . ''
In Germany , too , a `` witch hunt '' is being held against Erdogan critics .
For the first time I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opponents .
The fire mapping as a Gülen supporter destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence .
`` Those who do not fit and lose Erdogan sits on packed coffers , incidentally the Kemalists and secularies , '' said Ercan Karakoyun , chairman of the Gülen-nearby Foundation dialogue and education , the `` world . ''
According to figures from the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs , as the newspaper reports , the Turks already represented the largest group of applicants recognised for political persecution in Germany .
On 30 June , this was 11.386 people and nearly 29 % of all identified as asylum seekers ( 39.625 ) .
This survey did not involve the fleeing war , poverty or lack of prospects .
Asylentifies according to the basic law are exclusively political , therefore from the state , individually persecuted .

Mata Viliame set the i-bag with another try in the final seconds .

Earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-final match from the race - Britain 's transformation of the difference .

60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
Men do n't exist - even not as visitors .
The exception is a watchdog in front of the door .
`` It 's not overly to say : Every woman who arrives here has made her escape experience with sexual violence , '' says Bahr .
`` Men are fleeing because of wars , because they are persecuted politically , because they are threatening torture or death or because their families send them to Europe , '' she tells .
Women overweigh other reasons for fleeing : `` Many steal it because they do n't see a different way out . ''
In their home , she has had experience of sexual violence , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
That is what drives them .
The flight goes on .
`` That Schleper , for example , for example for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rare thing , '' says Bahr .
And the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
Those who believe that as soon as they arrived in Germany are mistaken .
Here , too , single women in refugee shelter are often regarded as inferior and , at worst , abused .
That leads to some 90 per cent of the women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized .
`` Some of the children are certainly not voluntary . ''
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
`` Or they do n't dare to talk openly about the experience because the sham is too big . ''
As they often do n't get to help , they need more accommodation only for them , asks Bahr .
In Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
Asked whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility , some replies No .
For example , there is no such thing in the upper Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia .
Even in the case of pigs , only women who have fled are not separated , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , the government 's press spokesman .
In upper Bavaria , under- and middle-aged people , there are some community shelters or houses only for single women and their children .
The exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately .
In a study published for the committee , it said : `` It is very important that men and women are home separated . ''
`` Lack of privacy , or will accommodate men and women together , can lead to violence against women . ''
In particular , the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women .
As the women feel about this protection , you can read the rang that is available at the house in Munich .
`` Since we 've been talking about it , we have a long waiting list , '' Bahr says .
It could easily be a second home .

Salzburg 'West Side Story ' with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the `` West Side Story '' with Tony and Maria as a tragic love , similar to Romeo and Julia .
With a surprise Cecilia Bartoli .
A musical captures Salzburg : The West Side Story , Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece .
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth room .
In the orchestra , the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel : `` This music is full of rhythm , '' he warmed .
We always say that it is very Latin American .
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
It 's a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein 's music really in our blood !
In this staging , Bartoli plays an older Maria .
She remembers her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
The role of Maria has always fascinated me .
First of all because it is musically exceptional !
And then there would be Marias 's personality .
She says it in her song : `` I feel prethy , oh so prettty , I feel prethy and witty and bright . ''
So it is smart , of course naïve , and very passionate .
`` It resembles me very , my Italian character I have as a Roman , '' laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It 's so an honour for us to work with her .
It is an enormous generous person .
And Bartoli returns the compliments : `` Dudamel is such an extraordinary performer and very passionate ! ''
Digging is a necessity for him .
One sees it in each of his movements , in his blacks , it 's his life !
It 's so a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
We both have a more southern temperament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important !
For the American director Philip Wm . McKinley is the `` West Side Story '' highly topical : `` This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism . ''
Today we have the refugees , at the time , the Puerta del Sol went to New York and the New Yorkers did n't want them .
These are the same issues and they are just as relevant today .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Heavy rains , flooding gives rise to bailouts in Louisiana , Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday , and it is expected to have more rain on Saturday .
Numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains , reported the National Weather Service .
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards shared that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the communities affected .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the Governor 's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , said that requests for high-water vehicles , boats and sand sacks were multiple .
Steele said that alone the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested 10 thousand sand bags .
A flood alert system is used across vast parts in southern Louisiana until Saturday .
The weather service provided evidence that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
In the south of Alabama , a flight alert system was used on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile .
The River Comite near Baton Rouge and the River Amite near Denham Springs , both located in Louisiana , are likely to reach record lows after over the weekend .
The Metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could overshadow many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge .
He also said that a stream-driven flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger , as they will only slowly flow into the Lake Maurepas .
The River Tickshaw , south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level on Friday , which was ever recorded .
Rescue teams still pleaded to people from the floodwaters in the district of Amite and Wilkinson in the Southwest of Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and his stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday .
Hansford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet from his house , rose sharply overnight .
He said it would have warned him a further pen son who lives nearby .
`` We are guarded and the water flowed and moved in , '' Hansford said .
It reached my waist .
His wife , Hansford , said that in the 48 years they lived there would never have seen such high levels of the river .
Hansford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only person who can swim .
Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three in a major military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster , where they were housed until Friday .
Krautmann said the flood `` had spread quickly '' as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions .
According to Krautmann , an observer reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain .
Krautmann said the ground had been substantially depleted by the rains since Wednesday .
Authorities said heavy rains and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failures in five school districts .
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an ants in Tangipahoa had 200 flooded houses .
Residents were evacuated in two churches , which were now both flooded .
The forehead of the Municipality of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that had been washed out of flooding .
Emergency shelters were set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees .
`` Once the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , '' he said .
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa , almost two dusty roads were closed down because of flooding and sandsacks for residents to be included , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops .
`` The last major flooding we had was in March , '' said Lacy Landrum of the City Administration .
This seems to be a similar incident .
In Mississipp , the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
According to his claims , a handful of houses were to be reported as flooded on Thursday , but on Friday no one reported .
Keith Townson , manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
`` I 've seen water in places I 've never seen before , '' Townson said , `` and it 's still coming . ''

Better traffic flow on the motorway
It is regularly on the bypass .
But that is to change : The process of redress will be extended .
This is good news for all drivers who are on the road to the road on the road line every night when driving through the motorway ( A 43 ) .
In the area between the Hammer Straße and the departure Weseler Straße , the German road construction company extends the legal machine by 700 metres .
Motorists can enter directly from the Hammer Strasse to the right .
The big advantage : Traffic is becoming more early on , improving the overall process on the multi-way section of the Parkway 51 .
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West .
The train ride on the Zugern nerves the motorists especially between 17 and 19 .
From the beginning of the 19th century , the bridge over the Albersworth road and sometimes beyond .
The reason is the Nadelör on the B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler Straße .
From here , traffic is only diverted via the motorway bridge .
The second track had to be rebuilt well in three-quarters .
The reason : Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absorb heavy traffic in particular .
As long as this bottleneck and the related performance of this bottleneck will continue , the local authority can not say .
The bridge has an official rest until 2034 .
For the extension of the legal system , the local authorities have deliberately chosen the weaker than expected time in the school holidays because they are expected to be subject to a disability .
Traffic will be handed over to the building site on Tuesday and Wednesday .

Asocial family demolished before Deloging social apartment in Saltash , Cornwall
An asocial family left their social apartment after a delogising with a £50,000 damage because she had terrorised her neighbors .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash , Cornwall .
After being forcibly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing community found the property in an irreparable condition .
The walls were clashing holes , wooden dikes were blown up , rubbish was scattered on the floor scattered and graffiti was sacked to the walls .
The family were relocated and it is believed to now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy , who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing , said she feared the apartment could no longer be repaired .
She said : `` It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people do n't have to live in this way .
There are many things to take into account , as this property is likely to be seen as not so beautiful .
The family is notorious and their reputation is also .
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police said that the terror inflicted on the family , assaults with baseball sleepers , intimidation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive blows , strikes and floods .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the lease contract , received an ordinance for antisocial behaviour in June .
In some rooms of the house that will be torn down , old rubbish found
The property in which drugs traded in the past have been demolished
Neighbours said they had to fight them on the road and regularly called to call police
Cornwall Housing delved her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to draw up voluntarily .
The delogisation was cheated by facilitated neighbors , who said their lives were made to hell .
One said : `` They did n't hurt anyone . ''
We lived for 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
`` This morning we could n't sleep . ''
We stood up because it was so quiet - we are not accustomed to it !
Now that they are finally going away , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said that it would have been the family administered to cooperate with local authorities .
The family lived in the house to which police were called periodically , for 20 years
On the overblown side of the community deal , rubbish and old toys were scrapped
He added : `` It 's a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family , as a Deloging is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing .
This was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours had to be seen terribly .
I value all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Cornwall , as well as members of the congregation who have been brave to us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will donate to some neighbours and the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
A dirty mattress left back in one of the bedroom after Deloging on the ground
Housekeeping workers will now have to remove waste mountains that surround the house
In 2014 , police conducted a razor in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales , paraphernates and cash worth £1,700 .
Skeldon received a financial penalty after pleading guilty to the possession of a drug of class B in commercial abdication .
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
After they were without Oldach , Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
A lot of room walls were decorated with graffiti .
Police say they will delete tenants who do n't stick to the house order
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall shared that the Delogisation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house order .
`` This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusations as well as to those who were harmed by such behaviour , '' she said .
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Jewish director crushed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was after `` Arab '' call was removed - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media review after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre-election , as Arab guests had `` requested '' according to an employee. ``
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentary `` Shoah , '' gave his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ .
During his last stay , Lanzmann sought to find Israel on the hotel 's list of countries .
However , the country was not listed among the countries that could be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and destroyed ?
Lanzmann wrote .
Instead , the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own Call Center .
According to a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The answer he received there , `` shock him , '' as Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel worker said the measure was a `` deliberate decision to manage the Kempinski Hotel 's management . ''
The reason behind it was even more fury in the director .
`` The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted , '' said Lanzmann 's employee .
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hades-Handelsman called this a `` great shame , '' reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung .
We were horrified by this event and stunned .
That really is very shameful .
The fact that this has been borne in this hotel chain in Germany is even more disgraceful .
No explanation is needed .
We expect the hotel to `` draw the right conclusions , '' the officer said .
The incident sparked a pretty great response on the Internet , where people called a scandal .
Some of them listed the Kempinski Hotel that it would have been `` given '' to the alleged requests of Arab guests .
`` Ashamed you , '' it was said in another post that the hotel is located on the nobler Kurfürstendamm boulevard , near a synagogue .
The hotel quickly dismissed all the allegations of himself and called the incident a `` understanding '' and `` apologized '' to Lanzmann , reports The mirror .
`` There was never a direct statement '' to include Israel in the quick-selection list , `` the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel .
It adds that the country preference has now been added .

Steel - lighting for German steel industry
The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs in millions .
Financial burdens that the industry threatened to take from eco-flow support are from the table .
It remains in the case of the exemption from the Energi Terbarukan Saja Tidak Cukup energy conversion system for the production facilities of the German steel industry .
`` I am really happy that , after two years of negotiations , we have finally succeeded . ''
The European Commission has therefore initially planned to call on the steel manufacturers to use the gases from the furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
According to the German industry , the steel industry was threatened with an additional cost of EUR 120 to 240 million a year .
Gabriel said the WAZ will now provide a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Margrethe Vestager .
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants , all an EEG account for 20 percent .
But that too will not be made in the steel industry .
The IG metal welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU 's own electricity production commission .
This means that the status quo of the existing regime has been largely established .
The success of Gabriel for the steel industry is particularly important .
`` With regard to our 'steel ' , future is a first step . ''
`` More must follow . ''
`` Also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment objectives are to be weighed down , '' said IG Metall-Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe has suffered overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
Last year , the situation continued to rise as the world 's largest producer country raised the world market in the face of its weakening domestic demand .
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations of price dumping .
Over the course of this spring , the situation has eased slightly .
On the one hand , import duties on imports of imports have an effect , and on the other hand , the economic outlook in China has emerged .
It is unclear how sustainable prices are .
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp the University of Hungary remained cautious on Thursday .
Last but not least , prices would have stagnated .
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Most importantly , ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
In the German steel industry , some 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
In July , German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
They produced by 3.4 million tonnes of good six per cent less crude steel than in the previous month , as the Economic Association said on Friday .
After a brief increase in May , the produced crowd went back the second month .
Since the beginning of the year , production has been down by two per cent below the previous year .
In the coming months , the Association is expecting an improved order situation with an increased impact .

The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimming woman `` like Muef went off '' and during the race like `` a pig died . ''
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was switched off when he was to give his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-room floor .
Macdonald , who had been picked up to the CBS 's commentator team to give more `` color , '' could be heard saying : `` This little 14-year-old Chesin has lost the connection , baby . ''
To get up , walked out like Muef , died like a pig .
Thank you .
Chinese swimming in Ai Yanhan , 14 , swung the second stage of swimming-board 1 : 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck , which allowed Canadians to close the gap to China .
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shot by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted , `` Hat the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimming woman from China was '' like a pig `` ? ? ?
The Idiot did n't train that they were still on broadcast. ``
Ai Yanhan from China was described as `` this little 14-year-old Chesin has lost , baby . ''

`` I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment that I made after the women 's floppies in the CBC Olympics .

Buyers in Primark outraged over woman probing in the midst of business shamelessly underwear
Buyers did n't know where to see them when a woman pulled her clothes off in the middle of a Primark to try underpants .
To aggravate the situation , she said , as she told it , she pulled out and put her back to the shelf .
They continued and tried four pairs of underpants in a business in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone .
The Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where the woman tested the underpants before she put her back to the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , `` she stopped again and left the business without buying anything . ''
She said : `` People could n't believe what they saw . ''
In the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of underpants from the outlet , pulled her own stockings and pants and tried them .
`` She did n't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she was quite simply there , eat like Oskar . ''
`` Everyone kicked off when she pulled out the underpants that they apparently did n't like , as she put them back to the shelf . ''
She repeated the same with three other underpants before finally decided that her nothing liked , again and again .
`` She did n't seem to bother anyone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried . ''
Ms Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : 'How disgusted you would think that someone would take underpants with them who had a different person and who were not washed up . '
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added : `` As I have received , staff were trying to pull the garments out of sale after they went - which is just as good . ''
`` I would hate to go back home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had angling her and pulled her back and she was n't washed up . ''
A spokesman for Primark said : `` Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 in our branch in Folkstone . ''
All products in question were drawn from sale .

Russia and Turkey : An `` Alliance of outsiders '' ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and declare an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions .
But when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the murdering Hall of St. Petersburg 's Palace , I can not deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
There was the handshake , yes .
But Putin 's smile had a meltdown , and he barely radiated heat , even for his restrained relationships .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his `` dear friend '' Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could n't count it any more .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been as it would never have happened .
To me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
But a sustained and sustainable cold demonstrated by Putin that Russia 's leader had nothing to forget .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his words : The firing of a Russian fighter on the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction to the time was wuttering .
Putin shared out and accused Ankara of being back to Russia .
The offence was even bigger , as it was committed by a alleged friend .
Building the veto will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , state-controlled media conducted a fierce , full attack on Ankara .
Once it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
The most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan 's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State .
He disputed that .
But in St Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , this meeting was held only because Putin received the apologies of President Erdogan .
Russia had a kind of victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire are clear .
Erdogan first needs all the friends he can get after he was unravelled at a failed coup last month .
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there are economic motives too .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular , the ban on charter flights that typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
The number has dropped by nearly 90 % .
In Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed .
They count on a late-seasonal Anstorm to the Mediterranean .
This week , the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
A report in Vedemosti put it : `` Tourists there , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted takeover as a weak answer .
To this end , continued resentment of the EU 's accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey 's relationship with the West .
The Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus for calling for support for elected statehood following the attempted coup d'état .
For Moscow , this is a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
The summit in this Gaulal palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray a `` alliance of outsiders , '' as one analyst once described to me : Two countries that are in breach of the West and feel poorly treated and are now behind .
Yet , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently served as a peacemaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It might be significant that , after nearly three hours of initial talks , both presidents said at the press conference that they would not even have had the issue .
The President of Turkey deliberately had to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize it .
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria .
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shuts off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should , at least again , talk again .

More than just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the Vogue 's September edition
Kendall Jenner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted september edition of the U.S. Vogue .
Kendall , who is the trademark ambassador of Estee Lauder , and ran at Fashion Week in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday .
`` In a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this covers to the wine , '' Kendall wrote .
The cover of the Covers followed a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian a similar ? ) , scanned reality video that shows the whole Kardashian-Jenner family ( except for the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz onkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and ending it with a classic twist : They have all planned a surprise story .
This makes the bar-treated act almost every birthday episode of a children 's release ( Seacrest brought the sentence , `` Du damit that we would forget you ? '' With the honesty of a cartoon chanting on a broadcast at 8 a.m. in the morning ) , but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity .
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue , a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun .
Kendalls big sister Kim may have beaten her what the Vogue cover has been , ( she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year .
With a degree similar to a photo tape than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertisers ( Laut Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising ) .
The revelation of his co-star is eagerly awaited , that in the last two years , images of the journal are still under the official announcement .
Women already on the cover included Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
Over the past few years , clearly , more were `` celebrity queues , which mocks '' as `` Models that are celebrities '' on the cover .
Oscar prize winner and Dior trademark ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady Gaga had the honour .
But even at the low chance that Ms. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the `` muddle '' of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video ( even if everything is right ) .
They are really talented women who are pictured in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the last cover , had made the release of lemonade one of the most successful years of her career .
Of course , Jenner 's success does n't everyone .
With her reality TV story , Jenner 's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense .
In June , the one-time Victoria 's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised them and called them `` the lips of the moment . ''
Those feelings sounded again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue Cover .
But it seems to me that the point is to go on .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue .
She 's in the truest sense of the word a supermodel .
She runs for Marc Jacobs .
She makes advertising for your Grande Estee Lauder .
They and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps .
She sold by her made pictures of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to the journal LOVE .
And in her spare time she is in reality TV , presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children .

Patrick Roy joins the Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday , leading to too little co-determination in the team 's decision-making process .
Alternatively-President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will be looking for a new coach immediately .
`` Over the past three years , I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and honesty , '' the 50-year-old Roy said in an opinion .
Over the summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
To achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned to the organisation .
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that influence the team 's performance .
These conditions are not currently being met .
Sakic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked him for his contributions to the team .
`` Patrick has informed me today about this decision , '' Sakic said .
We value all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy became the winner of the League 's best coach during his debut season at the Avalanche in 2013-14 .
He led the club to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesota and missed out in each of the last two years the afterseason .
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points .
As Hall of Fame Torwart won Roy four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .

Construction ground in double pack
At the recent meeting , the Council focused on issues surrounding buildings .
With relief , the panel adopted the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that `` finally , the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . ''
After settling the plots of land , parenting and finishing points and the applications for surveying , the sale of the plots in the residential areas `` road path '' and `` Schönau-West '' ( Binderstraße - Section 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more .
The community centre is convinced that the bunches in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau are also addressing young families and senior citizens .
As it was said , builders can immediately report to the town hall , over the awarding of the plots , the common council is expected to discuss in its September meeting .
In order to be able to respond to requests for further business activity , linked to job creation , the Community Council decided to amend the set-aside plan only in the spring of this year .
For example , in the area of sub-timescales , the designated industrial area is expanded to include two parts of the road 2112 .

Why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
That is what I would like to present under the Women 's Olympian Mission in Turnen and that is more than a reason .
First of all , I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
And secondly : This team has three stars , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Laurie `` Laurie '' Hernandez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
The structure of this crew , the Aly Raisman , which is Jüdin and Madison Kocian , who is a Catholic , makes every proud .
This team finally reflects the US .
It has consolidated the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
In the last four years , the number one among female athletes was an Afro-American .
Last year , Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
That shows strength .
At the last Olympic Games , Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America .
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez , as they delivered unexpected , yet masterful gymastic routines .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American , who won for an individual multi-match event for women gold .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We are seeing the top of this sport , but so , in the rest of the country , tournament classes are not .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team .
They are the `` Last Five '' because the next Olympiad will have only four runners in the team , and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee .
But the reality is that Turnen is a more expensive sport and that Turner is primarily in private tournaments maintained by parents who will pay for the training , instruction , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their visitors and families ) .
The majority of these tournaments lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
In these clubs , the Turner receives their entire training and that is a costly and long-term commitment to the families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , trainer of Laurie Hernandez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the turf .
We need to allow the municipalities of Aug .
I set up my Turn Foundation of 20 years .
At my events , we have offered a free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters ( especially black and Hispanic ) and trained national and international .
In September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to provide the youth of high-quality turners who will earn the opportunity to learn and profit from this fantastic Olympic sport .
Turnen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and consistency for the mind .
This combination offers life-long benefits for health and for educational and professional success .
It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the Turnen and that is great .
It is so important to take part in sport , especially for girls .
This is so exciting .
Thanks to Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this genuine portrayal of `` Girl Power '' by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thanks to her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

Cats respond more sensitively than catcher on gunfire of juveniles
Biologists have studied in Hannover , which effect has caused cat babies on adult animals .
To her surprise , the mistress also did n't let the men go cold - but they always kept in touch with the females .
Female cats can recognize the erratic rate of cat babies on the small ones .
They respond to ten per cent faster on Lutte from kittens , who are in great distress , as scientists have found out of the Animal Veterinary School and Medical University Hannover ( MHH ) .
Catchers also respond to the rufe of kittens - but always equal .
`` Apparently , the acoustic differences between the mistress of less and sharply raised juveniles for the males are either not perceived or irrelevant , '' said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH .
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal `` BMC Evolutionary Biology . ''
In a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and tone of the kittens is different from the urgency of their aid needs .
A total of nine adult catchers and eight patients were observed from the MBH .
They were first played for a rufe of little ones , taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated by mother and brothers .
On the other hand , they were faced with gunshots of more highly inflated kittens , which were added in addition .
The researchers hold their results despite the low sample for meaningful .
`` All females , even those that had not yet had their own offspring , responded differently to the sheriff , '' said Konerding .
They turned faster to the speaker when this Rufe played off the very erased kittens .
This ability may be associated or develop with the gender maturity .
`` A surprise was that the males reacted at all , '' the biologist said .
In the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on baby noises in the past .
Also , some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants , whether they were mothers or not , reported biologist Marina Scheumann .

Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had established ISIS was `` sarcasm ''
Donald J. Trump sought to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by admitting that his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the `` founder '' of the Islamic State 's terrorist group would not be taken seriously .
This clarification raised new questions about the communications capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public .
It also brings together his fellow combatants , who are trying to protect him during an eventful period , in the peculiar position of declaring statements that he could not mean .
Having made the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night , Mr. Trump reversed in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS .
But in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic .
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day , at which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he thought the accusation was entirely serious .
When the conservative Radomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential nominee wanted nothing of it .
The last storm of criticism is based on Mr. Trump , while he tries to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling demand .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried again to return to this issue .
On Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has already raised Sarkasmus to his defense .
At the end of July , he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but he later declared `` Natürlich meant the sarcastic . ''
This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to change .
`` I think it 's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , '' said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates .
However , I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
Rather than defuse the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Trump has adopted an even more senior tone , as his poll values have continued to decline .
A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist , released Friday , showed a lead with great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida .
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements , he often accused his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstand his humour .
But while he is stepping up in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's henchmen have brought his loyal fellow protesters into the uncomfortable situation to face him , regardless of how provocative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , former mayor of New York and one of Trump 's most prominent principals , gave a great deal of trouble to the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday .
`` I believe in what he says legitimate , political comments '' said Mr. Giuliani was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump 's statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had set up the Islamic State .
In this sense , it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them backbenches , utterly wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State , allowed ISIS to spread out by making it more aggressive in the Middle East .
Ahead of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them up on each of his words and being biased against him .
He exited the `` poor , jemmerious '' television experts who try to understand him and said , `` You ca n't it ! ''
Some of the Democrats spotted Mr. Trump 's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency .

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The City of the Main , therefore , in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , has the best chance of attracting from London 's jobs and companies .
`` It is very likely that Frankfurt is most likely to benefit from the Brexit vote , '' says Michael Voigtländer , head of the sphere of the financial markets and real estate markets of the IW .
After the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether financial firms should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
For the so-called EU passport , they are now available in Britain .
These are just large US banks .
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs .
The `` Frankfurt Main Finance '' lobby covers the next five years with a total of 10000 new jobs .
For Frankfurt , the IW , it is the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the eurozone 's largest banks , as well as other important authorities such as the EIOPA and the ESRB .
In Paris , the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , although it has its headquarters , is less important for the financial industry than the ECB .
`` Proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate so directly with oversight , '' says IW professor Voigtländer .
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but as well as Dublin infrastructure .
Frankfurt is easily accessible thanks to the large airport .
In addition , the city with easily available commercial properties .
`` In Paris , it 's not so easy to find free high-quality offices , '' says Voigtlaender .
In addition , in the Seine , rents for first-class commercial goods are 50 % higher than on the Main .
Furthermore , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
In a ranking of the company 's consultancy Mercer , the city is ranked seven , Luxembourg on Square 19 , Dublin on Place 33 and Paris at 37 .
Although quality of life is a matter of preferences : `` With its already strong position as a financial base for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , '' says the IW .
But , despite Brexit 's vote , London will remain the main financial centre in Europe , my economic researchers .
According to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba , around 144,000 people in the banking sector worked in London in late 2015 .

Olympic 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Blurring : Due to a positive test of doping , Adrian Zielinski from Poland should not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases .
A learned athlete would have won almost a medal .
Before the seventh race day , the first official doping cases have become known to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
The Chinese swimming in Chen Xinyi , 3000-meter-impeachment helicopter Silvera Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish-born winner Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions came to light .
In Chen last Sunday , Diureticum Hydrochlorothiazid had already been proven to be used as a mascot for doping substances .
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon .
On Sunday , the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only 0.09 seconds missed by the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen would have to take part in the proceedings over 50 metres of freedom .
Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
The national association takes the matter `` very serious and demands of Chen full cooperation in investigations , '' Xinhua said from a notice : `` We will work with the International Sports Tribunal CAS and will accept the verdict . ''
For the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CAS for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases .
Also in the night of Rio , news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa , the 33-year-old went into the offensive .
`` I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , '' this was `` an incredible shock , '' she told the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT .
She was innocent , `` the only explanation could be food supplements , '' the athletic said .
According to the report , the banned substance is supposed to act as an EPO .
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended , according to BNT .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately spoke to the athlete with criticism .
`` I do n't understand why athletes do n't draw the right conclusions , '' he said : `` We Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been ruled out . ''
For example , all the figures from the chronic dysfunctional nation must not take part in Rio .
On Friday it was also known as the `` Adrian Zielinski , '' the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tomasz had been tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandroll three days earlier .
Both deny taking , but both must not start in class up to 94 kg .
Prior to the launch of athletics , the Danekowa case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
The International Federation of IAAF had banned the entire Russian team until an exception because of systematic doping , including the Läufernation Kenya in Rio many bad news .
In the swimming sport , in addition , the earlier offences in China also made a difference between athletes .
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
`` Sun Yang pinkelt purple . ''
`` If I see the podium above 200 m of freedom , I want to pass , '' Lourt said in the French radio .
Sun was also at the heart of a clash with Australia 's Mack Horton .
`` I do n't have time and no respect for doping fraudsters , '' he said .
Sun was positively tested in 2014 with the Chinese championships , but had to leave only a three-month lock .

Russia 's Putin fire chief executive Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief executive Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov was part of Putin 's closest trust circle for many years .
The 63-year-old was appointed as Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs .
In a Kremlin opinion , it is that Putin has ordered `` the dismissal of Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . ''
Anton Vaino , who was Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
Born in Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
On the Kremlin 's website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he was subsequently the chief executive of government staff .
On his appointment , he said to Putin : `` Thank you for your trust . ''
I think it is the government 's most important task to support your work as a Head of State with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
Convincing the smiling faces ?
This move has made Moscow mystery weeks .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin 's closest confidants , and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the KGB .
As a striker , he was one of the country 's most powerful men .
At a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men claimed the stabbing would resign on their own request .
But despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
Nobody currently knows .
But the official claim - that a man who was once prized as a potential president - would like to head to Russian environmental policy - came to great skepticism .
In his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Kremlin 's website , said Ivanov , `` it is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - complaining for four years .
As it turns out , I have been chairman of the presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov took the post in December 2011 .
Previously he was deputy prime minister and defense minister .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the KGB State Security Service .
In the late 1990 `` s , when Putin was Chairman of the BHS , which replaced KGB , Ivanov was appointed to his deputy .
When Putin came to power , he called Ivanov as one of five people he was most familiar with .
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin 's second term , as a third term Putin had breached the Constitution .
But that post was taken by Putin 's closest ally , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later .

Olympia : Three scams on doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya 's athletics threats threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympics .
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach to her home .
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
A Kenyan officials had told the former sprinter and today 's Coach , John Anzrah , in the Olympic village a Urgin sample under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Red .
This is what the Kenyan team has been reporting on .
The IAAF International Federation has asked the IOC of information about the case to impose its own investigations , and shared an IAAF spokesman .
`` Depending on the findings of the investigation and the following measures by the IOC , the IAAF will evaluate it , '' it said in an IAAF statement .
`` He ( Anzrah ) has gone to the doping control station and has spent as a Ferguson Red , the rehearsal and signed , '' said Kenya 's chief executive of Mission Stephan Arap Soi .
He was in possession of the athlete 's accreditation , who was on the list for training checks at the World Anti-Doping Agency .
Ferguson Red was in 2015 in Beijing World Championship over 800 metres .
Four days earlier , Kenyan athletics delegate chief Michael Roich had been deducted from the Rio Games .
He is expected to have informed of his country 's anti-doping tests .
According to media reports he is said to have been arrested at his return at Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special surveillance for some time now , following numerous doping offences .
The announcement by the IOC of more than 2000 doping targets prior to the Rio Games was unusual to suggest that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are being notified .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put much pressure on the African country before the summer play in Brazil , creating an anti-doping law and a functioning control system .
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
As a result , WADA Kenya took Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping regime is in conformity with WADA rules .
Kenya is seen as a big runners-nation .
The country 's athletics won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
In a series of television reports , the ARD has repeatedly complained that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Charlotte last called for a similar investigation into Kenya , as he employed in the Russian athletics .
It has been demonstrated that this type of sport has been completely and systematically dashed .
Russia 's athletics were subsequently ruled out of summer play .

England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring about renewal and prosperity in our local communities and in the whole of London .
For me , that represented the biggest attraction of Heathroads , just as in 2012 in London , when we operated a great deal to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End .
And that will happen again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow .
For our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the enlargement of Heathroads is too big .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage .
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcome , but Heathrow answers each asked question .
Like the Olympics , Heathrow is for many and not a infrastructure project .
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £211bn of good growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of GB .
We have a great team in Heathrow , which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in the time and budget , from the T5 - which was chosen as the world 's best airport terminal for five years - to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the world 's two most frequented career .
Now they are ready to deliver a third run , which is backed by £16 billion in private investment .
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow 's enlargement will also be one .
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , secure our future trade , and create a legacy of skills and employment to which England can be proud .
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury

Gfk leads after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is exchanging its chief executive Matthias Hartmann .
The returns came suddenly - but not quite surprisingly .
The difficult situation of the market research firm GfK gave the impression that the chair of frontbench Matthias Hartmann becomes even more uncertain the longer the successes he promised .
The global number five of the industry is facing a personal new start .
Gfk board chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board of Arno Mahlert already has effect on 12 September from the supervisory board .
The Management Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on September 1 .
He will officially assume the function of a `` predator '' until a successor to Hartmann was found .
As a reason for the recall , the company called `` different views '' on the long-term business orientation .
Details did n't want to call a corporate speaker on Friday .
It is still unclear to have the market research company in future .
In investor prices , it was said Friday that shareholders had been disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring launched years ago .
Mr Hartmann has been on the GfK tip since 2011 .
`` The fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , '' it said .
Given the last poor GfK business , each shareholder will eventually be unquiet .
`` If BMW would be the case , that would also make the quandts , '' it said .
The company had not been able to stop his loss-taking in the previous quarter , even in the second quarter of 2016 .
With €361.2 million , sales were up 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior year .
In the first half of the year , sales of €721.2 million fell by 3.4 % .
The profit in the second quarter has , above all , been charged with the company 's perceived value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
The corporate value depreciation of EUR 139 million , which was required in the Consumer Experience business area , was a loss of EUR 148.2 million .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GfK had a group profit of 19.7 million .

Mahaj Brown , 6 , `` wiped away from bullets , survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six-year-old child is shot .
The boys ' grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown .
The grandparents said Brown suffered multiple gunshots , including in the leaning , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital at his transport .
`` He went through a lot , his small body was extinguished by balls , '' shared his grandmother Delores Melendez to the station .
I simply can not believe it .
The boy 's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo multiple operations .
The boy 's family told the broadcaster he is expected to come back again .
He should have started the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown .
There were also three men : Two aged 29 and a 32-year-old .
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in the stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia .
The boy was spotted on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition , said the station .
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether they could be in one of the perpetrators ' injured men .
Investigators shared CBS Philadelphia that apparently there was a cruise between multiple shooters .
Patrones for storm guns , which have been traced back to various storm guns , have been paralysed .
It seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
On the road , on both sides of the secret , they were shakes .
So it seems that there have been several armed fighters who have been very actively involved , `` shared police surgeon Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia .
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
No arrests and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video .
On Tuesday , another 6-year-old girl was struck by a quake in the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect .

Snapchat `` Animal '' effect as Asian caricature criticised
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds .
With its filter tool , Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way that is isolated .
They can turn into an pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be made of a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are unfiltered , standalone tools that generate more than 30 million improved selections per day .
All wrongdoing comes to the public .
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past , in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface or propelled white skin as a beauty sideal .
When it was this week that some users suggested a filter , which gave rise to dark teeth , false teeth and dark cheeks , some critics called a racist caricature of Asians .
They wondered if these repeated controversies were pointing to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
The news and outrage were widely circulated Wednesday , with reports from The Verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat shared that it would have deactivated the feature .
The company offered an apology : The filter was thought to be a homage to animme characters and not as a caricature of Asians .
But outsiders who have experienced raciousness reminded the filter of vulnerable cliches .
Others rejected the anime comparison .
In an email wrote Grace Sparapani , a Korean-American art student whose tweet on the photos was widely shared , that the filter was `` vulnerable and to be found to be uncomfortable . ''
She added that `` it is difficult to argue with the counter-performance of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof , but that it has been pulled into the abyss .
Snapchat is not the only company to cross this cultural stumbling block .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
And Snapchat 's big audience of young people - who are different in terms of race than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
If one of Snapchat 's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , `` this is much more difficult for such things to stay unnoticed than was previously the case , '' the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account , asking others to do the same .
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she said that she believes that rabid-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the largely white , only male leader and ended their essay with a hashtag : # DeletSnapchat .
`` Either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , '' said the chinese-American Zhu , `` or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or well to say what . ''
Others share their opinion , a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered .
The company publishes no figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its staff , but , according to a spokesperson , the company recently hired staff responsible for focusing on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts .
Zhu said , for its part , that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added , `` I wonder if they need more users like us to say that is not O.K.. ''

Ma Long in a own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympian .
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and `` title defender '' Zhang Joke 4 : 0 ( 12,5,4.4 ) in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday .
For the first time , the World Cup first took the `` Golden Grand Slam '' with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Final Tournament and the Olympia Games .
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani .
The two Chinese , as expected , have been in the final game and have made the title .
It was clear that , for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the five rings .
Recent non-Chinese on top Olympic stairs was the former SVS-NÖ-legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea .
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone , between the sentences and at times-outs they had no coaches in themselves .
They withdrew to the gallery and left their knacks in fair competition alone .
`` I played for my country . ''
`` In the final game I play for myself , '' Zhang said .
After the partie posed gold and silver medal winners with the China flag .
The match itself was unexpectedly biased .
Ma had really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set .
After that , he made the pace at the plate and left Zhang as a whole .
By virtue of Ma 's superiority , it did not elaborate the expected match .
But nevertheless , there was enough to see breathtaking ballots .
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4 : 1 .
In his quarter-finals against Germany 's Europaiste Dimitrij Ovtcharov , the White Shrine had a ripenny injury , he was in medical treatment afterwards , had to `` end '' with Blech .
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jörgen Persson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similarly high table tennis Olympic .

Podolski attacks ' Gala 'after Supercup
Hakan sweetness is a football legend in Turkey .
An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the former football star Hakan Sükiss .
He is accused of being a terrorist group .
For the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game is taking place in Turkey .
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul to the Supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : `` Business as usual '' is said .
Even if the state of emergency was to be imposed after the crash in July , the government , which would not be affected by the everyday life of ordinary citizens .
However , this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to Fethullah Gülen , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
This is not the case before football .
Against former Starkiker Hakan Sükhr , prosecutors said a warrant was issued .
In the meantime , the South of America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sükär is to be a supporter of Predicer Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
It is true that the state of emergency of 90 days is still in place until October , but it does not have any effect on the life of most Turks .
The night-time `` democracy guards '' on public places across the country said Erdogan has been declared an end on Wednesday .
Sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan .
Especially fans of the Besiktas working club are traditionally not among the president 's friends .
But , given the dramatic history of history , the Turks are strongly opposed to military purses .
Even even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats Galatasaray or Fenerbahce .
At the `` Gala '' Cup , it will be particularly important to arrive at Lukas Podolski .
In the past season , the Cologne has proved its sporting value : With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31-year-old finished his first time as the top scorer of his association .
In the final game against Fenerbahce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
The newspaper `` Fanatics '' complained to him : `` He was the best on the pitch . ''
He finished the season superbly and secured the ball .
Thanks to `` Poldi , '' the disappointing season for the record master was a conciliatory conclusion .
After the pre-season k.o in the Champions League , the `` Löwen '' also shoots in the Europa League early .
In the South Lig , it was only to rank six .
The season was n't good .
The Postal was the only way to win something .
`` That 's what we 've got and that 's the most important thing , '' Podolski said .
For master Besiktas the match year went better .
Thanks in particular to Mario Gomez , who was the second title to the 14th title with 26 seasons as a South-Lig-Torprotective King .
That 's also the reason fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old .
In doing so , Gomez , who was under the agreement of the AC Florence , had only been informed of the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country .
`` If Mario wants to come to us , '' he must just say `` Kicker '' Kicker `` Kicker '' Club chef Fikret Orman .
However , to do so , the stuner would have to be prepared to dispense with approximately one-third of his year 's estimate of EUR 7.5 million , Orman said : `` We can not pay his salary at Florence . ''

`` A generation protest '' in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia were at odds with the government 's violent resistance .
Witnesses say tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police at gunpoint .
Is Ethiopia breaking together ?
Over the past decade , it has been one of Africa 's most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
But over the past few months , protests against the government rallied over the country and spread to more and more areas .
Last week thousands of people stormed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political change .
According to human rights organisations , the government 's response has been unmerciless .
Witnesses said police had shot and killed on tens of unarmed demonstrators .
The videos that are circulating about the protests , which are probably the last or earlier this year , show how security people beat young people while they were forced to take a stand against a wall .
The head of the UN Department for Human Rights now calls for an in-depth investigation .
`` It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , '' said Rashid Abdi , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region , particularly in Somalia , and only a few countries in Africa , if all , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia 's economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa .
The streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
While Ethiopia was far from being a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to press the government 's repression - the opposition in the country has been constrained , with dissidents effectively silenced .
Many were sent to exile or in jail , killed or driven to the walls of the desert .
But that could change .
`` If you suppress people and those none other options have to protest , it breaks out , '' said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
The whole of the youth is protesting .
A generation is protesting .
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to the stranglehold of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticized election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 % of parliament .
At the same time , tensions along the border with Eritrea rise ; a fight for this zacky , disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogades National Liberation Front , which in recent years have been forced more or less , would exploit the turmoil and could be armed again .
Several factors explain why feelings of seclusion are now exploding under the surface in the face of years .
The first seems harmless : Smartphones .
Only in the last few years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media , as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common , and improved Internet services .
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , which she does at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people still can communicate about Internet proxies hiding where they are .
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered so to protests .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since Aronas , the amharas , which come from an ethnic majority of the Christian Highlands , in the politics and the economy , while exploiting the Oromos , many of which are Muslim and live in lowlands .
But that too is changing .
`` We are here to coordinate under one umbrella , '' said Mulasu Gemechu , a leader of the Oromos .
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigridge , which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , the intelligence services , trade and politics .
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was until his death in an unpublicised disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia 's prime minister .
He was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think corners .
Analysts say he was particularly averse to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special agents to handle opponents and make them unharmed .
`` The current regime lacks this fundamental skill , '' said Mr Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopia 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles .
Unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam arrives south .
Analysts say he does n't enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray .
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a stir was in 2005 , after thousands of elections protested , apparently concealed by the government and subsequently stolen .
During the ensuing razor , many protesters were killed , even if they were less than in the last few months , and that time the riots went relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty .
But obviously this has not prevented the deepening of the Ethiopian Government 's internal misfortunes .
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month , protesters in Gondar , an amorphous city , from Tigray 's run , and the hate to the Tigrray are becoming more common in social media .
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for dronenflights over the neighbouring Somalia , even though it recently shared that it has closed this base .
While the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
`` This , '' Mr Abdi said , `` is a very thin grass drain . ''

Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS brand is supposed to be reduced to a backoffice role , according to the bank 's default .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank 's global ambitions .
The Bank has since distanced itself when she had almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago .
At this time , Markenstadists used `` RBS '' to protect other end-of-the-art retail trade marks .
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorships , from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now it has decided to focus on more national brands .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all RSB references , the decentralised headquarters and stock exchange will change to NatWest .
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will receive more importance - Coutts Bank , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's Military Bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and staff in Inverness-shire .
He shared the BBC Scotland with : `` The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we will now become more a bank of brands . ''
When the bank became a global brand , RBS became the global brand .
I am saying now that we are pursuing not global targets but local objectives .
Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
RBS has already announced that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
`` It is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? '' Said the CEO .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that these brands had been launched .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
We can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

For the 58-year-olds , it was a premiership .
Chio : 'Golden sports pyramid ' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes , the horses were reminded of their holiday , they were hunting at home to feed .
A kilometre at that pace , I was afraid .
`` It was n't a good experience , '' says Langer .
And so the riding career ended again .
On Saturday , Germany 's best golfers of all time - 101 tournament victories - were once again close to horses .
He left with his family about the ALRV facility , on a horse he was not interested in photography .
Long was the first time in Aachen and the CHIO .
The reason was quite convincing .
The German sports support was handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid .
There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete .
Bundesverwaltkreuz , Silver Lorbeerblatt , Champions Tour player of the year ...
Even the British Queen has already posted it .
Long is the 18th anniversary of the sport pyramid .
In Aachen , he met first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday .
`` This award means a great deal , '' says Langer , `` she is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social engagement . ''
For decades , Langer has been promoting aftergrowth .
And so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equally .
With 15 other outstanding athletes , the two-fold US Masterwoman was added to the `` Hall of Fame of the German Sports '' on Saturday .
The recordings include the athletics of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt , the Turner Eberhard Gienger , the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch , Alexander Puch and Arnd Schmitt , the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe , Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer , the Judoka Frank Wieneke , the sprint of Alwin Schackemöle and postman of the craftsman Erhard Wunderlich .
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
After the official part , the Fidelity company emigrated to the Springstadium , where the Lavazza Prize was running .
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals .

Pokémon Go , a hunt for health and happiness worth seeing
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
That teens and children are no longer to go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens , has been complained by many over the last decade .
At Pokemon Go , it 's about getting people from the sofa to get more active .
The time at the screen was initially confined to the TV , then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones .
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I am , of course , referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn , an app based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s ( a cartoon series , game cards and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , interest declined before the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
The launch of the market in other countries has been delayed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded .
Within a few days , Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons , who are tracked with a GPS and , once found , `` photographed '' ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or `` captured . ''
A generation playing the game , when she was even younger , joined the win and jumped for the sofa .
In the US , the game led to a significant rise in steps that the `` average '' person put back every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch , which tracked 35,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game 's launch , the number of subsequent people , who train every day for 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
The company does n't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for the performance increase .
A lot of public awareness-raising campaigns on health , who want to get people to `` take 30 minutes , '' `` from the sofa to come '' and `` active every day , '' because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look elend .
Nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be overvalued .
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of becoming sick of cancer or depression .
Physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
But the Wonderful of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
Three pillars of health cover - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
Some people close to hunting even new friendships .
As always , there are men 's players who always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could run against a door .
What ?
A breakthrough occurred .
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had previously been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports like this game .
The new one will lose its charm and use it with time .
However , thanks to Pokemon 's success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world , helping many people to hunt , active , fitter and healthier .

Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star of the plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the startling of the plejades .
The new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotated in the star clusters as well as in the context of rotation periods .
`` We hope that by comparing our results with other starches , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even history of his solar system , '' said Luisa Rekull , a researcher at the Caltech 's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The star of the plejades lies 445 light years from Earth .
Many stars in this starry , which emerged about 125 million years ago , now reach the adult age .
They are now turning to the fastest .
At peak rotation rates , these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds .
As these winds travel through the star 's magnetic fields , they have a brake effect on the stars .
When a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measured the rotational rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star dome -- such as sunglasses -- .
The latest catalogue of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
Rethull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pirouts turn up as smaller ones .
`` In the '' Ballet `` of plejacks , we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive , while more rapid rotors tend to be very bright stars , '' Reull said .
It is the ideal cosmopolitan laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
`` The star shooting of the plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , '' Reull said .
There is still a lot of things we would like to know more about , how the How , When and Why Stars slow their rotation rates and hang their `` dance shoes . ''
Rethull and her colleagues have extensively reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the plejades that will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal .

Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephale : 'It gets better '
Like most six-year-olds , Edmund Picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
But like the least of his contemporaries , Edmund microcephale , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did nothing during her pregnancy .
When he first came home , my first thought was that I did not do that .
I do not .
I did not admit it .
What 's not true -- of course , it 's been up to it , `` she said .
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund will never be able to recognize her and that he might not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalising it .
`` My first answer to that was ' I did n't know that people still do , ' '' explained Picciuto .
Edmund can run through a salary .
Edmund could neither sit nor craved until his third year of life and he still can not speak .
But he is making slow progress .
He can run with support and cycling .
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund for `` Please call me something before ''
`` We bring it to him , '' told Picciuto CBS News .
But it is not a typical sign language -- says it .
Microcephale has a variety of causes : Genetic like at Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy .
Symptoms and predictions may vary greatly .
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those affected by the Zikavius .
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I always asked what will happen ?
What will happen ?
And she still does n't really know .
I have n't been asking for a long time because I do n't expect anyone to really tell me .
But Picciuto has had a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus .
It 's getting better .
You know that it will be better for you .
You 'll love your kid and your kid will love you .

London schoolgirl headed to ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS , reportedly died in Syria .
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family were getting off her death in Raqqa , Syria a few weeks ago .
It was believed to have been killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa , the group 's bullying , reported ITV News on Thursday .
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had ordered her to leave the war-torn country and return to England .
`` One can only hope that the only good is - as a reminder and warning to others that this is the risks associated with it , to go into a war zone - people from ever going to take that decision , '' said Akunjee .
In February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London rose in a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultanas family has been told she has cured an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months to widow .

What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmers Markus Deibler has commented on Facebook 's disappointing cuts to the DSV team at Olympis .
In December of 2014 , he was awarded gold for the first time in Doha .
Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler via Facebook has put protection against his ex-team mates .
`` In a country in which an Olympians get 20,000 €premium and a jungle king £150,000 should n't be surprised , '' said the 26-year-old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page .
The support system in swimming is bad , but the doping controls are very good .
In this way , we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not see or even pursue doping .
`` I am not saying that the controls are to be stopped here , '' he added .
Wanted to launch a comeback would have to be Deibler had to be notified nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency ( NADA ) .
That is the way it should be with countries .
`` Anyone who can not be controlled at a time before WADA / FINA is not allowed to take part , '' asks the choice of Hamburg , which is now running an ice cream .

Simone Biles creates gold in the dam
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is on all that immune .
Dynamically on the sprunken .
Effortlessly on the bar .
Stunning on the ground .
On whole line brilliant .
And now , at last , Olympic Champion .
The 19-year-old American Turner climbed to the multiplayer title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the face of the Olympics .
Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and `` Final Five '' team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina .
The American women 's Simone Biles turnt on the Sweet during the men 's section of the women in the arts tournaments at the Summer Olympics Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-match title and overall the fifth , while consolidating her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment was ending .
This success puts them into the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated her sport 's last three years , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that involve a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescues of her said she was `` the best turner I ever saw . ''
She expected a final exam in Brazil , a contest that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over-dimensional expectations .
Not having a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be seen as disappointment .
The American women Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman tumbled off after they have won gold and silver in the women 's singles in the arts tournaments at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation mark on the relegation ceremony of the team co-ordinator Martha Karolyi .
Although Biles insisted on it , during her long way to the top , never planned the future , that 's not really true .
Part of their floor exercises - which includes their typical Tumbling Pass - is aligned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
This is no accident .
This girl , who has been adoptioned by her grandparents as a small kid and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans 's mother during a school outing , in which Boorman trained , became the force .
It has not lost any more competition since the summer of 2013 , a set of victories that will continue as long as Biles wishes .
Even though Mustafina was slightly guided by two shoots , the picture sounded .
Swedes and Bodenburg - in which Biles holds the World Championship title .
She picked up again with 15,433 on the Sweet again - and still has a 15,933 on the ground .
Raisman breathed them gently when they expected their final wound - a pure formality - and tears flowing on Biles 's glossy red , white and blue Eyeer than the vision she once described in her collection book .
The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina .
This time , the 22-year-old number of teams , called `` Oma , '' had a lead .
After her floor exercise , she threw the audience Kouswede , overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared dubious .
As far as Biles is concerned , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning :

Clinton earns 10.75 million in 2015 and figures 34.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax returns for 2015 on Friday , which found a $ 10.75 million income of $ 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 % .
In 2015 , Clinton donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $ 5.3 million in redeonoraries ; the former secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the Foreign Ministry .
Clinton 's candidate for the vice-president , Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia , shared his tax returns over the past decade with his wife Anne Holton .
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
`` Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , '' Clinton 's campaign manager Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion .
In a stark contrast , Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backbenchers on his previous promises to release his tax returns .
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , even though they are not obliged to do so .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for refusing to do so .
`` They 're on the train , '' wrote Clinton 's campaign heroine Ian Sams on Twitter , citing the Democratic nominee 's release .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump 's special adviser , told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax exams were not completed .
Trump 's critics , including the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 Mitt Romney , have already conceded that his refusal raises questions about assets , his donations for charitable organizations , his business and various other ties , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already jumped on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday , in the senior , in the senior , urging Trump to release his tax statement .
On Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
`` He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the last few decades and to publish his tax returns , '' she said to the crowd .
Politico has reported that Trump did not pay any or only very little taxes during the 1990 `` s for two years , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax earners and tax advisers on Friday , saying that might still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett , which would ensure that those more than $ 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 per cent .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska called Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has his seat here to exchange Trump for a meeting on their tax returns .
Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax review of the IRS and Trump had `` fear '' before voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has published tax returns until 2007 .
The Clintons , who are now living in Chappaqua , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of around 32 per cent between 2007-2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
The Clinton Tax Statement of 2015 showed that these only $ 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most Americans .
Its main success was a cost-effective index fund , from which the Clinton 's dividend and yields were to $ 109,000 .

Police : 3 victim in serial killer incident at music hearing in car shot
According to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series mortar case of Phoenix , while they kept in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance , authorities said .
The perpetrator humbled eight shots from a handgun weapon while standing on the passenger 's side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is to read in the report .
Police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery , as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 who was in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix Sgt . Jonathan Howard said the shooting was giving investigators a closer look at whether they are linked to four previous attacks .
In total , in Hispanic residential areas , seven people were killed and two more injured in nine attacks within four months .
`` It happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , '' shared Howard of the KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , earlier this month .
It is believed to have used several vehicles , including a brown Nissan from the late 1990 `` s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Maleah still died on the ground .
One witness told police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and hear music .
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting , which targeted an empty pickup truck a half-hour before the triple murder and assumed it was the work of the serial killer .
Investigators found patron enclosures and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room .

Volkswagen is still gliding through .
Despite diesel scandals , delivery figures are rising worldwide .
But it is not running in all markets .
In the case , there is confusion about a term .
Volkswagen will start the deliveries in the second half of the year .
In spite of its many brands and some well-running markets , Europe 's largest car can continue to show its biggest car .
In July , however , the Volkswagen nuclear brand weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again had a heavy burden of sales , as the company listed in the Dax listed company .
Worldwide , the VW brand sold 1,449100 cars in July , 1.8 percent less vehicles than the previous year .
In Western Europe alone , according to China , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
In the home market of Germany , deliveries to almost one-sixth fell .
Markenverdidief Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe .
In addition , in some core markets , a `` changing economic environment '' has given a purchase order .
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote to leave the EU has also been charged , a spokeswoman said .
In the United States , where the exhaust flashes first escalated , there is also a minus .
Great support for VW is the Chinese market .
In total , the largely affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is already with the diesel scandal : After the first seven months , only a 0.9 per cent increase to 3.37 million vehicles is to be found .
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to show a sales gap between January and July .
1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had rigged with a software Aggery .
In Germany alone , VW is calling for approximately 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
In the course of rearmament , VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact .
After the conversion of vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power will not deteriorate .
The bus station offers customers a `` guarantee '' certificate , but not of a `` guarantee , '' as was said on Friday in company trips .
The reason for this is legal immunity .
The `` Focus '' had reported that Volkswagen would now guarantee its German customers a guarantee of equipped diesel models .
This would have been confirmed last Monday VW-Representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
The Department of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
`` VW has met the obligations of my investigative commission and the KBA . ''
Said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) .
VW has taken the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power will not deteriorate after upgrading , and all the type-approval-related vehicles remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term `` guarantee '' but not how it was called in business trips .
The broad concept of `` guarantee '' makes Volkswagen the possibility that , for example , customers could come to a shop for six months after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software - even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
It is also important for us to avoid , in the interests of our clients , that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the Abgassandal , will lead to uncertainty as regards the possible guarantee arrangements , as stated .
For this reason , VW does not use the term `` guarantee . ''

Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrians hurt - multiple dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll , Friday morning .
She had suffered cuts and was treated in hospital , but had already been able to leave it again .
Her home trip was scheduled for early September .
Whether from the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern towns of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens , it is still unclear .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities .
Hua Hin , located about 200 miles south of the capital Bangkok , was initially exploding two bombs on Thursday night .
According to police , a Thailand was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrians , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning , two pitfalls were again high , and another man was killed .
A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning .
A taxi driver was injured in the shooting near the nearby town of Patong .
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country , then another bomb exploded , killing a municipal employee .
The assaults were put into the air , according to the authorities in a floral beets before the coast police moved to the air .
Finally , detectives in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and Chumphon on the south-east coast claimed several injured .
A connection with the explosions in Hua Hin said it was .
`` The bomb attacks bear the same handwriting , '' said Army director Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning .
`` We expect it to be a coordinated attack . ''
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media , too , wanted to identify a pattern typical for the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
Thai police , on the other hand , said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism .
`` That 's just local sabotage , which is limited to limited areas and provinces , '' a spokesman said in Bangkok .
Rather , the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid down .
The authorities would have received intelligence advice on imminent attacks in the South of the country in the past few days - but they were not informed about the exact timing and locations .
It is still unclear what group behind the attacks .
Police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amusement areas .
There are still smaller bombings in Thailand , but they are mostly not against tourists .
In Hua Hin , a palace was used over the years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
The Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , on its homepage , is strongly recommending that the Thai security authorities be informed .
High security risk ( 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihen and its surroundings .
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations , they are not going to travel to these provinces .
Increased security ( level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday were few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta .
It also gives strong influence to the military in the years to come .
Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-lo-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to stifle chaos , while moving towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism .
The military unta , which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , is helping itself to restore stability and order .
However , the military has not been able to control Muslim rebels in the far south of the country .
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
Barely a year ago , in Bangkok , an attack on a popular Hindu shrine was killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
It was the bloodiest attack of the country 's younger history .

31 years for clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Funding Federation , Ruppert Göller , is retiring .
The association is regarded as `` Bavarian . ''
A small frantic drinking water station as an example for the large water producers .
This was the name of the Bayerischer Rundfunk some time ago .
Little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Frankonia was awarded the purpose board .
The work of the Veig group is `` Bavarian as exemplary . ''
Behind all this is Rupert Göller , who was 31 years in the Zielband employee , 28 years as managing director .
Now he was retired at the age of 65 .
The water-purpose Federation of the Veig group , based in Kottendorf , Municipality Breitbrunn , promotes approximately 150000 cubic metres of water every year and provides for 32 places and females with about 5500 inhabitants .
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlouder , Breitbrunn , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach .
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts .
The current chairman , Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water supplier in 1985 and was appointed as the Managing Director of the Zielverband in 1988 .
`` His tasks have been very diverse and they covered water pipeline construction and maintenance work through office and organization activities , budgeting , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends , '' the chairperson said .
As an outstanding event , she called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , plots of land in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the rehabilitation of the high-container ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re-introduction of water pipelines .
There has been no stalemate , and there have always been innovations because water is a means of life and drinking water is the most important food .
In her Laudatio , she praised Göller 's faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water base and he has always lived in the water-purpose association as if it were its own business .
A few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he has been able to present the concept of success of the group to the water forum in the district of Lower Frankonia .
He received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Rupert Göller , for his part , praised Alfons Griebel , who worked with him for 28 years .
He is the best Wasser and he was a faithful cone .
Together we were an unbeatable team .
As a highlight from his point of view , he referred to the cultivation of Brunnen and the restructure of the destination .
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the crash in the blast container at Kirchlouder on 3 January .
At minus 17 degrees the whole night will have to work , so that the towns could be cared for .
You can only maintain the supply of Neubrunn because you have been filled with hoses from Pettstadt .
The management of the Drinking Water Works Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter , who took up the succession of Rupert Göller .

Traveller Ian Wright shouted for a travel guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller withdrew his immune system and diggereflex of serious scrutiny - by sending out some of Europe 's dirtiest and ecclesious places .
The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk , shouted his course on a Euro-shone , a gunman on Piccadilly Circus , a towing of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system .
Before taking any object , he used a luminometer to stand up and to show what he will get .
But the experiment , which was filmed under the title `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' brought some surprise results to light .
The idea to sniff off the flip button of a tractor that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely abortive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen cupboard .
On his journey through Europe , Commissioner Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Darmbakteries and his own health .
Fortunately , nothing he left , more than a bad taste in the mouth .
Mr Wright was known to try to test the resistance of his intestine by taking advantage of the world and dreaming about it .
From public change to train stations to sprubs of toilets , the task put his immune system definitely under a sample
In the film he told : `` Already as a kid I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all possible things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film , he became fair to his reputation .
The only thing he opposed was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
His sampling showed a luminometer of more than 4000 units .
Compared to this , the luminometer is freshly washed hands less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to leak after its luminometers were more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film `` The Lockhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' which shows the bacterium 's number in different locations such as the bathroom
In the film , he says : `` That comes close to the worst I 've got in a toilet . ''
There is nothing more harmful than that !
I am not going to see anything here because it is outrageous .
`` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio .
The company supplies Mr Wright with Valio Karrius , which includes both dairy and Vitamin C and D to support the promotion of Darmbakteries and the immune system .
Valios senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` We wanted to really offer consumers something new .
Something that is fascinating to see and also explains the benefits of probiotics .
We caused crazy Brainstorms , which ended up saying that we told `` Let Us Ian call . ''
They claim the interest in colorectal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of colorectal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in colorectal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom HAKALA , who led the film 's director , added : `` Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had caught some of the things I instructed him to lick , as the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film . ''
Of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to sniff them and others where this was quite difficult .
I 'm glad we have included some of these dirty leaks on film. ``
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio , 84 percent of all respondents , particularly with the well-being of Magen and Darm and 58 percent , said that at least they occasionally use products containing accompanying dairy bacteria .

Frankie Dettori reaches pressor his 3,000th win at Newmarket
Dettori spray champagne after a double at Newmarket , bringing him 3,000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday .
He set to predilection , trained by John Gosden , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggod , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
The three-time winner Dettori , who won at Ghayyar , said : `` It 's something special . ''
I 'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago .
It 's not a big meeting , it 's not Royal Ascot - it 's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I 'm relieved and very modest .
Dettori takes the jubilee when he picks up victory
Two jockeys reached the milestone in the impeachment race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-painted winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who scored more than 4,300 wins in a rebound career .
Lester Piggod , the nine-member Derbywinner had 4,493 career talent
Frankie is one of the best jockey of the modern era and it is no surprise that he has achieved this milestone , which has reached just a few .
He has style and is strong , but it 's his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
He 's a fantastic ambassador for race , his enthusiasm and charisma thrilled fans for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked 6,000 wins if he would n't just be a weekend and big tournament jockey !
Frankie already has nearly 30 years in GB , which is great .
He has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From the Flying finisher to Flying Dismots , Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
It was nervous .
A whole series of great turnovers , including his famous `` Glorious Sieben '' in Ascot in 1996 , also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
Three years ago , he initially had trouble when he returned from his six-month-old lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubters and return to his bride .
And he 's still far from the end - Dettori said earlier that he would want to carry on in competitions up to his minimum 50.th life year .

Once squeezed over price from the market , comes cafe in Greenpoint
The staff were very friendly and helpful .
Of course , prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladies Front have been squeezed out .
The business Soap Cherie , the verb , invented in the summer of 2014 , sold soap in the form of cupcakes .
Indigenous mourned it as the last loss in a gentrified city .
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , `` I know New York is changing , but I still can not believe that CBGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business . ''
But if New York is changing , then it 's also reinvention .
A revived verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint , less than a mile north from its original location .
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly narrow atmosphere .
The coffee is still good .
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a longtime employee of the old cafe , owner and manager of the new cafe .
He started working in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
When he offered a client to provide money for a new outlet , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , spared a great deal .
Verb used the same distributor for the badge bought the same espresso model .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
He introduced new ingredients .
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnings like captains and sauted onions .
There are nature-making .
The café serves no more beer , there are fresh juices .
After nine months , Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
`` Many old customers have also been driven by prices from Williamsburg , '' he said .
Recently on one Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg earlier .
Even after she was pulled to Greenpoint , she would take the path .
After the verb had closed , they gave up the coffee rings a while , she said .
`` I became clear that it was in the coffee and in the culture in the verb that I liked , '' she said .
Now she 's drinking again coffee , even if she ordered a pencil Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Caffee .
Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
He went there before the job and always ordered him to die .
`` I came out of quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter , '' he said .
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu .
Nowadays , Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said he did not agree that the soap business has taken the old business room .
In fact , the owner of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for verb with the coffee of coffee as a ingredient .
`` I think we 're going to go back to their offer , '' Rodriguez said .
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe .
A new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodriguez said he had pretending to put it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
The location also has further advantages .
A local juice locally wants to fill and sell cold-fried coffee .
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighbouring building .
For many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favourites .
Joseph Witt was tribal and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
When the new cafe opened , Whitt said that the subject of the locomotive and the bearer was feeling a new coffee as a home return .
`` I had to smell that , '' he said .

The US wins fourth match in women 's field hockey , a showdown with Britain faces
One day after she had shot three gates during a six-1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the women 's field-hopping team in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won 3-0 .
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but Bam ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever .
`` I have no idea , '' she said .
I am not one of the people who kept their doors in mind .
But they know : The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic race , and they are in their group with the Britons on the first place , which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet in the final round of the first round on Saturday .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place .
The first burst will be a little longer off the road that will lead the other group .
Whatever the game on Saturday , the Americans have caused a surprise agony , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 seats .
BAM was part of this team .
She grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years a hockey sleigh in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the US , the youngest in the team 's history .
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could n't qualify for the box .
Then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went wrong .
The following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better .
`` A cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , '' said Bam .
We did not have the working sum in London that we now have .
We have been able to take the helm completely .
On Thursday night , Bam opened the torrents in the first half of the game with a backlash from the close range .
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands .
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved into the middle and invited the ball to give the Americans a 2-0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
The Shutout was the first of all of the tournament for the United States , Jackie Briggs , which has so far had a gate in each of the previous games .
She 's got a run .
Just like Bam .
`` We 're in a good position , '' said Parnham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .

Urbach : Annika Deusle is new refugee officer
Annika Deusle is the contact person in the field of integration and organizer .
She is also a social worker on the ground .
Since July , Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach .
The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger .
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors : Refugees , the Intervention of Refugee Assistance , the administration , the authorities and anyone else .
Regine 's customer from the working circle suggests that the honorary official is more than grateful that Deasle is now there , the iron-grade wool mill , which is above all a problem .
Some - less spotless than in fact - meant that the number of requests had to be replaced when the administration wanted to write .
An administrative professional with a talent for languages and people has been sought , coupled with a long-term experience in the field of social work , which is an iron-milder .
But administrative work is not their central area , says Annika Deusle .
Above all , it is about organizing , work with people on the ground and behind the scenes and network activities .
The 31-year-old has been in existence for about six weeks .
It has a 50 per cent point in three years .
`` It was high time , '' says Regine Kunde , which supports Annika Deishle and principal actors .
There are large and small problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
Soon new containers in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been found for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised .
Local authorities are responsible for connecting them .
They must shelter the refugees in their own or rented homes .
The cost of building , rent or renovating these accommodation must bear the local authorities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the landing board to commune and job center .
Problem : There are free objects , but not every rental wants to offer its apartment .
The search has been proving very difficult for some time .
De facto , the administration does not find private housing .
It does n't work so far , however , if you need to rely on private apartments , so Deasure .
Public housing must therefore be intimidated , as is so beautiful .
So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße .
But only with housing is not done .
Perspective is the keyword , are Regine Kunde and Annika Deusle agreed .
In addition to a firm lead , there are traineeships , training centres , school grounds , Euro-euro jobs and assistance to refugees and migrants who have to be folded or established .
`` More places would be good , '' says Regine customer .
Many work in the building house or help house master , perform charitable work - and the motivation and very well , as Annika Deusle reports .
She hopes that work for the community will lead to positive external action .
That is ' not employment therapy ' .
But activity does n't just mean work .
The day needs a solid structure , say Deishle and customer .
People should develop a sense of belonging .
So there need to be offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
Professional courses are rr .
This is also where administration and honorary official are jumping .
It is vital that refugees get the feeling that they are hoping and welcome in Germany .
The long duration of proceedings is a problem .
They need to explain to the refugees that it will take time and that they can make sense , for example with language courses .
Anyone who creates the feeling that he ca n't help in Urbach can not work and is pointless .
The clear majority is motivated .
However , problems exist , says clients honestly , `` people who do nothing at all . ''
All this is a `` mammoth task . ''
A difficult question : Have the two people afraid of radicalization , also in a small community like Urbach ?
`` No , '' says Regine Kunde .
The aid workers are made aware .
These events are also about refugees .
Those would have been afraid that the perpetrators of the attacks would be completely discredited .
`` They want to show that they have nothing to do with that , '' says Regine customer .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
It is therefore important to keep the local and the volunteers on the ground and in the region .
They always found that a new stop to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach .
Does Germany need a cap ?
To answer this question clearly , politics is shy .
It is unfair to put them on the ground .
`` In Urbach , we are not there yet , '' says Annika Deusle .
No new refugees , that would ease the situation .
Regine 's customer also makes it clear that the former companies are already busy integrating the existing people .
This is currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
But if people are in need , they need to help , both women agree .
The political world is so complicated , there are no easy answers .

Clinton and Trump 's economic policy compared : It 's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP - that is what both Clinton and Trump want .
However , the two US presidential candidates are opposed to tax and energy policy and to a fundamental question .
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamental , rather philosophical .
Of the state .
Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to cut the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
He himself would be quite different , Trump said .
He will have a massive return on regulations and he is strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower rates - for private and business .
Clinton , on the other hand , says that the State has certain tasks to do , opening up opportunities and spending money on it .
That is why taxes on the rich would be increased , she says .
Interestingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
To invest in it , Trump and Clinton say almost exactly .
The Democratic Applicant announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policies , and are firmly rejected by Republicans , for example , by the government 's government .
So , on Trump , there could still be bipartisan discussions .
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restore coal mining in the US again .
Oil extraction should also be possible in protected areas , the Paris climate agreement will announce it .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand its investment program explicitly to expand and call for `` a country to become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs . ''
`` It 's probably going to be China , Germany or America - I want us to be . ''
But not only with the infrastructure - including international trade agreements - the two competitors are not too distant .
TPP , the transient trade deal , do not want to sign .
At the same time , both , however , do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs .
They are to be paid better , and for about Clinton .
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 was a famine .
It wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear : Once he says , the minimum wage needs to be reversed , then he says he must not be changed .
But the big discussion of the next few months is likely to develop rather than the two camps .
On the one hand , Trump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , is to boost growth .
His critics think he would only increase the budget deficit .
On the other hand , Clinton , who , at least , wants to ask the wealthy to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : More taxes are not the solution either .

The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is asking for wealthy savers in the future - as the second Institute in Germany .
Bank chief executive Josef Paul said on Thursday : `` It 's just about 139 customers , who park around EUR 40 million on giro- or daily cash accounts . ''
The Bundesverband German Banks speaks of an isolated case and does not send a signal : Ordinary savers should not fear to pay for their sparkles .
Camps banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
This fee is required by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over EUR 100 000 to be paid on Giro- or daily cash accounts .
`` The first 100,000 euros are free . ''
Said Paul .
He has had some EUR 40 million for some time , which could be raised from one day to another and which he can not accept .
`` They are up to me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , '' the bank chief said .
`` I can not put aside for every million EUR 4000 . ''
After the 'polluter pays ' principle , the costs are now continuing .
If the cash is to be left in the gates of the Raiffeisenbank , it would be far too dangerous to say : `` I have already experienced four incidents , not even the fifth ! ''
Most customers would understand and changed to other forms of investment .
Few emigrated to other banks .
The Bavarian Cooperatives Association said : `` The ECB 's extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs on all banks . ''
To bear it alone is not `` economically viable . ''
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or remittances .
With penalty interest rates for deposits from three million euros , the Thuringian Volks- and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kemmer , chief executive of the banking association , said : `` We do n't expect private customers to pay nationwide charges on deposits , to do so , competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks . ''
A banker said at the Tegernsee Lake there is `` a clientele that is quite abundant in wealth . ''
`` That can be a problem for a small bank , '' if she 's free money .
The co-operative bank Gmund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wiesee , Rottach-Egern , Kreuth and Tegernsee .
In the region , there are known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
The Bavarian Cooperative Federation `` is currently not aware of any further banks that charge an outlet for deposits of private customers , '' spokesperson Ernst said .
The president of the Federal Association of German People 's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks ( BVR ) , Uwe Fröhlich , said at the end of June that the threshold to go into the negatives is very high .
The competition is tough , and it droit the emigration of investors to competition .
The customers in Germany will not be allowed to fall into the width .

Future of Portland smashed due to repeal of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland 's aluminium melts in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake , as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and will thus lift all the delivery contracts , as the energy company supplied .
This step followed the government 's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies to operate the facility .
A subsidy for 20 years expires in November .
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake .
Less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
Moreover , it could result in domino effects , as the meltdown consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation .
In 2014 , Alcoa closed Point Henry , which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year .
The meltdown of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure .
This follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and , last but not least , the electricity price .
AGL , which supplies the large aluminium meltdown with its Loy Yang A Power Plant in Latrobe Valley , said that three other owners will terminate their contracts .
The facility is in the majority possession of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina , of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp maintain smaller shares .
`` AGL assumes that the port will continue to operate in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity through the meltdown , '' the company shared .
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called `` safeguards '' to enter into force from November 2016 .
The Treaties have a 12-month notice period , so they will end in 2017 .
`` Therefore , AGL assumes that the Treaties will contribute 17 to the revenue in fiscal year , '' the electricity supplier said .
All potential effects on the revenue to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the projections of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its $ 187 million contract in `` expectation of a termination . ''
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts , the `` ability of alcoas ... to run the meltdown or to guarantee the power supply to the meltdown '' does not affect it .
The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , who should have entered into force from November this year , even though it is still guilty of why it resigned from the Treaty .
Analysts are warning about the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle .
Referring to the analysts ' statements earlier this week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland spends about 600 megawatts annually and Tomago consumes about 900 megawatts of electricity .
Should both plants disappear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in demand for the [ electricity market ] .
And for us as an electricity producer , that would not be good , `` he said .

Rain instead of star snow : Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-snowing wickets in southwest Germany on the night to Friday a stranger through the bill - but there is still hope .
The night , because of clouds and rain , could have been ill-suited to observe the celestial sphere , said the President of the Sternwarte Welzheim , Hans-Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday .
The weather is supposed to be good , then we can see many star snows on the sky .
The asterisks are perseidae , which , with 216,000 kilometers per hour , belong to the fastest star .
Their names have them because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus , which runs north-east .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the trainer 's cancer to rudder victory
There will be no emotine gold than in those games , and that is what you want .
From the first slide to the last , 220 hard Hieve that came into history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa .
The Echo of the trainer Robin Williams was here as she was a second Olympiagold in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British Sports , which laid such a benchmark .
Her dominance was absolutely , after all , its 39th unsuspecting bet , which is also unprecedented .
What we are seeing are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal .
Behind every gold in the rudder , a Batamillon is stuck to willing heroines that contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and it was no euthanising than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
As he said , he was risky .
I had bladder cancer , which is operable and they did .
If you do n't do that , he spreads everywhere .
It would have been a pretty bad situation .
It changes a little to the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back again .
It was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
That 's how it starts .
It is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one .
In the insufficiency of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerving morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
Stanning , who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an effort in Afghanistan , said `` I was an emotional wreck this week , which is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . ''
It just repeats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin worked .
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin , we would be no one , and therefore a massive thank him to him .
I would have no better person to train or better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years .
The couple had a tough rhythm , with which their opponents could n't compete .
Even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to finish , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were caught very at the moment .
Helen called `` leaded in the process , sustained in the process . ''
It is really important not to let go .
We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make something rabies .
We did not want a fireworks today , we simply wanted to achieve a good result , go beyond and win the race , which we did .
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glover will have to appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall .
Now she simply wants to enjoy the moment .
I did n't want to say that was my last race .
That would have caused excessive pressure .
In London , it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
It was all so new to me and I was so stressful .
Here it took about four minutes .
That feels so much better , `` she said .

Despite doping : These athletes still have medals chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already blocked twice because of doping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whistlebuwerin Julia Stepanowa may not start in Rio .
Others overled athletic sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
The issue of doping still determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics .
The Russian swimming woman Julija Jefimowa , who had complained to her Starlaw shortly before the Games , was unearthed and cancelled at her start ( 100 metres ) .
It offered a scurial scenario : She was still proud of her appearance and had provoked her appearance .
As a firm that she was not going to catch gold , the audience broke into a jubilee .
But there are many more athletes who , despite the doping past , go to the Rio Olympics .

Culture of Political Correctness leaves voter fraud in Muslim neighborhoods
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luttum Rahman was arrested last year on trial of a government report on corruption
A culture of Political Correctness has caused widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities to knowingly ignore what a devastating government report has revealed today .
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is attacking police , election observers , and council houses to have ignored evidence of voter abuse due to `` obesity and religion . ''
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti-corruption member , said intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up landlords outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters .
He recommends that voters should hold a card to prove their identity in elections .
At the moment , a voter only needs to name his name and address .
The report proposes that non-removable ink on the finger of a person should be issued if they give their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice .
Whistleblowers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official Comoros or Working Groups .
`` This is not just against voter fraud , but also seeks to protect the community government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that accompanies it , '' he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London .
Last year , a special panel ruled that the incumbent mayor , Mr Lutfr Rahman , should be removed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his duties .
The court found that Rahman would have had the religious feelings of its Muslim community `` in a cynical manner '' and that he had silenced his critics with racial and Islamophobia debt .
Rahman is supposed to have `` conducted his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it . ''
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation , where one person as someone else chooses .
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud across the country .
He said , in particular , alarming about the fraudulent exchange of letters - the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including the driving of expressions to prove the identity
His report states : `` As evidence was appropriate , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , in particular women and young people to choose , in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with a Pakistani or non-Muslim background .
`` There were concerns that ... State institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of '' politically correct `` over-sensitivity to the ethno and religion . ''
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists handle letter-voting documents to stop `` whistleblowers . ''
The report , considered by Theresa May , also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud .
Consider options to ask voters before the election .
Do n't use removable ink on a person 's finger as soon as she has delivered her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
Carry out systematic reviews of a person 's nationality to ensure they are eligible .
A three-year limitation to applications for an automatic letter .
Ban that political activists process complete letter elections and envelopes of letter elections .
The police have the power to set up closures around polling stations .
A legislative amendment facilitating an indictment of intimidation pursuant to the Representation of the People Act 1983 .
Shooting ban in polling stations .
Request that only English can be used in polling stations ( except Wales ) .
Stepping up training to make sure employees enforce the rule that voters alone go to the polling booth .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it `` amazing '' that after the Tower Hamlets case was not put to a stranger .
`` The Electoral Court has said Lutfor Rahman and his deputy for reasons of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices were deemed to be untapped , '' he said .
It has been found guilty by a number of reasons - in line with the high standards of criminal proceedings .
It also criticizes the ineffective `` abortion checks '' of voter registration departments .
Sir Eric said : `` The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal .
Our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation .

Rio 2016 : ROBEL Kiros Habite becomes internet hip
The Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympics .
This shows the bold appearance of ROBEL Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
In the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight swimsuit from Ethiopia was so slow that he was temporarily unable to see the TV pictures .
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
In social networks , Habte was subsequently used to go viral .
In fact , the 24-year-old finished with a delay of 48 seconds and ranked 59th place of 59 starter .
It was rather his not just athletic figure , which attracted attention from the international media .
Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics ?
The Ethiopians received a special ruling from the international pool .
This will be distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries known .
As the majority of athletes run , Habte wanted to do something else .
Preparation is all : ROBEL Kiros Habite is ready for the big race .
Quickly made the first nickname the round .
Some media called him `` ROBEL of the whale . ''
In addition to a `` welfare belly , '' the English tabloid `` The Sun '' made it funny .
His time , he suggested just one minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of freedom , played no part .
Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn .
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Moussambani 's run for median attention .
An unforgettable experience was the appearance of the swimming pool of Equatorial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a pre-run of 100 metres .
He was fired at the time .
The 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before Olympia and had never finished so long before the contest .

Data clau : So perfide invents hackers her ransom
Programmers of extortion Malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful .
According to a recent survey by the malware prevention specialists , Malwareytes , among 540 companies in North America , the United Kingdom and Germany , 40 per cent of the companies surveyed have been in the past 12 months at least once , in part , many of them victims of an attack with blackmail software .
In Germany , just 20 % of the companies were already committed to Ransomware blackmail .
40 per cent of the victims paid willingly the rangers demanded by the perpetrators to re-use the systems and data .
The perpetrators specifically specialise in their extortion software , according to the observations of Malwareyites , on attacks in company networks .
If they succeed there , the potentially far-reaching ranger is significantly higher than in private users .
`` We are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware , '' explains Malwareboy boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the `` world . ''
In 2008 , most Malwareprogrammes were still designed to send advertising .
Then the perpetrators discovered Erblackmail software for themselves .
Only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks has been appalling in recent months .
Ransomware works after a simple pattern : Once a victim 's computer is active , it is looking for recently modified files such as Word- , Excel or database files , and archives for images and videos .
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals .
The software then presents the demands of the extenders .
To get the final encryption code to get the files , the victim needs money - usually in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin .
However , where private users use the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is closed .
Accordingly , the damage is higher when a Ransomware is added .
22 percent of German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware , 13 percent had even had to interrupt business completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
In Germany , many hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospital records .
`` We always tell the victims : Does not pay , it will only promote the problem , '' explained Kleczynski .
But 80 to 90 per cent of the firms who pay will get their data back again .
For managers , it is difficult to reject the perpetrators `` demand , given the stalemate in the operation .
The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , F-Secure 's security researchers have been investigating the benefits of use and contact with the extenders , and come to the result : The perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
They explain their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bitcoin , sending freely accessible support websites or decrypt for example files .
And , as a result of payments from a few hundred euros , companies will have to negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted .
Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail , the hackers will always be professional and share the job , explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider Sophos : `` A single person can write a Ransomware about within a week . ''
However , it is more likely to be three or four people .
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software component to the actual extenders .
The previous malware kits emerged , by purchasing the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1,000 and $ 10,000 .
`` Included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and branding can be changed , '' says Wisniewski .
The exters then seek further hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
So , in one of the forums in the underground , you can buy the set of a criminal , and assign another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
The payment is made for a machine .
`` Usually the criminals then ask for spammers , '' says Wisniewski .
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data .
More than 50 percent of the companies in the Malwareytes survey trust Ransomware to be able to escape from file bag-ups and scanner software .
As a result , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
`` If the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful performance , the perpetrators will instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , '' explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski .
This means that the potential for damage is much higher than before .
In future , the perpetrators could , in future , have completely new objectives on the Internet .
At the Despacon conference Defcon , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet .
In the middle of winter , so many casualties could well be worth a ransom .
If the perpetrators were to block a whole production road in a factory , instead of the heating in the future , Ransomware could also become an issue in the industry 4.0 .

Disease : When the organiser pays
Once you have visited the hotel , you will be able to get back if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel .
However , this is only the case if more than ten per cent of guests have proven the same symptoms .
In the missed case , a family on the second day of their door to Turkey was severely affected by confusion and destruction .
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
Her illness caused holidaymakers to return to a defective treatment plant that allegedly polluted sea water .
The family was of the opinion that the journey was deficient - and against the organiser .
In court , the plaintiffs had no success .
The waste water treatment plant was indeed defective .
However , the organiser did not return to it until late .
He had to assume that the sea water was fine .
So he did not violate his information obligations , so the verdict .
No contamination has been found in the samples of the water .
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion - belonged to the general life risk .
Of 691 guests were only 38 .

Schotte Callum Skinner stormed home , as Brite Gold spends on cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner last night in the men 's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Evil .
England claimed a shocking victory over four years , while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals .
They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place in March , despite the resignation of Hoys , in March .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
They did so in time as a Hindu .
Hoy 's retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton sought to close .
Skinner was the man where she stayed when she saw potential in the Scots that has now emerged .
Hinder , Kenny - who scored four years ago with Hoy winner - and Skinner set up an Olympiarek in the qualification rounds , but in the standings the New Zealand won in the first round .
And the British trio won the duell with gold .
Hinder was barely back after his round , but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it .
A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation , in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and to allow Kenny and , above all , Skinner keep pace .
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner , Kenny and Hindes when they climbed to the podium .
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said : `` It 's a scary comparison . ''
I 'm just here to do my best and make a name .
We set up an Olympiarek and beat the world champion .
It was simply incredible .
There is no better way to win this .
After the 2012 triumph to the side of Kenys and Hoys , Hinder admitted that after a weak start , he deliberately fell to the train .
He moved that statement later and there was no objection from England 's rivals .
This time , this time , this is no such problem .
Hindes said : `` It feels with the whole GB flags on the grandstand like London . ''
We have met in the last three months as a team .
We have been so bad for so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
That is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
If that 's a barometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Velodrom .
With the form Kennys , it 's in the area of the possible that he 's repeated Hoys 's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister ) - mean an outages of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the same from Hoy .
Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said : `` I enjoy this only for the moment . ''
The team event is always the best .
You can win it with his colleagues .
It feels something lonely to win alone .
Hindes said : `` If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the Ritter . ''
It was the only medal contest of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-mile race .
They came in 3 : 51,942 on goal .
The world record , winning gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 51,659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) will take place today on the second day of the contest , where Wiggins will certainly be focused .
He had met with officers before qualification yesterday , when officials called themselves to measure his body size .
In the corresponding female competition , which will continue tomorrow and finish tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in Weltrek time in 4 : 13,260 .
The GB team is relying on its strong train cycling team to dominate the mid-term period of the Olympics and to catch a bowl of medals .
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were down .
Dramas played out in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sex and implosion allegations as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
However , if you look at the first night of the competition in the Velodrom , it looks like the now legendary name GBs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will again be repeated .

Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information , unveiling committee of Congress
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to mark a more optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it could have allowed the actual conditions on the ground , reported a committee of inquiry in a report on Thursday .
The preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee , intelligence agencies , and military-related communications , reports from great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how preliminary their assessments of the American effort changed in the fight against Islamic State .
The Central Command , briefly Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` Intelligence-based information , which was typically inspired by high-level CENTCOM commanders , regularly recorded a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground and were generally more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , '' a newspaper article quoted the report .
`` What happened to CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , '' said Ken Calvert , a Republican member of the House of Representatives .
The management errors in CENTCOM range up to the top of the organization .
The 10-page report reveals detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces .
While there is no direct evidence that government posts under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their predisposition to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State 's threat , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` During the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts '' set out the report .
For example , a CENTCOM member publicly disclosed that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015 .
Mossul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
`` After months of investigations , so much is clear . '' Said Mike Pompeo , Republican congressman from Kansas , in an opinion .
From the middle of 2014 to mid-2015 , the Central Command 's peaks changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger through ISIS in Iraq .
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after being attributed to analysts `` concerns about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue .
In addition , further investigations by the CENTCOM reports by the Ministry of Defence 's Advocate General are under way .
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday , which agreed with some of the Republican Task Force 's conclusions .
`` In the years of 2014 and 2015 , CENTCOM created an overly limited process for the establishment of intelligence assessments to ISIL and Iraqi security services , '' said the highest-level democrat in the Chamber , member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion .
That process , Mr. Schiff , `` delayed the release of intelligence reports , '' damaged the morality among analysts and `` gave overly little room for dissent . ''
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House 's intervention in the CENTCOM analysts about a `` certain political opinion . ''
Preliminary results of the congressional inquiry were published Tuesday by `` The Daily Beast . ''
Last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon 's general inspector , which were taken after complaints from CENTCOM analysts .
Lt. Cmdr Patrick Evans , a spokesman for the Pentagon , admitted in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on congressional reports , while the Chief Inspector 's investigation is still under way .
But he also admitted that `` experts sometimes have different opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . ''
The investigations have backlash over the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an allegation that is now being made by a growing number of defence ministry members ) .
But last year 's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
The criticism of obedience information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disobedience of more than ten years ago , when a CENTCOM analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a piece of paper about how the then-government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , foreshadowed only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
Last year , the team set up Mr. Hooker , according to government agencies , that , contrary to the government 's statements against the Islamic State-held refineries , no significant impact on the terrorist group 's financial position would have been in place , as these tentative refineries would have taken place to sell oil on the black market .
That finding , however , was not published , reported the Times in September .
Centcoms , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .

Assistant doctors dispute : Calls for new job fight
Deputies of assistants have called on their union to approve new anti-war measures in their disputes on a new contract .
The Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has called for its entire council to approve more work-related measures from the beginning of September .
The JDC said it would have said ministers had been asked to comment on concerns about the Treaty .
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA .
It was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night , JDC Ellen McCourt told the government that the government would remain `` stubbornly quiet '' on issues that resulted in the contract being rejected .
She said : `` In view of this , the JDC Board of Directors has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and have requested official renegotiation to all of the cases . ''
As a response to the government 's silence , the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labor action starting in early September .
The disputes led to the fact that assistant doctors had six occasions this year , the first overall failures in the history of the NHS .
The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA .
He shared BMA members during meetings which were still pending before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and should be adopted .
After the vote , Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced for doctors in England .

Tourists in Portugal to panic after a tipping military jet is overflying
Sunberries in Aveiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A portusitic P-3C Orion plane of air pressure put an incredible storm flight
Air forces said it was on a training flight , but insisted that no security risk was above
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a tipping jet crashed over a full beach .
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft almost flew over the sunk on the beach in Aveiro in northern Portugal .
The holidaymakers on , as they were understandably inclined , worried about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what the clouds arrived .
The incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-By in social media , said : `` It flew twice really very deeply and there was a moment when it looked as though it would crash . ''
Nuno Arroja added : `` I was just watching surfing and it felt like the plane would drop to me . ''
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of the dark and was incredibly deep
Portuguese air forces today said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to identify them .
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor viewing conditions , but the air pressure forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk .
Area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people being killed on the island of Madeira .
Portuguese air force forces today said the pilot had to fly so deeply , owing to conditions - strong fog and fire - which restricts his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Community , spirit , health : Singing does seniors well
The Singen has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life : As a young girl she was in the school choir , in the Lehtramt-studying she was the subject of music , and today the 78-year-old is singing in a seniors choir .
`` Singing moves me - emotionally and physically , '' she describes .
After a rehearsal she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says .
By the way , she is doing something good for her health and spirit .
Singen is a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hackler from the German seniors league .
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with peers the joy of the music , describing Hackler .
Through regular meetings , seniors can build and maintain social contacts .
Social and family structures are often solved at age , and a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir : `` Speak out and organize to leave on the other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association . ''
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense , says Hackler .
This is because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing .
If you ask your lungs on a regular basis , you ca n't get it out of the pusts .
Even if it 's about to get the sound of voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
On older people , Singen often has a very special effect , says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour community of seniors organizations .
In older generations , the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explained .
Lenz often observes that the singing or listening of songs to older people awakens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
Through song lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia-torn people are suffering from long-standing events .
In the case of singing , a special performance is also required .
At the same time , focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that 's a great cognitive challenge .
Even older people who live alone are not only focusing on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition given by the singing in the choir , says Hackler .
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment .
Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir .
To show itself : If I 'm long for something to eat , I 'll be better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens .
There are enough reasons to start singing .
Who wants to try a new hobby should n't hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , advises Lenz .
You are not alone - at least 50 people - who are listening to them when they go out ?
Looking for the matching offer , seniors have different options , says Hackler .
If someone is out of the audience in a seniors choir , you can easily join .
Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
If you want to sing in a church choir , you can go straight to the village or church .
Many seniors can be found via the internet .
If you do not have access to the Internet , you can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the Internet .
If you want to sing , you should join a choir .
Singing does the soul well and has something liberalized - that applies to every age .

E-mail and internet in timeline : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communicator came to the market .
The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device wog up nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
It was thick and bigger , so it was not good enough .
On the contrary , it was quite patchy .
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes , which would be enough for roughly two selfires today .
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes .
The `` Nokia 9000 Communicator '' arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
For a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they are somehow out of the start of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the Communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as a `` office in the Western Enthusiasm . ''
In fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive SMS and e-mails , even by fax .
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit slowly .
A calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen .
It was quite proud of the price : 2700 D-Mark , about 1400 euros .
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
No one could see in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the start of the smartphone era .
Since then , everything has changed .
The smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
The Finns ' cell phone sparse experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and managed .
The market is dominating today , all of which came a lot later than Nokia .
Always online , that is today for a lot of people .
In 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
Some 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple account for 555 million .
The worldwide turnover of the equipment is around EUR 400 billion .
This includes the well-running shops of the countless app-provider and telecommunications companies .
Around the smartphone is now a whole industry .
The decisive breakthrough in the mass market came only in early 2007 , at that time , Apple 's chief executive Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones on the Mac World .
He promised three devices in one : A music player , a phone and an internet communicator , all by touch screen easy to use .
Apple 's victory , yet today the iPhone is the main product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , who dominated the market , had the afterthought .
She eventually disappeared , Blackberry got to fight .
The seed now has Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
Today , on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
`` We must all learn to get the smartphone away , '' said Janina Kugel , in the Siemens Executive Board for Personal Information .
Permanent accessibility is now considered as a curse and a blessing .

Condoms with chilipuder , fireworks promote Tanzanian elephant protection
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into populated settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with Chiilipuder .
The method has proved to be effective , and the Honeyguide Foundation , which had already had the idea of the idea years ago , has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without infringing animals .
Previously , many spears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Heritage Day dedicated to animal welfare .
`` Since we have developed this ... toolkit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident they can stop elephants from their fields without harming the elephants , '' the chief executive of Honeyguard Damian Bell said in a communication .
The first two steps include the elephant 's lighting with a torch and the blaze in a horn .
If he is not deterred , a so-called `` Chiliwolke . ''
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks into a condom , which is now being overturned to the spark .
When it is hooked , the condom burst with a bang and spray fine dust at Chilipuder in the air .
A smoke is usually already out of place to hunt elephants .
One last option is a driver who shoots a gold smoke plant in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

Gilead receives legal expenses from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal expenses arising from the hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc .
In June , Gilead was freed from a compensation payment amounting to $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Merck , which was related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni by Gilead , after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of wrongdoing on the part of Mercks , including the Meineides and other unethical acts .
When collecting the lawsuit on Thursday , U.S. President Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to charge the cost that emerged during the case of the case .
Merck tries to equalise with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of Hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
The case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck signed up to each other and property on laboratory work , which was based on Sopsbuvir 's underlying content , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .

Woman overrides on Swiss highway
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was overturned on a highway in the early hours of Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
The incident happened on the A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight .
A woman placed himself in the dark `` in an act of desperation '' on the street and was hit by several cars , police said in Vaud .
It is obvious that a silence in the age of 49 , which was overturned by several vehicles , including a load car , wanted to kill himself .
She still died on the ground .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said police urging them and any witnesses of the incident to report .
It has opened an investigation procedure , which is a `` logical '' step in such a situation , shared Gilles Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
Was a clash avoidable ?
That 's something the prosecutor has to decide , `` Hofstetter said .
Two similar cases over the past five years show drivers will not be held responsible .
In each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists should not assume that a pedestrian was on the motorway in the middle of the night , as the newspaper said .
Last year , a policeman was acquitted of the negligent killing after driving a man and killed , who was in August 2014 a night on the A1 near Payerne .
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has been left unconscious on the street .
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to a emergency call -- drove on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a `` perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation , '' the judge said .
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report to police under the case number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .

This is the highest ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
The annual average inflation of the past 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CPI -0.8 % .
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 % , i.e . monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
Inflation since the start of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -0.2 % .
In July 2016 , a price rise of the following categories of consumer goods was observed in July 2016 : Food and non-alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; recreation and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
Prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
Prices remained like in the pre-month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; housing , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education the same .

Greenland shark : The oldest cyclist is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks mostly come to the surface in winter .
This shark was allowed back to the sea following an investigation aboard the Sanna research vessel .
He was born in 1624 and was floating a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland sharks only get back to 150 years .
In the middle of the North Atlantic , in an hour , it is only 1,220 meters long .
Only when it comes to speed , the five-metre-long animal speeds up to satch 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal .
However , this style of longevity seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal `` Science '' in any case by a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old .
`` Madness , '' commented Alexander Schemmelein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , which means a world record for vertebrate animals .
While the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland sharks become stealing .
Only the evidence failed .
Greenland sharks are hard to observe , after all , they live in the icesea above the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks .
Her pace of timing , when they announced six animals with a station before Spitsbergen-altitude peaks .
Prey to this sharks nonetheless : In the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had adorned the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the grounds of the icemether and seek cadavers , which are down from higher water threats downwards .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as a lead from the depths of the North Atlantic .
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long , while the biggest 502 centimetre was measured .
To identify the age of the animals , they analyzed the life of sharks with the carbon 14 method .
This center of the eye line already emerges before the birth of the sharks , the proteins contained therein are not renewed later .
The two smallest sharks had fallen down a lot of carbon-14 in the lens .
Her birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons were experimenting with larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
In the third-smallest animal of 220 centimetres in length , the Linsect , on the other hand , included a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons trials , which is expected to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2012 .
All the larger Greenland sharks , by contrast , had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lens , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
In fact , the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark an age of 335 , while the record shark with 502 centimetres was likely to be 392 years old .
That Greenland shark whites only get offspring when they are longer than four metres was known .
Now researchers were able to assign an age .
As one of the animals with 392 centimetres is arguably on the threshold of gender maturity , and its age was determined by 156 years , it is obvious that Greenland sharks , with the multiplication , are leaving at least one and a half centuries .
This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates .
That such meteoraleme is mostly living in icy waters is no accident .
Even the previous record holder , a 211-year-old Greenland whale , in whose bacon at Nocks a 120-year-old Harpunt tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
Due to the low temperatures , the animal 's body often runs on a flat .
So they mature later - and ageing slower .
In order to stay warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal loses heat .
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant .
Another advantage : They have fewer enemies .
`` A smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible , '' explains the evolutionary biologist .
A very large animal should instead invest its resources in a long life .

Funeral at Bargteheide - man shoots on life hazard
A 35-year-old man shot dead at his partner in a multi-family home in Bargteheide Stormarn on Friday at 10.45 p.m .
`` The man has called himself with us and indicated to have shot his life threat , '' said a police spokeswoman .
The offense is on the escape , according to him .
In the meantime , Sven S. could be on the road .

Queensferry Crossing : Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35-billion-expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the North deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the Viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife .
It is the first of four decrees of the `` cover zone , '' which approaches the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
Fife 's bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete , as well as 46 wires .
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Business Minister Keith Brown issued a visit today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
He said : `` This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings .
We are all witnesses to engineering from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passage .
Overall , almost 79 % of the entire bridal deck is at their place and the last section of the deck is now getting a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth , which means the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : `` The first conclusion is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
In this fantastic project , the conclusion represents a pioneering high-end construction .
After the installation of the last road cover and its connection with the northern turmdeck , we had to close the existing gap on the North or Landside .
This was achieved by dragging the northern Zubragerbrücke bridge 700 millimeters south .
This was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate activity .
Massive , as the viaduct is 222 meters long , it weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards of about 3 % .
Delicate , as the tolerances to which the team is working , they were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres .
Thankfully , everything went very well .

In the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are being broken down .
Following the recent attacks , the Minister for the Interior , Mr de Maizière , now faces a thick safety package .
But what is a tolerance status with terror ?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Veröhner .
All his proposals are `` politically reasonable , '' the Federal Minister for the Interior says in the presentation of his new security package .
They do n't overdemand anyone .
Others , further points would be discussed at first within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
However , as a Home Secretary , it is in favour of results and an `` achievable consensus '' within the Coalition .
De Maizière has left a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting its conclusions on security in the Republic .
That is all the more important .
A lot has already been announced , heralded by the fact that a new security agency is to take care of using encrypted communications .
Nor does Germany have to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons legislation .
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising .
In part , de Maizière is launching a second round of proposals for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : He wants to criminalise recruitment for terrorist groups and , with dual citizenship , would push the German passport .
`` That will be difficult points for the SPD , '' admits the CDU man .
However , he believes this is reasonable and I call for nothing to do with the coalition partner anyway .
A few new ideas are presented by de Maizière .
These have been partly in itself : It plans to make rapid deportation and more opportunities to arrest people before deportation .
Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security review .
In cases of rejection for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to put aside some even worse than to date - such as committing crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers to conceal their identity .
Some of this is politically and legally delicate .
Manches also seem to be invisible and leaves questions open .
And on some points - in the case of unequal treatment for example - the question arises : What has it actually done with security and terrorism ?
Yes , it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror .
But we can not deny that the perpetrators of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees .
In addition , many people were concerned about security , given the high number of refugees .
And things that are deeply employed by the people have not yet been left out for election campaigns .
Internal security has been enormous .
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
Uncertainty is great .
And yes , there are election battles .
The Union and the SPD have therefore become increasingly active in the field of internal security .
Over the past few days , the two parties have been high .
Only a garsting dispute over the equipping of federal police , then over a security-policy-thinking collection of some Unions Home Secretary , in which the portfolio chiefs are also calling for a Burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship .
De Maizière is also here to make sense .
There is nothing to do with the disappearance of the double .
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
To remake it is not meaningful .
And on a burka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
Whether his own package is constitutional and whether it is actually `` reasonable '' for the coalition partner , it is still necessary .
There are some things that could cause dispute .
But the SPD is also trying to take advantage of internal security .
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals his willingness to talk openly and says : `` The SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to further increase security . ''

The `` Identity Movement '' is in the name of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
According to a number of national offices , the German Federal Government 's constitutional protections have also been monitored .
`` We see the '' Identity Movement `` clues to efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , '' said Constitutional Secretary Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
In this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are subjected to extreme violence .
That is why we are watching the movement .
The `` Identity Movement '' is a group with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
It turns out against `` Multikulti-Wahn , '' `` unchecked mass immigration '' and `` losing its own identity by alienation . ''
The `` identitarian '' are already observed in nine German Länder - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden-Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia .
Maassen said his authority had agreed closely with the national offices .
`` Groups like the 'Identity Movement ' try to pick up their target group as it stands , '' the Constitutional Secretary said .
In general , extremists are trying to address them with youth , often with poptic music .
Those were Islamists , as well as right-wing extremists .
This is not a real advertisement for its own .
Propaganda is supposed to raise people emotionally .
Young people are particularly vulnerable .
That is dangerous .
Most recently , there have been reports from a number of federal states about the `` identitarian '' to AfD politicians .
Maassen said he had no knowledge of that .
For constitutional protection , such contacts are only relevant from a point of view .
It is a question of whether or not the party - in this case the AfD - changed its direction and becomes so extremist by certain people who are extremist .
So the decisive factor is whether such people have to have a keen influence on the party .
That is not apparent .
With a view to the significant increase in legally-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters , Maassen said he would not yet talk about new rights of terrorism .
However , over the past few years , we have established that there can be legislative structures .
There was the Group 's Old School Society or the Freemer Group .
It may well be that other terrorist groups or micro-groups can form themselves , who are planning attacks against asylum seekers , against refugees or attacks from other right-wing motives .
A German-wide or Europe-wide management of legal terrorism is not apparent .
The previous groups have emerged at regional or social networks .
Concerns expressed concern that many attacks went to people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
That is the cause of concern .
Many of the suspects on asylum-shelter attacks have not been known before as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene .
`` Many people have committed crimes that had previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists , who were perhaps politically indifferent or who , for example , have chosen CDU , the SPD or the Left , who , however , have become radicalized by extremist voting . ''

The charges per cubic metre of waste water from October 1 , 2016 for the area of waste water treatment Neudorf / Reth / Welchenkahl .
At the airport in Azendorf , the waste water charge will increase once more , if appropriate .
After an oversleeved calculation , the waste water price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 Euro per cubic meter .
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser ( CSU ) reported , the Council 's approval of the budget was determined by the Kulmbach County Council that undercover covers for these waste water plants .
The Kasendorf market is subject to legal basis for a cost-free operation .
As of 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Welchschahl , Neudorf , Reth , Azendorf , Lupp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse .
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
As administrative leader Herbert Schmidt revealed to the Body , a recalculation of the charges for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary .
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , even overcover or undercover from the previous period of calculations should be compensated .
The serious redundancies made by Schmidt to ensure that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water treatment in all three wastewater treatment plants between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
Thus , due to the small basis of distribution , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of thousands of euros would be serious .
In addition , waste water in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
Furthermore , in the declining period of time , all three installations have not been affected by a significant extent , not least due to their age of rehabilitation and repair .
The plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old , the plants for Welchschahl , Neudorf and Reth and Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lupp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a damage .
In the Pumpwerk Welschchenkahl , for nearly 20 years , the production facilities had to be overtaken by reason , and at the Lupp forest clearing house , after nearly 20 years of operation , the first treatment pond had to be spread , the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be used to keep the water legal requirements in place .
Schmidt : `` On these extraordinary expenses , the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs came to be taken into account in the new calculation period . ''
The same is true of electricity costs , which were clearly below the current level in 2011 / 2012 .
Stone houses made clear that in the small waste water case in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were `` fully reflected . ''
Said Schmidt , the market community of large-scale entertainment in the waste water sector over the past 20 years .
The situation for these plants will continue to remain fragile in the view of stonehouses , especially given that it is not possible to expand the area of the Friesenbachtal treatment area for these plants , because they are deficient .

B27 remediation : Restaurants suffer as a result
At the speed with which the B will be cleaned , there is nothing to get around .
For those who are responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.30am , and ending up until 20 p.m. , there will be full praise .
`` Those have made everything quite zakenig , '' says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet-gas station .
That 's a superteam .
There is no delay .
The building site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October .
It will also be commended for those who are responsible for the construction of the works , for example when it comes to the establishment of passenger tickets .
Since the construction site on Monday to the south and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen , and therefore the connection to Rottenburg again , the traffic situation in the village has been relaxed .
Citizens will now be able to move from Ofterdingen to the east .
The doorway through the place seems to go back .
`` There are some significant complaints , '' says the deputy chief executive director of Florian King , responsible for transport technology management .
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße , Steinlachstraße , Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise , because a lot of dirt trails were sought after , and were more familiar with their navi than the relief .
What led to the fact that a number of lorries in residential areas were franked .
As the speed limits have not been met , the congregation called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen .
`` There have been significant transgressions , '' says King , who made himself aware of the situation .
Two to three per minute were used .
The quick-hitting was travelling with 77 stunts in the pace-30 zone .
Since the building was further moved , it has become more peaceful .
For businessmen on the B 27 , it is only a small trost that the street is open again for customers from Rottenburg .
People do n't like to look into the cards .
But the fact that the B-27 has led them to take up sales has led everyone to look through .
However , some more and some are less affected .
Those who have less to do with the `` end-user '' are produced for other companies , for which the recovery has little effect .
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a `` not easy decrease , '' but also admits that `` the maturity is obviously missing . ''
At the heart of the road there is a bus stop .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the Steakhouse , formerly a crown , finds clear words .
That is already existential .
Not only him , but all the restaurants have `` hit it hard . ''
Customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil failed .
We have to be happy about every euro sales .
The cost of revenue is higher than 50 % .
The road landing had `` dropped back two years . ''
Half of his staff must have dismissed him .
If I had a company with a 4,000 staff and half would have been released , the policy would have reacted differently .
Instead , President Jörg Schmidt , on a request from Mr Göner , whether there could be financial compensation , with the indication that the host site benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the 27th of the year , it also needs to bear the disadvantages caused by the rehabilitation .
Göhner knows from other lands where so much more generous was handled .
With all the lawsuits , Göhner is sure his host will continue .
Finally , the family business has been here since 1715 , referring to the long history .
It is possible to understand that other regular guests are not looking at this time because of the complicated traffic management .
If you can not drive , it 's also nice .
Göhner has no doubts about the fact that he has returned to work after the end of the renovation work .
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza , Göner considers the impact of the B 27 building on its rally for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its longstanding history .
There are six months ' work , which is already brutal .

De Maizière said following the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July , many people were concerned about further attacks .
The state must also respond to terrorist threats .
Surely : Our country will not answer the perpetrators ' violence with hate and division .
We will not treat the terrorists to this triumph .
If criminals were to leave the country more quickly , however , they would also increase the security and strength of the population for refugee policy .
De Maizière aims to implement the proposals by 2017 .
He also announced a further human-security reinforcement of the security forces , `` in mid-quarters over several years . ''
The role of sympathies for terrorism must be punished again .
Video surveillance is to be improved , the arms right is so novel , that it is particularly difficult to buy weapons on the Internet .
The most recently-discussed secrecy for doctors is to be maintained after de Maizière .
However , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the vulnerability of the citizens , `` he said , with a view to seeing mental difficulties .
To counter the radicalisation of refugees , the Minister considers better social care .
Teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumatic experiences .
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Darknet ) , de Maizière plans to use covert investigators .
SPD boss Gabriel said : `` The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . ''
It is important that the Home Secretary clearly expressed its opposition to actionism .
`` That was an earrings for the hinges in the CDU / CSU , '' Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group ( Friday ) .
De Maizière had previously denied Rufe from the Union following a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
A general ban on full concealment is problematic for constitutional reasons .
You can not ban everything you reject and I reject the bear of the Burka .
You can talk about rules about road transport or for witnesses .
Greens chief in Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate action with ever-new anti-terror packages .
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said : `` Fleet spray and a tightening of the right to stay will not bring people in that country more security . ''

Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired , but some observers say that it is insensitive to breeds .
With its filtering tool , Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are blunt , feature twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day .
All missteps reach the public .
Snapchat filters have in the past been criticized in which they were accused that the app would promote blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal .
When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes , false teeth and bloated cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians- '' yellow face '' .
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from the Verge and motherboard , one day after Snapchat informed that it would have disabled the feature .
The company offered an apology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians .
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of infringing clichés .
Others rejected the anime comparison decidedly .
In an email , Grace Sparapani wrote , a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos that the filter was `` offensive and mildly uncomfortable . ''
She added that `` it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not gelbgesichtig , but that the yellow face was dragged into the devaluation extremity .
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wires .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands .
And Snapchats large audiences of young people-who are more diverse than their older counterparts in terms of race-could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , `` it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was previously the case , '' said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same .
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the large part of white , only male leadership , and finished her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
`` Either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , '' said the Chinese-American Zhu , `` or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . ''
Others share their opinion , a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered .
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a personnel manager who focuses on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Zhu said that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added , `` I wonder if you need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK . ''

Escape : `` Every woman who has fled has experience of sexual violence ''
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost to everyday life .
When you arrive in Germany , you are often traumatized .
A house offers refuge .
In a large kitchen sit four women .
Each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
One has put her little son in the arm .
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes .
His mother stares at the table top .
Until she notices she 's being watched .
She smiles briefly and kisses the little girl .
The scene looks normal .
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr .
She is an area managing director of Condrobs , a supporter of social services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
The four women in the kitchen have fled .
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized shelters for single-fled women and their children in Bavaria .
In January , Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women 's assistance .
Recently it was officially opened .
Sixty people live there-about 40 women and 20 children .
There are no men-even as visitors .
The exception is a security guard outside the door .
`` It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight , '' says Bahr .
`` Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatened with torture or death , or because their families send them as hopefuls to Europe , '' she says .
In women , there are other reasons for escape : `` Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out . ''
In their homeland , they have experience of sexual violence , forced marriages , honor killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
This is driving them away .
On the run this goes on .
`` For example , for a bottle of water , tugs demand a sexual act is not a rarity , '' says Bahr .
And the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
Who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , is mistaken , says Bahr .
Here too , single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst abused .
This leads to the fact that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized , she appreciates .
`` Some of the children have certainly not voluntarily emerged '' .
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
`` Or they do not dare to speak openly about what has been experienced , because the shame is too great '' .
Since they often do not know how to help , they need more accommodation just for them , asks Bahr .
In Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees .
The question of whether you know of a similar project as in Munich in your area of competence answers some with No .
In the Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia , for example , there is no such thing in government housing .
Even in Swabia , women who have fled alone are not accommodated separately , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , government spokesman .
In Upper Bavaria , under-and Middle Franconia there are in some common accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
The exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and gender equality in the European Parliament also calls for men to be accommodated separately .
In a study published for the Committee , it says : `` It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately . ''
`` If the privacy is lacking or if men and women are accommodated together , there may be continual violence against women . ''
Especially the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen in the crowds that exist on the house in Munich .
`` Since we 've been around , we have a long waiting list , '' says Bahr .
You could easily open a second house .

Airline is not liable : crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger in the passenger bridge .
Because a liability is only possible for dangers that are typical for air transport , the higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( AZ . : 18 u 124/14 ) argued .
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap at the fall .
However , the accident could have happened everywhere-it was a general risk of life , the court said .
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages .

Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a joint statement its denunciation .
Gibson , who played the special agent Aaron Hotchner , apologized on Thursday before announcing his denunciation publicly .
On the set , there was an artistic difference and a disagreement .
I regret the incident , `` he said in a message .
Details on how Gibson 's character from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , will be published , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television studios , are expected to be released at a later date .
The 54-year-old , who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg , has been with him since the first season of the series in 2005 .
`` I love criminal Minds and have put my whole heart into the last twelve years , '' said Gibson in a communication published on Friday .
I was hoping to be there until the end , but that wo n't be possible now .
I would simply like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
The planned airing of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th .

Bomb terror in Thailand-Austrian injured-several deaths
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schnöll , Friday morning .
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but had already been able to leave .
Her journey home was planned for the beginning of September .
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens , is still unclear for the time being .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , says Schnöll .
The Hua Hin , located approximately 200 km south of Bangkok 's capital , was first exploded on Thursday evening in an nightlife quarter .
According to the police , a Thai was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
On Friday morning , two explosives were raised again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
At the detonation near the beach Patong , popular with holidaymakers , a taxi driver was injured according to police information .
In Surat Thani , on the southeast coast of the country , another bomb exploded , killing an urban employee .
According to the authorities , the explosives were blown up in a flower bed in front of the coastal police station .
Finally , detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injured .
You go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin , it was said .
`` The bomb attacks bear the same handwriting , '' said Army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning to journalists .
`` We assume that this is a coordinated attack . ''
It is too early to comment on possible motives , but it is probably the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
The Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism .
`` This is only local sabotage , which is limited to limited areas and provinces , '' said a spokesman in Bangkok .
Rather , it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta .
In recent days , the authorities would have received intelligence on impending attacks in the south of the country-but they were not informed about the exact time and places .
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
In Thailand there are always smaller bombings , but they are usually not directed against tourists .
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
After the present bomb explosions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities must be guaranteed .
High security risk ( Security Level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and environs .
After clashes between the security forces and Muslim populations , it is not advisable to travel to these provinces .
Increased security risk ( Security Level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta .
This also gives the military great influence in the years to come .
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha said the bombs were an attempt to wreak havoc , while the country was moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
The Militärunta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , is self-sufficient to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order .
However , the military has not managed to get hold of the rebellion of Muslim rebels , which has been simmering in the extreme south of the country for many years .
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
Just under a year ago in Bangkok , 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine-most of them foreign tourists .
It was the bloodiest attack of the country 's recent history .

`` To give an example : if I ask him something that is two years back when I sang at the Scala in Milan , he remembers nothing , '' said Netrebko .
But he is the happiest man on Earth .
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with the bass baritone Erwin Scrap .
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov .

Berlin/Schwerin : poll before country elections : SPD and CDU lose
In the forthcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties are looming .
This resulted in representative surveys of the research Institut INSA for the `` Bild '' newspaper ( Friday ) .
While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
In both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to be the head of government .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
According to the survey , the party would be just barely in front of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD .
The left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.4 percent ) , the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag .
Despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , the green would returned to the Schwerin Landtag .
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each .
According to the poll , the SPD of the Berlin House of Deputies would only be 23 percent ( election 2011:28.3 percent ) .
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent .
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011:17.6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.7 percent ) .
The AfD would be represented in the House of Deputies for the first time at 14 percent .
With 5 percent , the FDP could hope for a return , but the Pirates would miss the entry in 2011 .

Pokémon go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It 's fascinating to watch the world change .
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play , rather prefer to spend their free time on screens , was lamented by many in the last decade .
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and making them more active .
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and most recently to smartphones .
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer , of course , to the Pokémon go craze , an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a series of cartoons , playing cards and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined somewhat in early July .
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overwhelmed the servers .
Within a few days , Pokémon had go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and , once they are found , can be `` photographed '' ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or `` captured '' .
A generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the craze and jumped for the search from the sofa .
In the United States , the game led to a significant increase in steps that the `` average '' person returns every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch tracking 35,000 users , recently shared the Washington Post that within two days of the game 's launch , the number of tracked people exercising every day 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
The company does n't know who 's playing Pokémon go-it only sees the raw data to improve performance .
Many public awareness campaigns on health that make people want to `` take 30 minutes to come '' from the sofa and `` to be active every day '' came across deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable .
However , the importance of sport can not be overrated .
Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression .
Physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead you here .
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy .
Thus , three pillars of health are covered-movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people even make new friends on the hunt .
As always , there are also grumpy spoilers who always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could run against a door .
What 's the matter ?
A breakthrough has occurred .
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does .
The new will lose its allure and the use will diminish over time .
Due to Pokemon 's success , however , there will be more games that will connect apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

The Volkswagen lightly is still coming through .
Despite diesel scandals , the delivery figures are rising worldwide .
But not all markets are running around .
The recall action has a swirl around a term .
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year in the deliveries .
Despite the diesel affair , Europe 's largest carmaker can continue to present a positive trend in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets .
However , in July Brody the VW brand was mainly in Western Europe and again burdened the total sales , as the company quoted in the Dax .
Worldwide , the VW brand sold 449100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July than in the same month of the previous year .
In Western Europe alone , the second most important market after China , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
In the domestic market of Germany , the deliveries slumped by almost one-sixth .
Brand Sales manager Jürgen Stackmann introduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
In addition , there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets by changing economic conditions .
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU also had a negative impact , explained a spokeswoman .
In the US , where the exhaust affair first escalated , there is also a minus to be booked .
Great support for VW is the Chinese market .
Overall , the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony is still lightly by the diesel scandal : After the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be booked .
Group Sales manager Fred Kappler continued to have a sales plus from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had been manipulating a software exhaust test .
In Germany alone , VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be retrofitted to the workshops .
In the course of the changeover , VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects .
After retrofitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
After retrofitting , the car manufacturer shall issue a `` guarantee-like '' certificate to the customer , but do not speak of a `` guarantee '' as it was called on Friday in company circles .
The reason is legal subtleties .
The `` Focus '' had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models .
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representative at the Federal Ministry of Transport .
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
`` VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigative commission and KBA . ''
`` Deviations from this will not be accepted , '' declared federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration will take place in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion and that all vehicle values of type approval are unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term `` guarantee '' , however , as it was called in business circles .
In the broad term `` guarantee '' , Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , will be able to come to a workshop with a motor damage half a year after retrofitting-and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
It is also important in the customer 's interest to avoid the fact that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal , comes to uncertainty about possible warranty regulations , as was said .
That is why VW does not use the term `` guarantee '' .

Destination plates : Who actually buys vinyl records ?
Lonely men of Middle Ages love plates .
Before you rush to the commentary to sow it under the pseudonym NichtAlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters with harsh insults , this statement derives from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-discussed Wiederaufstehung of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials , which wants to welcome the news of physical objects , but rather to the mid-life nostalgia .
Those who recently bought a record are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54 .
In fact , the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors-it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But do the results of YouGov agree ?
If this blog were a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I was walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho , wearing a modest grey suit and gestuliereing wildly before I stood , holding my hands and saying something decisive like , `` So , let 's take a closer look at it . ''
So , let 's take a look at it .
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly filling up with its charm losing hotels , restaurants and offices now the buildings in which once independent sellers were established-there is still a handful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I from sister Ray ( data count : Two young women , three middle-aged men ) to Reckles Records ( data number : Eight middle-aged men , a woman , presumably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
`` I guess so , '' he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
These records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
`` Many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . Things I was probably a little too young to buy , `` he says .
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and happy to spend time alone , adding : `` I do n't smoke and I do n't drink very much .
That 's my truck .
GMT , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers he meets will apply to the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the MEDIENHPE , people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records .
Of the conversations I led , people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , `` he says .
This would explain the boom of followers of the record revival of a certain age .
But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops provide a soothing community of minded people .
According to GMT , some of the older customers took offense to the contactless payment system .
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects that evoke happy youth memories .
`` I think sometimes it may be filling a void or owning material possessions as a kind of consolation , '' says GMT .
It 's like a collector and I think it 's like that for a lot of people .
It 's an easy way to deal mentally .
`` We are like your social workers ! '' an employee flutes from a stack of plates .
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
The survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have a turntable .
At this point in the news report , I would probably look very anxious as I leaf through a pile of bossa nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the universe ( data number : Three middle-aged men ) , has noticed a `` trophy aspect '' of the revival .
`` Someone just came in here recently and said , '' I do n't own a record player , but I 'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf , `` he says .
This is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
More produktlastig , less musiklastig .
We have people who say , `` I do n't have a turntable . ''
These are younger people , not elders , who come in slowly .
Fopp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a more colourful audience than I go .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists who take photos , Teenagejungs and middle-aged women .
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops-Wild Beast 's newest synthesizer and sexbepackter pop instead of experimental jazz roars out of the loudspeakers-it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
None of them looks very lonely , but nagging mental trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of plates for sale .
It 's more of a window shopping than a big shopping .
She does n't deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... `` She drives with a loving sigh .
I do n't know how to explain it-it 's really unique .
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : Urban Outfitters .
While I seem to be patterning the jeans hot pants , I 'm watching a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley turntable .
To the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates by Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : A mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
No one looks at them-perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
It is pure `` record art '' .
But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send into the deep sohos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one who spends most on luxury items such as slabs .
Even though my research has shown that the results of YouGov are correct , they , at least in record stores in Soho , do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through the record shops of Berwick Street and leafing through slabs , while avoiding the glaring gaze of an uncanny , 30-year-old false moderator who rises above the shoulders of middle-aged men .

Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany 's speeders have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers : in various federal states , among others in Hesse and Brandenburg , new flash units are being tested , which are intended to make the speed sinners particularly effective .
The futuristic enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
For example , on motorway construction sites or on refurbished bridges with a temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary flasher for adherence to the speed limit .
However , permanent mobile construction can be dangerous or costly .
The enforcement trailer is self-sufficient : its battery lasts five days with continuous measuring operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
With laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across several tracks simultaneously .
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
In the raised state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with any car with trailer hitch .
So that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the armored and by the way also bulletproof outer shell .
In addition , a built-in alarm system should protect the flasher from vandalism .
Since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by vitronic in various federal states and has now also been used .
Also foreign authorities flash with the new technology : Recently , France has ordered 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year .

Greenland : The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter .
This shark was allowed to return to sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna .
He was born 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic until today .
Greenland sharks only get offspring with 150 years .
The Greenland swims slowly along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters wide .
Only when it counts , the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h-and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed .
This lifestyle , which is characterized by slowness , seems to be a panacea for a high age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal `` Science '' in any case from a Greenland that could be 392 years old .
`` Madness '' , commented Alexander Scheuer from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock This life span , which means a world record for vertebrate animals .
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are old .
Only the evidence was missing .
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks .
They measured their slow-motion tempo as they were equipping six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen .
Prey still make these sharks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , and another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear .
They may be chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean , looking for carcasses staggering from higher levels of water .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now examining 28 Greenland sharks , which caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 .
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long , while the largest 502 centimeters in size .
To determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the Sharks with the carbon 14 method .
This center of the eye lens arises even before the birth of the sharks , the proteins contained therein are later no longer renewed .
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core .
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempts hurled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
In the 220 cm length third smallest animal , the lens core , however , contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons trying , so it should have celebrated its 50th anniversary in its investigation in 2012 .
In contrast , all the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core , which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
In fact , the carbon 14 clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland showed an age of 335 years , while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old .
The fact that Greenland females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known .
Now the researchers could assign the length to an age .
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland sharks with the multiplication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries .
This is also likely to be the world record for vertebrate animals .
The fact that such Methusaleme mainly live in icy waters is no coincidence .
The previous record holder , a 211 year old whale , in whose bacon on the nape of a 120 year old harpoon tip , was also trapped in front of Alaska .
Due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a saving flame .
So they ripen later and age slower .
In order to keep themselves warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal heat losing .
The heat loss of a Gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant .
Another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
`` A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible in the early days , '' explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuer .
A very large animal should instead invest its resources in a long life .

Steal : So perfidious blackmailing hackers their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies-and are doing so successfully .
According to a recent survey of malware-defense specialists Malware bytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of companies surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with Blackmailer software .
In Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for ransomware blackmail .
40 percent of the victims readily paid the ransoms required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of malware bytes on attacks in corporate networks .
If they are successful there , the potentially blackmailing ransom will be significantly higher than for private users .
`` We are currently witnessing a terrifying rapid evolution of malware , '' explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski talking to the `` world '' .
In 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements .
Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves .
Only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months frighteningly fast .
Ransomware works on a simple pattern : once active on a victim 's computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals .
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers .
To get the Endschlüsselungs code to the files , the victims have to transfer money-usually in the form of Cryptowährung bitcoin .
However , where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , companies are sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stands still .
Accordingly , the damage is higher if a ransomware strikes .
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by ransomware , 13 percent even had to interrupt the business altogether , in one case people were in danger of life .
In Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records .
`` We always tell the victims : Do n't pay , you only promote the problem , '' explains Kleczynski .
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
It is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in the company .
The hackers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , F-Secure 's security researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and came to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin , set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt free sample files .
And if private individuals are redeemed for a few hundred euros , companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted .
With potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from ransomware blackmail , hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work , explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus vendor Sophos : `` A single person can write a ransomware circa within a week . ''
It is more probable , however , that these are three or four persons .
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers .
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a one-time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
`` Included is a customization tool so that smaller configurations , appearance , and branding can be changed , '' says Wisniewski .
The blackmailers then seek out other hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
So one logs into one of the forums underground , buys the set from a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
Payment is made per infected computer .
`` The criminals usually commission spammers with the spread , '' explains Wisniewski .
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies who are better at securing their data .
More than 50 percent of corporate IT executives in the malware bytes survey rely on the ability to defend ransomware with file back-ups and scanner software .
Accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
`` If encrypting data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful Erpessung , the perpetrators will instead threaten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , '' explains malware byte boss Marcin Kleczynski .
This means that the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
In future , the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things .
At the hacker conference DEFCON , security researchers demonstrated how to get control of a thermostat connected to the Internet .
In the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom for many victims .
If , instead of heating , the perpetrators block an entire production line in a factory in the future , ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0 .

Who is building Brunswick 's cheap apartments ?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be much more involved in the future .
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
The SPD is proposing a `` living concept of action '' at the next Council meeting .
But strife is programmed .
First and foremost , the question is : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
A regulation is missing so far .
SPD Bundestag Group chairman Christoph Bratmann says : `` We are in agreement with the Greens : if you want to build urban areas , you have to have 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . ''
However , the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock .
The big point of controversy in the city hall , however , is Bratmann : `` How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? ''
`` We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such land , but as much as 20 percent of the flats as social housing . ''
A new urban housing Support programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives .
The problem , according to Bratmann : `` There is currently no agreement between the political groups . ''
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors .
The left wants still hardships for investors .
Despite this , according to Bratmann , there is a worsening of the situation in the housing market .
If the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the management of the administration .
More staff is needed .
It is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
But the programme is still not complete : the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
But how does one balance the loss of another approximately 1300 cheap flats , the funding of which will expire in the next few years ?
By 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
To prevent this , according to the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be buying expiring ties from the city .
It would also have to be thought about bringing apartments back into the price fixing .
This is possible in the West .
In one shot , the problem could be solved .
In the west , deadlines expire at the end of the year .
Around 1800 apartments could be put back in the price fixing for cheap apartments .
Only : The owners , the housing companies do not want that .
Because the number of social housing in the West is again drastically increased , one removes itself from the goal of the so-called mixing .
There will no longer be a concentration of socially weak in only a few parts of the city .
The Greens reckon that there will still be movement in the discussion .
Bundestag Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says : `` For a broad majority , the CDU must be in the boat . ''
It has concentrated on more sites for single-family homes .
But this does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .

Nordeseeölarbeiter take up talks again , put strike out
The labour disputes regarding remuneration for oil workers are being suspended , while all parties to the conflict are at the table for a new round of talks , said negotiators .
Strikes against the oil field Service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
`` Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to relaunch the settlement process of the current dispute , '' it says in a common statement .
We will be holding a few full-day sessions in the next few weeks that will start early next year to tackle the problems anew .
The unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group has cut the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure .
The company 's rate reduction follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014 .
The company said that additional cutbacks give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn .
Shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business activities as a result of its Megazusammenschlusses with the British energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has intensified as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union in June .
The Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with workers ' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea since a generation .
The North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
`` In the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , '' he said in a statement .
In 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in expenditure on new projects in the North Sea is expected to average around $ 7 billion in the last five years .

Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had been founded ISIS was `` sarcasm ''
On Friday , Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the `` founders '' of the terrorist group of the Islamic State was not meant to be serious .
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate on whether he was able to communicate clearly and with the American public .
It also brings his comrades , who seek to protect him during an eventful phase , in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all .
After making the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Trump rowed back in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
But in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was just being sarcastic .
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accusation completely serious .
When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it .
The last storm of criticism patters down on Mr. Trump while he was trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again .
Reporting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense .
At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but later he explained , `` Of course I meant that sarcastically . ''
This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rowing back as needed .
`` I think it 's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then , if necessary , '' clarify `` depending on how the reaction fails . '' said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates .
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Trump has adopted an even more caustic tone , as his poll values have declined further .
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist , released on Friday , showed a leadership with great prominence in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida .
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks , he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor .
But while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him , regardless of how provocative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , former mayor of New York and one of Trump 's most prominent advocates , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday .
`` I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , '' said Mr. Giuliani , so he was questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump 's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
It is true in this sense that before Obama was ISIS an almost unknown , small organization , he called it backbench , completely wrong and that 's why it happened because he pulled the troops from Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state , allowed ISIS to spread out by leaving the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control .
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media , accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him .
He mocked the `` poor , pathetic '' television pundits who try to understand him and said , `` You ca n't do it ! `` .
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump 's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for president .

Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2 % federal tax
Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband , and an effective federal VAT rate of 34.2 % .
In 2015 , the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; Former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in speech fees ; The former foreign minister issued an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her term of office in the Foreign Ministry .
Clinton 's candidate for the vice presidency , Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia , has published his tax returns for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Holton .
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
`` Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , '' announced Clinton 's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion .
In stark contrast , Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retracts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his refusal a tax audit by the tax authorities .
`` You are on the train , '' wrote Clinton 's campaign helper Ian Sams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump 's special adviser , told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are not completed .
Trump 's critics , including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney , have already announce that his refusal raises issues relating to wealth , his donations to charities , his business and various other links , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already crashed on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet , in which highly Albanian Republicans Trump invite his tax return .
On Thursday , she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
`` He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . '' She said to the crowd .
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s , and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of Steueranwältenn and tax advisors on Friday , saying that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett who would make sure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama is also supporting the proposal .
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska , Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has his seat here , urged Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump did `` fear '' before the voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has published tax returns by the year 2007 .
The Clintons who now live in Chappaqua , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined rate of about 40.5 % .
The Clinton tax return of 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as a wage , unlike the bulk of all Americans .
Their main financial investment was a cost-effective index fund , from which the Clintons taxed dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 .

French court rejects offer about demolition of stores in the Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , where thousands of refugees live , barriers .
At a court hearing this week , the authorities in Calais argued that that the state should be empowered to dismantle 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the camp were , from cigarettes to energy , sell , offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants .
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would entail a fire and sanitation risk .
Humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse .
They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people carrying out the 72 provisional transactions , but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were `` absolutely comprehensible . ''
The judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feed people who `` live in extremely precarious conditions . ''
He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places threatened by low-tearing , was the camp 's Jungle Book Kids ' Café , which is run by Gemeinnnützig and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors in the warehouse .
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to uphold the kids ' café .
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure `` for these children would be a catastrophe of which the youngest are eight years old . ''
The two aid organizations help refugees and l'auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 men-the highest number to date-after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer .

Queensferry Crossing : Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the Norddeck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct-which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife .
It is the first of four closures of the `` deck blowers '' that approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes .
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Economics minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to cross the bridge from the country .
He said : `` This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings .
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
In total , almost 79 % of the total bridge decks are in their place and the final section of the deck today gets a betonguess for the deck in Rosyth , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : `` The first closure represents a significant milestone for every bridge project .
In this fantastic project , the shutter is a pioneering building and civil engineering .
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it to the North Tower deck in the expansion , we had to close the remaining gap on the north or the side of the site .
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south .
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
Massive , since the viaduct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upward at an incline of about 3 % .
Tricky , because the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny -- on each side they were only a few millimeters .
Luckily , everything went very well .

Killed in bomb attack : He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life to the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
He was the hero of Aleppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
He risked everything to save the lives of others .
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the White Helmets , a civil protection group that , according to Bild newspaper , saved almost 60,000 people 's lives .
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk in order to attract people from bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
They are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil Protector , which shows him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
As a hero , however , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : `` For me this is the real jihad . ''
`` When I die to save lives , I think that God sees a martyr in me . ''
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing in Syria .
The helicopters threw four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district , one was filled with chlorine .
A woman and two children died , seven people suffer from shortness of breath .
`` We are now eliminating the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it , '' the picture quotes his last words before he died .
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .

Swiss Post enters the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
The post plans to sell your electric vehicle StreetScooter also .
The group intends to start trading with the transporter shortly .
Swiss Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free market as of next year .
`` We want to go on sale to third parties , '' said a post-speaker on Friday .
The company has been examining for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter , with which letters and parcels are delivered , to other companies as well .
Post-board member Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always questions , such as craftsmen .
According to information from the news magazine `` The Spiegel '' , the Bonn group intends to enter into mass production of the vehicles shortly .
In post-production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly enlarge its fleet of electric cars and aim a complete changeover to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
`` We are going to make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , '' he said at the end of July .
I can imagine that we are readjusting the entire fleet .
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany 's roads since 2014 .

Frankfurt profits from the Brexit
The city on the main therefore has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies moving from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
`` It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote , '' says Michael Voigtlander , head of the financial markets and real estate markets of the IW .
After the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU .
For the so-called EU passport , you have been granted approval in the UK .
This is what large US banks are using .
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs .
The lobby association `` Frankfurt Main Finance '' expects 10000 new jobs on the main within five years .
For Frankfurt , according to the IW , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the largest banks in the eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance supervision Eiopa and the Risk council ESRB .
In Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
`` The proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervisor , '' says IW Professor Voigtlander .
Luxembourg has a large fund industry , but as well as Dublin , the infrastructure is worse off .
Thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
Further points the city with readily available commercial real estate .
`` In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices , '' says Voigtlander .
The Seine also rents for first-class commercial properties by 50 percent higher than the main .
In addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
In a ranking of business consultancy Mercer , the city ranked seventh , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin on Place 33 and Paris at 37 . Place .
Even though quality of life is a matter of preference : `` With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , '' concludes the IW .
But , despite the Brexit vote , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , the economists say .
This is also the situation of the forces : in London , in accordance with the figures of the Landesbank Helaba , around 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 62500 .

Salzburg `` West Side Story '' with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the `` West Side Story '' with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juliet .
With doing a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
A musical captured Salzburg : The `` West Side Story '' , Leornard Bern Stein 's masterpiece .
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
In the orchestra , the Simón Bolívar Orchestra is buried under the leadership of the Venezonalischen conductor Gustavo Dudamel : `` This music is full of rhythm , '' he raves .
We always say that it is very Latin American .
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
It is a wonderful blend , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
In this staging , Bartoli plays an older Maria .
She remembers with sadness at her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
The role of Mary has always fascinated me .
First , because it is exceptional musically !
And then there is Mary 's personality .
She says it in her song : `` I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and witty and bright '' .
So she 's smart , of course naïve , and very passionate .
`` She is very similar to my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman '' , Bartoli laughs .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It 's such an honor for us to work with her .
She is an immensely generous man .
And Bartoli returns the compliment : `` Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! ''
Conducting is a necessity for him .
You can see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
We both have a rather southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
For the American director Philip Wm . McKinley , the `` West Side Story '' is highly topical : `` This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism . ''
Today we have the refugees , at that time the Puerto have gone to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
They are the same subjects , and they are as meaningful today as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

And what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler .
All his proposals are `` politically reasonable '' to the coalition partner , says the federal minister at the presentation of his new security package .
They do n't overwhelm anyone .
Other , more advanced points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in this .
As Minister of the Interior , however , he was given results and a `` recoverable consensus '' within the coalition .
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach , de Maizière has had a little time to pass before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
But they are now all the more extensive .
Some is already known , announced , targeted : that a new security authority should look after the cracking of encrypted communication is not new .
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising .
In part , de Maizière launches a second start for proposals that were not to be made with the SPD so far : he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and jihadists the German passport with dual citizenship .
`` These will be difficult points for the SPD '' , admits the CDU man .
Nevertheless , he deems this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chances anyway .
A few new ideas presented de Maizière also .
They have it in part : He is planning quick procedures for deportation and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation .
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should first have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for a security review .
In tolerating rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than hitherto , such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to conceal their identity .
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive .
Some things are also baked and leaves questions open .
And on some points-in the unequal treatment of tolerated , for example-the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
Yes , says de Maizière , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
But it is not possible to deny that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees .
In addition , many people were concerned about security in the face of the high numbers of refugees .
And things that people profoundly employed were not even allowed to be excluded in election campaign times .
Internal security has been a huge focus .
First the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
The uncertainty is great .
And yes , there are election fights .
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly putting themselves on the subject of internal security .
In the past few days , the two parties were high .
It was only a nasty dispute over the equipping of the federal Police , then a collection of security policy ideas of some union interior ministers , in which the heads of the ministries also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship .
De Maizière strives is also here for conciliatory tones .
He has nothing to do with a departure from the double pass .
We have pacified the discussion in Germany .
It is not sensible to reopen it .
And in a burka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
Whether his own package at all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually `` reasonable '' for the coalition partner , has yet to show itself .
There are a lot of things that could cause controversy .
But the SPD is also trying to profile itself in the topic of internal security .
Party chief Sigmar Gabriel first of all tentatively signals willingness to talk and says : `` The SPD is ready to speak about everything , which helps to increase security further '' .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer to Rudersieg
There will be no emotinaleres gold than these games , and that will mean something .
From the first stroke to the last , 220 hard Hieve that go into history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa .
Even though there were only the two who were seated at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . The echo of coach Robin Williams , was present as they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the two without a tax-woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid such a yardstick .
Their dominance was absolute , after all , their 39th undefeated commitment , which is also unprecedented .
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not completely reflect the nature of the triumph .
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers , that contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
Like he said he was risky .
I had bladder cancer , which is inoperable , and they did .
If they do n't , it spreads everywhere .
It would have been a pretty bad situation .
It changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station-20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice .
That 's how it starts .
Rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
In the immediacy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
Stanning , who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a mission in Afghanistan , said , `` I was an emotional wreck this week . That may be something extreme , but it means so much. ``
It only repeats how much this means to me how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked .
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin we would be nobody , so a massive thank you to him . He 's the best coach in the world .
I could not have wanted a better person to train or a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years .
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
Even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to unlock , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were very caught at the moment .
Helen cried `` Stay in the process , stay in the process '' .
It 's really important not to be swept away .
We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great .
We did n't want fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
The couple will take a time out for a year before it will make decisions about their future .
Glover must appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backwill .
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did n't mean to say this was my last race .
That would have meant too much pressure .
In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out .
It took about four minutes .
That feels so much better , `` she said .

Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de JANEIRO-The Chinese Ma Long is the new table Tennis Olympic champion .
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and `` defending champion '' Zhang Jike 4:0 ( 12 , 5 , 4 , 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided final .
This brought the world rankings-first the golden Grand slam with successes at world championships , World Cup , world Tour final tournament and even Olympia .
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani .
The two Chinese have made it into the final as expected and made the title among themselves .
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would bring the single title in the Sign of the five rings .
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SVS-nope-Legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea .
Ma and Zhang were left on the record alone , between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches .
They had withdrawn to the grandstand and left their protégés alone in a fair competition .
`` I 've played the matches to this place for my country . ''
`` In the finals I play for myself , '' Zhang had said correctly .
After the match , gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag .
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral .
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first movement really .
He then determined the tempo on the plate and left Zhang with only 13 points .
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected rousing match .
Nevertheless , there were plenty of breathtaking changes to the ball .
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1 .
In his quarterfinals against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov , the Byelorussian had suffered a rib injury , afterwards in medical treatment , had to `` ultimately '' be content with tin .
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner ( 38/2004 ) and Jörgen Persson ( 42/2008 ) , by the way , were in similar high table tennis age Olympia-fourth .

Britain clinches silver in 7-er rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold Holt
The impressive performance of Britain 's 7-er rugby came in the final on Thursday night to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis , when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji awarded a master class in handling , side stepping , back , line and raw power to win gold-their first Olympic medal of any color .
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal-Britain 's fourth on that day-and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
The clear defeat of the Boks , 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
But regardless of this , Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in its best form .
It might be a consolation for GB -- but it probably wo n't -- that at least one Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck : Fiji 's head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind it .
Eight years ago , she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan .
Here they lost only one .
This setback will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started out wonderfully and made the attacks GBS bounce out of fun .
It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in buses . The World Series winners went 5-0 up as Osea Kolinisau in the corner of Rüberhechtete .
With another four minutes of playtime , Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted .
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball .
A an tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fiji .
In the seventh minute lete Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new one since the kick-off and there were still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou dashed by further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal .
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break .
It 's like Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learns .
That 's the way it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes at halftime and closed the Fijianische Gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
Dan Norton started a trial for GB , made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Pacific Islander , whose fans sang , waving flags and danced in the grandstand .
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji .
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
The whistle sounded , the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked devastatingly beaten in the lawn .
Earlier that day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race-Britain 's transformation of the difference .
Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half , but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team , secured the win and thus the silver medal .

Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable .
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer and some colleagues looked for a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach .
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere .
Chio : `` Golden Sport Pyramid '' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they hunted at the fast gallop home to the feed troughs .
One kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
`` It was not a good experience , '' says Langer .
And then the riding career ended again .
On Saturday was Germany 's best golfer of all time-101 tournament wins-again close to horses .
He let himself be led with his family over the plant of the ALRV , on a horse he did not even swing for photographic purposes .
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the Chio .
The reason was quite convincing .
The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sport pyramid to the man from Oberhausen in the context of a small gala .
The likeable athlete does not lack any awards .
Federal Cross of Merit , silver Laurel Leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ...
Even the British Queen has already knighted him .
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
In Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday .
`` This award means a lot to me , '' says Langer , `` because it is awarded not only for sporting successes , but also for social commitment '' .
For decades , long has been promoting young people .
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equal .
With 15 other outstanding athletes , the double US Masterssieger was recorded on Saturday in the `` Hall of Fame of German sports '' .
Among the excellent are the light athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt , the Turner Eberhard Gienger , the fencers Cornelia Hanisch , Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt , the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe , Bob Driver Meinhard , the judoka Frank Wieneke , the equestrian Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich .
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday .
After the official part , the illustrious company moved to the Spring Stadium , where the Lavazza prize ran .
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the great animals .

Trump sees the looming electoral defeat not so tight
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
If there is nothing wrong with the US president 's election , Donald Trump already has an alternative idea .
He 's going on holiday .
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November , it would be relatively irrelevant : `` Ultimately it will either work or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , '' said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC .
If for him in the end it is not enough for reasons of political correctness , that is all right , Trump said .
He called US President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the Islamic State 's terrorist militia ( IS ) .
Within his party , more and more resistance was formed .

Community , mind , health : singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel tipping her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teaching studies she took the music , and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir .
`` Singing moves me -- emotionally and physically , '' she describes .
After a rehearsal she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says .
By the way she does something good for her health and her mind .
After all , singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives , says Erhard Field of the German senior League .
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music , describes field .
Through regular co-existence , seniors can establish and maintain social contacts .
Social and family structures often dissolve in old age , and a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
This experience has also made Ursel tilt in her chorus : `` To speak out and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other-a chorus is a very special form of being together '' .
Singing can be strenuous in a positive sense , says field .
For this , seniors train a deep and controlled breathing .
Those who regularly demand their lungs will not be able to get out of breath in everyday life .
Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
For older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of the senior organizations .
In the older generations , joint singing had a much higher importance , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
Through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia-stricken people are reminding themselves of long-standing events .
When singing , the head is also required to perform a special performance , explains Lenz .
At the same time focus on one 's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers-this is a great cognitive challenge .
Especially older people who live alone are practicing not only to concentrate on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition you learn from singing in the choir , says field .
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment .
Self-esteem is also growing as a result of singing in the choir .
To show oneself : if I practice for a long time , I will be better and grow beyond myself-this experience strengthens .
Good reasons to start singing are enough .
If you want to try out a new hobby , you should not hesitate-even if he thinks you have little talent , Lenz advises .
You do not sing alone-with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
In search of the right offer , seniors have different options , says field .
If someone from the known Circle sings in a senior choir , you can simply join .
Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
Anyone wishing to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church 's head .
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with internet research .
If you want to sing , be sure to join a choir , advise field .
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating-that applies to all ages .

Donald Trump election campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled gun
NEW York : Donald Trump 's campaign has been accused of alleged inaction after it was told that its campaign leader for North Carolina in February had a firearm on an employee while they were on a jeep in February .
The incident is described in a indictment filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte court by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
Bordini stated that he had waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that `` this would not happen . ''
The campaign leader , Earl Philip , `` pulled a pistol , put his right forefinger on the trigger , and rammed the barrel into Vincent 's knee , '' Bordini in his indictment .
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management , Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip , he stated in the indictment .
`` Weapons do n't have to be fired to inflict damage , '' Bordini said .
The indictment comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot , when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the `` Second Amendment people '' firearms owners and gun friends should take action in case his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and appoint judges .
Trump 's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence .
Bordinis complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
Trump 's press spokeswoman Hope Hicks was unable to reach for an opinion .
Attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
WCCB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign member .
He did not respond to calls from his consulting firm , innovative consulting services .
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign .
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc. , 16-CS-14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

There are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .

A serious problem has been for some time now to find housing for the Port refugees who have been recognized .
Local authorities are responsible for connecting accommodation .
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces .
The costs of building , renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the District council to the municipality and job .
Problem : There are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
The search has been very difficult for some time .
In fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
So far , it is not functioning , but it is dependent on private housing , according to Deuschle .
Therefore , municipal apartments have to be strengthened , as it is so beautiful .
So new containers are soon set up in Wasen Street .
But only with apartments it is not done .
Perspective is the keyword , Regine 's customer and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a firm stay , there are internships , training places , school places , one-euro jobs and temporary work for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established .
`` More places would be good , '' reports Regine customer .
Many work in the yard or help janitors , do charitable work-and that is motivated and very tidy , as Annika Deuschle reports .
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact .
That is `` no employment therapy '' .
Activity does not mean only work .
The day need a solid structure , say Deuschle and customer .
People would have to develop a sense of belonging .
So you need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
Professional courses are rare .
So here , too , administration and volunteering .
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcomed in Germany .
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
They need to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can make a meaningful bridge , for example with language courses .
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he can not help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless , he will never integrate .
The clear majority is motivated .
But there are also problem cases , says customer honestly , `` people who do n't do anything '' . The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others .
All this is already a mammoth task .
A difficult question : have the two after the recent occurrences fear of radicalization , even in a small community like Urbach ?
`` No , '' says Regine 's customer quite clearly , `` what some may call naïve '' . However , a residual risk could not be excluded .
But the helpers are already sensitized .
These incidents are also a matter for the refugees .
They have the fear that the assassins will completely discredit them .
`` They want to show that they have nothing to do with it , '' says Regine customer .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
In other words , the local and local volunteers need to look for activities .
In the background , you will always have a new surge of refugees and migrants coming to Urbach .
Does Germany need a ceiling ?
To answer this question clearly , politics is shy .
In fact , it is unfair to provide helpers on the ground .
`` In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go , '' says Annika Deuschle .
No new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Regine 's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already busy integrating the existing people in a sensible sense .
These are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
But if people are in need , they must be helped , both women agree .
The political world is so complicated because there are no easy answers .

Clinton 's and Trump 's economic policy in comparison : it 's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP-that is what both Clinton and Trump want .
However , the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue .
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
The , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy-with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
He himself , by contrast , would be quite different , Trump says .
He will drive back regulations massively , and he makes up for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates-for private individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , on the other hand , says : The state has to perform certain tasks , it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money .
Therefore , the taxes would be increased for the wealthy , she says .
Interestingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
In which must be invested , Trump and Clinton say almost the same word .
The Democratic candidate is announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the Republican state-critical Teaparty wing .
In other words , Trump could still have party-internal discussions .
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the United States .
Oil production is also to be possible in protected areas , the Paris climate Protection agreement intends to cancel .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to use its investment programme to explicitly expand renewable energies and demand : `` A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs . ''
`` It will probably be either China , Germany or America-I want it to be us . ''
But not only in terms of infrastructure , but also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
TPP , the Trans-Pacific trade agreement , do not want to sign either .
At the same time , however , both do not want to isolate the US from international trade-but simply to better protect American jobs .
They 're supposed to pay better , too , calls for Clinton .
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 is a hunger reward .
He wants to raise them to 15 dollars an hour .
What Trump wants to do in this question is not entirely clear : once he says : The minimum wage must go up , then he says he should not be changed .
But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps .
On the one hand is Trump , which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth .
His critics believe that the budget deficit would only be greater .
On the other hand , Clinton is at least asking the rich to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .

Adblock Plus , Facebook in `` Cat and mouse '' with regard to ad blocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers is trying to circumvent ad blocking , a `` cat and mouse '' match .
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop site , Adblock Plus released a blogpost that told users could update their filters in the program to block re-advertising on the social network .
On Tuesday , Facebook informed him that his desktop page would change the encoding of his ads to make it more difficult to detect what part of the advertising page it is viewing blocking .
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes .
In a blogpost , the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote , that `` this kind of back-and-forth struggle between the ad blocking open source community and the outsiders has already been underway since the invention of ad blockaders , '' and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's largest social media company has been put into combat is a strong indication of how worrying ad blocker have become for the industry .
Worldwide , according to a study from last year by Pagefair and Adobe , around 200 million people use ad blocker ; Almost four times as much 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook 's advertising revenue .
The company has it on ads blocker on desktop PCs aside , since mobile ads blocker have no effect on Facebook 's mobile app for the social Network and Instagram , a spokesman shared with .
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step .
On Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its `` Anzeigenpräferenzentool '' to have more control over people 's targeted advertising .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that Adblock 's new filters were worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising .
`` For users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , '' a spokesperson from Facebook shared in an email message .
Ad blocker are a blunt means , which is why we instead focused on developer tools like ad preferences to put more control in people 's hands .

Why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
That 's what I imagine under the women 's olympiamannschaft in gymnastics , and that 's for more than a reason .
Firstly , I have been with each Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
And second , this team has three gymnasts , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren `` Laurie '' Hernandez , who worked inspiring for many young girls of other skin color .
The structure of this team , the Aly Raisman , who is Jewish and Madison Kocian , who is a Catholic , rounds off , makes everyone proud .
This team is finally reflecting the United States .
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
In the last four years , the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American .
Last year , Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
That shows strength .
At the last Olympic Games , Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered .
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez , as they provided unexpected but masterful Gymastikroutinen .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We are experiencing the top of this sport , but this is not the way to see turn classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all hit the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team .
They are the `` last five '' because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team . Moreover , this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer .
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gymnastics , which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training , furnishing , travel clothing , competition and hotel expenses ( for trainers and their gymnasts and families ) . The list can be continued in any way .
The majority of these gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
In these , the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , trainer of Laurie Hernandez , have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics .
We must allow the communities of Aun , many young girls inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie , to have a leistbareres and more accessible Turntrainung .
I founded my Turn foundation of 20 years .
At my events , we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( mainly black and Hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
In September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Gymnastics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determinedness for the mind .
This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
It is the inspiration of this team that will make thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that 's great .
It is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
It 's such an exciting time .
Thank you Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of `` girl power '' by bringing the Olympic team gold and thank you , you are motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their journey , to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

Jennifer Aniston : I 'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does n't always have to be perfect or successful .
This is what the Hollywood star made clear in an interview now .

Tourists in Portugal panicked after a low flying military beach flies over
Sun worshippers in Aveiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A portugisiesches P-3c Orion aircraft of the Air Force put an incredible dive
The Air Force indicated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no security risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists started to panic after a jet flying down a full beach .
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal .
The holidaymakers jumped in when they understandably began to worry about the noise of jet engines without first seeing what was going on in the clouds .
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media , said : `` It really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing . ''
Nuno Arroja added , `` I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . ''
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3c Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
The spokesman said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility of the nearby area fires , but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk .
Land fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people also died on the island of Madeira .
The Portuguese air Forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions-strong fog and fire smoke-which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli prefix was removed after `` Arab '' call-RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli area code , since it had `` requested '' Arab guests according to an employee .
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentary `` Shoah '' , left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper Faz .
During his last stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel .
However , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany ?
Wrote Lanzmann .
Instead , the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center .
Looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The answer he received there , `` shocked him , '' as Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel clerk said that the measure was an `` intentional decision of the management of Kempinski hotels . ''
The reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
`` Most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the area code be deleted , '' the employee of Lanzmann was quoted .
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a `` great shame '' , reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung .
We were horrified and dismayed by this event .
This is really shameful .
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more of a disgrace .
That does not require explanation .
We expect the hotel to `` draw the right conclusions , '' said the official .
The incident triggered a rather large response on the Internet , where people called it a scandal .
Some told the Kempinski hotel that it had `` given up '' the alleged calls of Arab guests .
`` Be ashamed , '' it was said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kurfürstendamm , is near a synagogue .
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident an `` oversight '' and `` apologized '' at Lanzmann , reported the mirror .
`` There was never a direct instruction '' not to include Israel in the Quick list , `` the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski hotel .
It adds that the country code has now been added .

Future of the melting of Portland due to repeal of the energy contract questionable
The future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria , as well as hundreds of workers ' jobs , is at stake as the plant operator is announcing the energy supply contract and thus canceling all supply contracts , as the delivering energy company announced .
This step followed the government 's decision in Victoria earlier this year to award no further subsidies to the operation of the facility .
A subsidy for 20 years expires in November .
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa 's facility in Portland are at stake .
No less than 2000 jobs-direct and indirect-could be at risk of closure .
In addition , domino effects could occur as the melting consumes around 10 percent of Victoria 's total power generation .
In 2014 , Alcoa closed the point Henry Melting , which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alcoa 's melting in Portland is losing money and risking closure .
This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant .
AGL , who supplies the large aluminium melting with his Loy Yang a power plant in Latrobe Valley , said that it is assumed that three other owners will terminate their contracts .
The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina , the Chinese company Citic and the Japanese Marubeni Corp. hold smaller shares .
`` AGL assumes that the Portland facility will continue to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting , '' the company said .
AGL continued to say that the treaties were so-called `` hedges '' , which should have entered into force from November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
`` Therefore , AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17 , '' said the electricity supplier .
All potential effects on revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale current prices .
AGL stated that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its Jahresabschlus of $ 187 million in `` expectation of termination '' .
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts , the `` ability of Alcoa ... to operate the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting '' is not affect .
The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to enter into force from November this year , even if it is still guilty of a statement as to why it has resigned from the treaty .
Analysts warn about the poor economic situation of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle .
In reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , the head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts per year and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity .
If both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [ electricity market ] .
And for us as power generators , that would n't be good , `` he said .

Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide
A British traveller underwent a serious test of his immune system and gag reflex by licking some of Europe 's dirtiest and most disgusting places .
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk scraped his course on a euro bill , a railing at Piccadilly Circus , a flush of a toilet , and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system .
Before licking each object , he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get into .
But the experiment , which was filmed under the title `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner strength '' , brought some surprising results to daylight .
The idea of licking the flush of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
On his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the development of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
Luckily , nothing left him licking more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things .
From public railings at railway stations to washing-up knobs of toilets , the task was to definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film he said : `` As a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film he was able to live up to his reputation .
The only thing he refused was a dirty public restroom in Russia .
His trial smear showed a Luminometerzahl of over 4000 units .
In comparison , the Luminometerzahl of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their Luminometerzahl over 4000 units of fraud , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' , which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom .
In the film he says : `` This comes close to the worst I have smelt in a toilet . ''
There 's nothing more filthy than that !
I 'm not going to lick anything here because it 's disgusting inside .
`` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio .
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio gefilus containing lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the development of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Valios senior Venice president for snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` We really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics .
We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying , `` Let 's call Ian . ''
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hakala , who directed the film , added , `` Let me say so -- I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had instructed him to lick , like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie . ''
Of course , there were things that made it easier to get Ian to lick her and others where it was quite difficult .
I 'm glad we 've taken some of these filthy treats on film. ``
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 , 84 percent of all interviewed lactic acid bacteria , in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines , and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria .

Thirty-eight years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water Zweckverbands `` Veitensteingruppe '' , Ruppert Göller , is retiring .
The association is considered to be `` Bavaria 's most exemplary '' .
A small Franconian drinking water Association as a model for the large water producers .
So it was said some time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Broadcasting .
Shortly thereafter , the Water Forum of the Government of under Franconia acknowledged the purpose of the association .
The work of the Veitensteingruppe is considered to be exemplary .
Behind all this stands Rupert Göller , who was 31 years in the purpose of association staff , 28 years as managing director .
Now he was retired at the age of 65 years .
The Drinking Water Association The Veitensteingruppe , based in Kottendorf , municipality of Brunn , annually promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants .
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch Lauter , Breitkopf , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the town .
For other towns and municipalities there are water supply .
The current chairman , Mayor Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water warden in 1985 and was appointed managing Director of the Purpose Association in 1988 .
`` His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from Wasserleitungsbau and maintenance work to office and organisational activities , the preparation of budgets , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends , '' said the chairman .
As outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new Wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new Wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurbishment of the High Reservoirs ( 1999 ) , the repurchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
There has been no standstill and there have always been new additions , because water is life and drinking water is the most important foodstuff .
In her eulogy she praised Göllers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
He has used his passion for his water association and he has lived the water association as if it were his own company .
A few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction in front of the water Forum of the District under Franconia .
He received a great deal of recognition and praise for this .
Rupert Göller , on his part , praised Water wart Alfons Griebel , who worked with him for 28 years .
He 's the best water wart and he was a loyal squire .
Together we were an unbeatable team .
As a high point from his point of view he described the well-being and the restructuring of the purpose Association .
The biggest challenge and the most difficult bet were the pipe at the high reservoir at Kirch Lauter on a 3rd January .
Here , at minus 17 degrees , the whole night had to work , so that the localities could be supplied with water .
It was also possible to maintain the supply of the Brunn only , because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses .
The management of the drinking water zweckverbandes was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauterbrunnen , who succeeded Rupert Göller .

England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
For me , this was the biggest attraction in Heathrow , just as it was in London in 2012 , when we were doing a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End .
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow .
For our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs , and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
Just as you were ahead of us in London in 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage .
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be mistaken at Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcome , but Heathrow answers each question asked .
Like the Olympic Games , Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £211 billion in witschaftlichem growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport as well as all over the UK .
We have a great team at Heathrow , which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T5 , which was voted the world 's best airport terminal for five consecutive years , to the T2 built in the midst of the world 's two busiest catwalks .
Now you are ready to deliver a third catwalk , which is supported by £16 billion in private investment .
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and to expand Heathrow , thereby securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
The State must act prudently and resolutely at the same time to respond to terrorist threats .
Surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
We will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
However , if offenders had to leave the country sooner , the security and strength also increased the public 's consent to the refugee policy .
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the federal election of 2017 .
He also announced a further personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely `` in a medium four-digit order over several years '' .
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must again be punished .
Video surveillance is to be improved , the gun law is amended so that , above all , the purchase of weapons on the internet is complicated .
The last much discussed silence obligation for doctors is to be maintained according to de maizières words .
However , in a dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to find solutions to how to reduce the vulnerability of citizens , he said with regard to psychic abnormalities .
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees , the Minister considers that better social care is necessary .
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people .
To prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( darknet ) , de Maizière plans to use concealed investigators .
SPD chief Gabriel said : `` The SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to increase security further '' .
It is important that the interior Minister clearly spoke out against Actionism .
`` That was a slap for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU , '' said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funk Media Group ( Friday ) .
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the union after a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
A general ban on full obfuscation is problematic for constitutional law .
You can not forbid everything you reject , and I reject wearing the burqa .
We can talk about rules , for example , in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
Green boss Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate energy and ability to act with ever-new anti-terrorist packages .
Left-party chief Bernd Riexinger said : `` Fleet Proverbs and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to people in this country '' .

A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was in the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , `` she relocated and left the shop without buying anything . ''
She said , `` People could n't believe what they saw . ''
Standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of underpants from the delivery , pulled out her own pantyhose and trousers and tried them .
`` She did n't even try to find a more discreet place to do it-she just stood there , naughty like Oskar . ''
`` Everyone stared when they took off the underpants , which they obviously did n't like , since they put them back on the shelves . ''
She repeated the same with three more underpants , before finally decided that she liked nothing , again attracted herself and outed .
`` She did n't seem to mind that she was watching someone -- or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried . ''
Ms. Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said , `` how disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear with another person and who were not washed . ''
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms. Davidson added , `` As I have heard , the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went-which is just as good . ''
`` I 'd hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and took them out again and they were n't washed . ''
A spokesman for Primark said : `` Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9th in our branch in Folkestone . ''
All eligible products were drawn from the sale .

Haigerloch : Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The altar from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg .
Four stages have been managed together .
In order to bridge the time to the next ' of all altar in probably two years , the Oberministrantenrunde St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage lasting several days .
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally , it was decided for the Bishop 's City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the Open Gate of Mercy at the Freiburg Minster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Minis from Bittelbronn , Gruol , Haigerloch and holy rooms made their way .
The evening before , Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pilgrims ' crosses and granted the pilgrim blessing .
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen , where there is also a cathedral of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage from Münster was started .
The individual day trips were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
But also on the way , the Minis on field crosses , chapels or churches repeatedly made a rest to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrim Liedheft .
The church of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays .
At the stage goals , Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made for a tasty as well as invigorating dinner and breakfast .
It continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach .
The next day , the stage to St. Peter , which was the most route , had to be climbed at first around 500 meters of altitude and then re-ascended after a sultry heat .
The deserved reward was a communal barbecue at the Badweiher .
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing convent church of St. Peter , the final stage went to Freiburg .
Visibly relieved and happily , the Minis met at the Freiburg Minster later in the afternoon and passed through the Gate of Mercy .
With a little impulse , God was thanked here .
At the evening fair in Münster , the Minis of Kooperator Markus Obert arrived at the Pilgrim 's destination .
After the service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar .
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole .
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train .
At the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .

Culture of political correctness makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year at the instigation of a government report due to corruption from office
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
The former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police , election observers and halls to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to `` over-sensibilities regarding ethnicity and religion '' .
The former Minister of Integration and local government , who is now a Antkorruptionskönig , said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of election booths to protect intimidated voters .
He recommends that voters should carry a passport to prove their identity in elections .
At the moment , a voter only has to name and address .
The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person 's finger when they make their vote to prevent someone from dialing twice .
Whistleblowers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups .
`` This serves not only to counter electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that accompanies it , '' he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the tower Hamlet 's electoral scandal in east London .
Last year , a Sonderwahlgericht decided that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community `` in a cynical way '' and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobienanschuldigungen .
Rahman is said to have `` led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . ''
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
He expressed himself in particular alarmingly to fraudulent absentee ballot-in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading identification , to prove the identity
In his report it states : ' It was established that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , in particular women and young people , in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeschischem background .
`` There were concerns that ... State institutions would knowingly ignored such behavior due to '' politically correct `` oversensibilities regarding ethnicity and religion . ''
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists from editing letter-dial documents to stop `` picking '' .
The report , which is being considered by Theresa May , also calls for tougher registry checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud .
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card .
Use non-removable ink on a person 's finger once she has given her voice to prevent someone from dialing twice .
Carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are entitled to vote .
A three-year limit on requests for automatic absentee ballot .
Prohibiting political activists from working on complete mail options and envelopes of letter elections .
Give the police the power to set up barricades around electoral stations .
A change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 ( the 1983 Act of Representation ) .
Ban in electoral stations .
Requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
Intensifying the training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go alone in the voting booth .
Sir Eric Falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it `` amazing '' that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was made .
`` The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for use due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , '' he said .
It has been pleaded guilty for a number of reasons , in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
He also criticizes the ineffective `` checkbox controls '' of the election registration departments of the halls .
Sir Eric said , `` the court ruling in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal .
Our country is a proud heir to Parliament 's mother , but the worrying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : the first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion : The Nokia Communicator came to market 20 years ago .
The successors dominate the world today-its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iphone 5 .
It was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand either .
On the contrary , it was quite clunky .
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes , which would be enough today for about two high resolution selfies .
An iphone is now delivered at least 16 gigabytes .
The `` Nokia 9000 Communicator '' arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15th , 1996 , in the shops-and it was the first smartphone .
For a few euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
Twenty years ago , however , the communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair CeBIT in Hanover as `` office in the West pocket-sized '' .
In fact , the new mobile phone could be used for then standards a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax the Communicator was reachable .
Even access to Web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit excruciatingly slow .
A calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the phone could be opened up similar to a laptop .
Then found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
The price was quite proud : 2700 D-mark , i.e . about 1400 euros .
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
Everything has changed since then .
The smart phones are a success story , albeit not for Nokia .
The Finns ' cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled .
Today the market is dominated by vendors who all came much later than Nokia .
Be online anytime and anywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday .
In 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
About 1.4 billion units were sold , with Samsung and Apple alone 555 million .
Worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
In addition , there are the well-running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac world the introduction of the iphone .
He promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communicator , all by touch screen easy to use .
The triumph of Apple began , even today , the iphone is the group 's most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and BlackBerry , who dominated the market , had a look .
They eventually disappeared , BlackBerry has to fight .
The saying now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
On average , every German now looks to his mobile phone 88 times a day .
`` We all have to learn how to put the smartphone to the point , '' said Janina Ball , who is in charge of the Siemens Board of Management for personnel .
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and a blessing .

Russia and Turkey : an `` alliance of outsiders '' ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions .
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can not resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
There was a handshake , yes .
But Putin 's smile worked-and he barely radiated warmth , even for his restrained relationships .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his `` dear friend '' Putin-according to a report , whole five times .
I could n't count it anymore .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis , but would even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have acted as if something bad had never happened .
His enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite .
But a sustainable coolness that Putin radiated showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : The launch of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was furiously .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into Russia 's back .
The offense was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
Rebuilding the trust will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , the state-controlled media conducted a fierce , unrestricted attack on Ankara .
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
Most seriously , the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan 's own family would have benefited from the illicit trade in Syria in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State .
He vehemently denied this .
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan , whom he wanted to hear .
Russia could be a kind of victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a truce are clearly obvious .
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office in a failed coup last month .
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard-in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
The number has decreased by almost 90 % .
In Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed .
They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
This week , the state television forecasts cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish imports are allowed again .
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows : `` Tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak answer .
In addition , there is the continuing resentment of the snail speed of the EU accession negotiations and Putin-eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey 's relationship with the west .
The Russian head of state , in Ankara , certainly won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup d'état .
This is a matter of course for Moscow , which has itself a deep-seated fear of regime change .
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray , as an analyst once described , `` Alliance of Outsiders '' : two countries that are in violation of the West and feel badly treated and now ally .
Nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role of peacemaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched the subject .
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize it .
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria .
But after months of open hostilities-and given the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet-it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk again .

Rain instead of shooting stars : Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-shooting peepers in the southwest of Germany on the night of Friday a stroke through the bill-but there is still hope .
The night was ill-suited for clouds and rain to observe the spectacle of the sky , said the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim , Hans-Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
Our hope is on the night of Saturday .
The weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see many shooting stars in the sky .
The star scales are Perseids , which belong to the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometers per hour .
They have their name because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus , which is emerging in the northeast .

Simone Biles creates gold in women 's gymnastics
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all this .
Dynamic on the leaping horse .
Effortlessly on the bar .
Breathtaking on the ground .
Brilliant all over the place .
And now finally also Olympic champion .
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to the more combat title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medallist and `` final five '' teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina .
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the hovering beam during the single-more combat final of the women in gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a more battle title and totals the fifth as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment .
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated the last three years of its sport , 15 World Cup medals-including 10 gold medals-won with such amazing exercises , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton of hers said that she is `` the best gymnast I have ever seen . ''
She expected a final test in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations .
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in spring , Texas would be considered disappointment .
The Americans Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman hug each other after they have won gold and silver in the singles final of the Women in the art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as an exclamation mark .
Although Biles insisted that , during their long journey to the top , never planned to have the future , this is not really true .
Part of your ground exercises-which include your typical tumbling pass-is tuned to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
It 's not a coincidence .
This girl , who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by coach Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion to the gym in which Boorman trained , became a force .
Since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more fighting competition , a series of winnings that will last as long as Biles wishes .
Even if Mustafina led by two turns easily , the picture deceived .
Hovering beams and ground gymnastics-in which Biles holds the world Championship title-lurked .
She picked up again with 15.433 on the levitation beam again-and put a 15.933 on the floor another on it .
Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her Endergbnis -- a mere formality -- and tears poured on Biles gleaming red , white , and blue eyeliner , as the vision she once described in her scrapbook became reality .
The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina .
This time , the 22-year-old team captain named `` Grandma '' by the Americans had a head start .
After her ground exercise , she threw Kusshände at the audience , overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious .
As far as Biles is concerned , the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning :

Frankie Dettori reaches Predilection for his 3,000-ten win at Newmarket
Dettori sparkles champagne after a double at Newmarket , which brings him 3,000 ten prizes
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000-th British win at Newmarket on Friday .
He put on Predilection , which is coached by John Gosden , on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
The three-time winner , Dettori , who won in front of Ghayyar , said , `` It 's something special . ''
I 'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago .
It 's not a big meeting , it 's not Royal Ascot-it 's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am relieved and very humble .
Dettori picks up the cheers as he brings victory to Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race-jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
He has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight room .
He is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charisma fans have been enthusiastic for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have brought 6,000 winnings if he was n't just a weekend and big tournament jockey !
Frankie has already ridden almost 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
He has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
It was nerve-wracking .
A whole series of big tournament wins , including his famous `` Glorious Seven '' in 1996 in Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban .
Three years ago , he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month lock , but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best .
And he is still far from the end-Dettori has once said that he wants to continue at competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .

Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades cluster .
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars revolve in the cluster at different rates and in which context the rotation periods are related to the formation of planets .
`` We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age , and even the history of his solar system , '' said Luisa Rebull , a researcher at Caltech 's Infrared processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The cluster of stars of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from Earth .
Many stars in this cluster of stars , which arose about 125 million years ago , now reach adulthood .
They 're turning out the fastest .
At peak rotation rates , these ripening stars emit large amounts of stellar winds .
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
When a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun spots .
The latest catalogue of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones .
`` In the '' ballet `` of the Pleiades , we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars , '' Rebull said .
As the cluster of stars of the Pleiades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
`` The cluster of stars of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , '' said Rebull .
There is still much ahead of us about what we would like to know more about , how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and , so to speak , hang their `` dance shoes '' .
And their colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades , which will soon appear in the Astronomical journal .

`` One generation protests '' in Ethiopia , long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia came up against the government 's violent resistance .
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in the event of gunshots .
Is Ethiopia just collapsing ?
In the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the west with a fast-growing economy .
But in recent months , protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
Last week , thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
According to human rights organizations , the Government 's response was ruthless .
Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators .
Circulating videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand-held against a wall .
The head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands an in-depth investigation .
`` It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , '' said Rashid Abdi , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . Only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia 's economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
Its infrastructure has improved drastically-there is a new commuter in the capital city of Addis Ababa .
The streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy-human rights organizations have continually led the oppression of the government-the opposition in the country has been curtailed , with dissidents effectively silenced .
Many were sent to exile or to prison , killed or driven into the vast expanse of the desert .
But that could change .
`` If you suppress people and have no other options other than protest , it breaks out , '' said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
The entire youth protested .
One generation protests .
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticized election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament .
At the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea ; A struggle for this jagged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden , who have been more or less vanquished in recent years , can exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves .
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of pre-Hinköchelnsing under the surface now explode .
The first seems harmless : smartphones .
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and the Internet services have improved .
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying .
Several young Ethiopians stated that they were thus gathered to protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
For eons , prospered Amharas , which come from Äthopiens predominantly Christian Highlands , in politics and economy , while they yielded the Oromos , many of which are Muslims and live in lowland lands .
But that also changes right now .
`` We are about to coordinate under one umbrella , '' said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of the Oromos .
The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr. Meles , a former rebel leader , was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death in an unpublicized disease in 2012 17 years .
He was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
Analysts say he was particularly adept at perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special envoys to deal with opponents and make them harmless .
`` The current regime lacks this basic skill , '' said Mr. Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopia 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take on the position of Mr Meles .
Unlike Mr. Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services .
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005 , after thousands of counter-elections were protested , according to analysts , apparently botched by the government and subsequently stolen .
During the ensuing raids , many protesters were killed , even though it was less than in the last few months and this time of unrest was passing relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter , and for their measurable progress in combating poverty .
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian Government 's internal grudge .
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month , protesters attacked in Gondar , a Amharic city , from Tigray-led businesses and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in social media .
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over neighboring Somalia , even though she recently said that it has closed this base .
While the West is clearly willing to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
`` This , '' said Mr. Abdi , `` is a very thin tightrope hike . ''

Despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance at the Olympic time trial , professional Tony Martin does not want to be caught .
`` I keep a look at the World Cup , remain confident and fight further , '' wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
He did not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar .
`` I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday 's time trial , '' said Martin .
He had to analyse in peace the reasons for the debacle .
At the world Championship in October in Qatar , Martin was really trying to fight for the title .
`` I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . ''
`` This is also my position '' , wrote the three-time world champion , who lost on Wednesday on the 54.5 km more than three minutes to the Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara ( Switzerland ) .

Military leadership distorts ISIS Secret Service information , Committee of Congress notes
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed , a congressional committee of Inquiry reported in a report on Thursday .
The preliminary report , created by a task force of the Republican members of the Streitkräftekommitees , Geheimdienstkommitees and the Wehrbudgetkommites , reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
The Central Command , abbreviated Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` Intelligence information , which were typically nod by high-ranking CENTCOM commanders , regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground had allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , '' a newspaper article quoted the report .
`` What happened in the CENTCOM is unacceptable-our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , '' said Ken Calvert , Republican member of the House of Representatives .
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization .
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces .
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` During the first six months of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts '' , the report noted .
For example , a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin already in April or May 2015 .
Mosul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
`` After months of investigation , is so clear . '' said Mike Pompeo , Republican congressman from Kansas , in an opinion .
From mid-2014 to mid-2015 , Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq .
The Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were concerned about manipulating reports on the Islamic State .
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
In addition , further investigations of the CENTCOM reports by the inspector General of the Ministry of Defence are underway .
Democratic members of the Nachrichtendienstekomittees published their own findings on Thursday , which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force .
`` In the years 2014 and 2015 , the Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services , '' the ranking Democrat in the committee , member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff , announced in an opinion .
This process , Mr. Schiff , `` delayed the publication of intelligence reports , '' damaged morale among analysts and `` gave excessively little room for divergent opinions . ''
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that they had not found any evidence of a White House 's intervention in the CENTCOM analysts regarding a `` certain political opinion '' .
The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by `` The Daily Beast '' .
Last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the General Inspector of the Pentagon , which were recorded after complaints from CENTCOM analysts .
Lt. Cmdr . Patrick Evans , a press officer at the Pentagon , stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on congressional reports , while the investigations of the General inspector were still underway .
But he also stated that `` experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . ''
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Defense Ministry ) .
However , the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the central command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago , as a CENTCOM analyst , Gregory Hooker , a document written about how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , had only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
Last year , the team of Mr. Hooker stated , according to government agencies , contrary to the Government 's statements against the refiners held by the Islamic State , there would be no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
However , this knowledge was not published , The Times reported in September .
Centcoms then commander , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin was retired in April and was passed by the Central Command . Replaced Joseph L. Votel .

A controversial baseball star kicks off
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in best days from base to base .
After his emotional resignation , the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time on August 12th against the Tampa Bay Rays .
`` I love this game and this team . ''
`` I say goodbye to both , '' explained the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signature under a ten-year contract has given him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
Until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach-with full salary .
As a player , Rodriguez paid back for a long time with performance .
With 696 home , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( `` runs '' ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001-2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees he made some milestones .
With the hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important stats .
However , the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the Hall of Fame of baseball .
For so successful Rodriguez-nickname `` A-Rod '' -was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place .
As early as 2009 , the superstar at `` ESPN '' admitted to having banned steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 he was banned for 211 games due to a involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered to have been the main suspect for years to receive performance-enhancing means through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida .
After a lawsuit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
`` The league could have done me a favor for 2014 , because I 've been playing for 20 years without a break , '' said Rodriguez at the time of smug .
Even his farewell days do not go silently .
While many baseball legends still get the big stage in their last games , Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench .
`` My job does n't include a farewell tour . ''
`` My job involves trying to win every game , '' Etched Yankees coach Joe Girardi .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and said to the relationships with popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee Arch Boston Red Sox .
`` We want A-rod '' , the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on Facebook to the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis .
In December 2014 , he had brought gold for the first time at the world Championships in Doha , and at the same time he set his record at the beginning .
Now , the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself in front of his critical ex-teammates on Facebook protecting himself .
`` In a country where an Olympic champion gets €20,000 bonus and a jungle king €150,000 should not wonder about missing medals , '' wrote the 26-year-old at night to Friday on his Facebook page .
The conveyor system in swimming is bad , but the doping controls are very good .
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote very much and do not look at or even operate on doping .
`` I am not saying that the controls should be discontinued here , '' he explained .
If he wanted to start a comeback , Deibler would have already been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany ( NADA ) .
This is exactly the way to keep it with countries .
`` Those who can not be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA for a certain amount of time before WM/OS may not participate '' , demands the Hamburg-based election , which now operates an ice cream parlor .

Rio 2016 : Robel Kiros have become internethit
The Olympians or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games .
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
In the aquatic center , the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures .
He just disappeared-no matter how far the neckline was selected .
In the social networks , they then became viral Internethit .
In fact , the 24-year-old ended its lead with a backlog of 48 seconds and occupied the 59 . Place of 59 starters .
But it was rather its not just a sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
The Ethiopian was given a start to the International Swimming Federation .
This is being distributed to make swimming in the underrepresented countries more famous .
Since in Ethiopia most athletes run , they just wanted to do something different .
Preparation is everything : Robel Kiros got ready for the big race .
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds .
Some media referred to him as `` Robel of the Whale '' .
Following a `` Prosperity belly '' , the English tabloid `` The Sun '' made fun of him with `` dad bod '' .
His time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle , played no role .
Comparisons with `` Eric the Eel '' were also drawn .
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Moussambani 's run provided media attention .
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete on his own in a prerun of 100 metres of freestyle .
frenetically , Moussambani was cheered at that time .
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Raiffeisen Bank Gmund at Tegernsee is asking for wealthy savers in future punitive interest rates-as the second Institute in Germany .
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : `` It 's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily money accounts '' .
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : normal savers would not have to worry about paying a rate for their savings .
If banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate .
From September onwards , Raiffeisen Bank Gmund will demand this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on Giro or daily money accounts .
`` The first 100,000 euros are free . ''
`` The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future , '' said Paul .
For quite some time he has been herding 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not revalue .
`` They lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , '' said the chief .
`` I ca n't lie down for every million 4000 euros . ''
The costs are now passed on to the polluter-pays principle .
Simply leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisen bank would be far too dangerous : `` I have already experienced four raids , I do not like the fifth ! '' said the bank 's board .
Most customers would have understood and switched to other forms of investment .
Only a few migrated to other banks .
The Bavarian Cooperative Association declared : `` The ECB 's extreme monetary policy stance is causing significant costs for all banks . ''
To bear them alone is `` not economically feasible '' .
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounting , credit cards or bank transfers .
With penalty interest for deposits of EUR 3 million , the Thuringian people 's and Raiffeisen bank Altenburger Land had made headlines with their Skatbank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kemmer , chief executive officer of the Banking Association , said : `` We do not expect private customers to have to pay nationwide for deposits , so competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong '' .
A banker said that at Tegernsee there was `` a clientele endowed with wealth more luxuriant '' .
`` This can be a small bank to the problem '' if you have free money hats .
The Cooperative bank Gmund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach-Egern , Kreuth and Tegernsee .
Famous actors , sportsmen and entrepreneurs live in the region .
At present , no other banks are known to the Cooperative Association of Bavaria , which charge a reimbursement for deposits from private customers , `` said spokesman Ernst .
The President of the Federal Association of German People 's banks and Raiffeisen Banks ( BVR ) , Uwe Fröhlich , had declared at the end of June : `` The threshold of going into negatives towards the private customer is very , very high '' .
The competition is fierce and there is a threat of the emigration of investors to competition .
Customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in the broadest possible range .

Better traffic flow on the highway feeder
It regularly jams on the ring road-here is a picture of November .
But this should change : the legal lane should be extended .
This is good news for all drivers who are in traffic jams on the road every night when they drive through the motorway feeder ( a 43 ) .
The state-run road construction extends on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16/17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the exit Wesel Straße the right turn lane by 700 meters .
Drivers can then directly thread right from the hammer road .
The big advantage : the traffic is divided more early , which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the federal Road 51 .
The idea with the extended exit was the CDU group in the district representation Münster-West .
The road narrowing on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock .
On weekdays , the backlog reaches the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond .
Reason is the needle on the B 51 just before the exit Wesel Straße .
From here the traffic is only single via the motorway bridge .
The second track had to be built back well three years ago .
The reason : Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity , in particular to take two lanes of heavy traffic .
How long this bottleneck and the associated work will last a daily congestion can not be said by the competent State company .
However , it is to be reckoned with years : because the bridge has an official residual useful life until the year 2034 .
For the extension of the legal Lane , the national company deliberately chose the less favourable time during the school holidays because of the difficulties with disabilities .
The traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday single at the construction site .

Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt 's proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association 's officials , but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted at an election refused him .
In July , Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the treaty and said that the NHS would be in a `` No Man 's Land '' and any further delay would be detrimental to the employees and patients .
The first interns are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of inhospitable times .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the chairman of the BMA committee for assistant doctors informed last night in a communication saying : `` Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will fuel the current staff crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly . ''
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out .
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks came at the government 's reluctance to participate and sometimes on deafening silence .
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just made last month that his door would always be open .
`` Jeremy Hunt must now act , repeal the enforcement and address the concerns of the assistant doctors . ''
If he does not do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further industrial action .
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nurses and medical specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the picket line .
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the British Medical Association officials .
The BMA wants a better Wochendentlohnung for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , director-General of the NHS staff , called on the assistant doctors to end the strike .
Mortimer said : `` Work-related action does not achieve anything of the least , but burdens already overloaded teams and service providers , and they only provide care , distress and interruption to patients , carers and their families '' .
In the last two months , we have spoken to the committee of Assistant doctors and have responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and Whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries .
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important issues-such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from a professional time-out Schulungsksten , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine-a sign of how serious it was for employers , the health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BMA in November , February and May .

Old buildings , a few linden trees , in between a remnant of cobblestones : The Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight , but the police are one of the `` dangerous places '' of the city .
Walking down the street from east to west , you will pass by playgrounds , a freshly painted kindergarten and a grocery store .
Someone sprayed `` ugly ! '' on the façade of a grey house .
Opposite of a Lidl , which is to be demolished soon , is already built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rented apartments will be created .
Articles about this `` trendy district '' , as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls , are , however , in the last weeks preferably illustrated with burning cars .
The reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have lease agreements , but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events .
Since the beginning of the year , Berlin 's senator Henkel , in particular , had repeatedly spoken out for a crackdown on the project by the police , the area as a `` no-go zone '' for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
On the 22nd of June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kadterschmiede , with 300 police officers had been vacated , patrolled the police for three weeks , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
Meanwhile , construction workers refurbished the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners .
On July 13th , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers withdrew under the cheers of sympathizers and residents .
This summer afternoon the road is peaceful : Parents walk with children , people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the Sun , others entertain themselves before late .
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens .
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and Jana * , which draws three children , are mainly annoyed by the police presence .
With the residents of the house projects they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification .
It does not sound like a neighborhood that has a majority wished for police protection from Vandalierenden left .
The ditch that the Berlin Interior senator and the police open between squatters and their neighbors does not seem to exist .
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district , which also today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city .
House occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the neighbourhood : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse near the Rigaer .
While the mainzers had been evacuated under great police command in a regular street battle , many of the projects were legalized in the Rigas and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
At the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and the choice of Berliners from all over the world in recent years : with them , residents from GDR times and former squatters now share their neighborhoods .
This is also noticeable in the rents , which have risen by almost 60 percent in the case of newcomers since 2009 .
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on the rolled-up discs or freshly painted facades that have been pelteded with color bags .
No other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words `` left-autonomous violence '' .
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen .
Most of the offences are subject to damage that tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in a tenement house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no question of uncertainty .
As for acts of violence , it is appeasing : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they certainly have not been .
Even the famous burning cars have been out of the rigaer for a long time .
For the architect studied her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : `` Here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other , than elsewhere '' .
Neugebauer was deliberately dragged into the Riga road-and remained .
That 's why it was so important to her that residents get back their streets : From the police , politics and the media , who all of a sudden claimed the sovereignty over the district in July .
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer , the road continues to be taken away from them : through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants .
`` These are , after all , condos that are not interesting for many here-people who are not so well-heeled , '' she says .
`` I absolutely can not tolerate violence and destruction . ''
But what do you do if someone never listens ?
There is frustration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
For those who are annoyed by color bombs , Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding : the House projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood .
Those who move here should be aware of this-just like someone who pulls into a pub district , can complain about noise there badly .
All people presented with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name

The £2-per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug after the authorities have been recommended to administer this to more people for a longer period of time .
The anti-clotting drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
The drug is already being administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
The NHS 's nice regulatory authority has recommended a four-year-long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
The NHS 's nice regulatory authority has recommended a four-year-long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulating fatty material in the arterial walls that form surfaces .
When the lining breaks apart , it can cause a blood clot that clogs the bloodstream to the heart , causing a heart attack .
When the clot dissolves , it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having one more .
Ticagrelor , which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely .
Nice 's tutorial design , published today , recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a two-day dose of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director of the Nice Health technology Evaluation Centre , said : `` Despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or a stroke-often follow with disastrous . ''
The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
Experience shows that ticagrelor , in combination with aspirin , is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor-especially the risk of bleeding-is limited to a period of up to three years . The guidance draft does not recommend any treatment beyond this period .

Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the chief Executive officer of Bank only , the RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross McEwan shared with BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected with the bank 's global ambitions .
The bank has since distanced itself , when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago .
During this time , brand strategists have used `` RBS '' to protect other end users ' financial brands .
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray .
But now she has decided to put more national brands in the spotlight .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales all RSB references , the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be changed to NatWest .
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important-Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's military bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire .
He said to BBC Scotland : `` The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . ''
When the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became a global brand .
I am saying now that we are not pursuing global objectives , but local objectives .
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
RBS has already testified that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
`` It is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? '' said the chief Executive officer .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would have launched these brands .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think one will see many changes .
We can re-launch these brands , so I think the time has come .

In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are , whatever the time , it 's the Olympic Games .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inevitably , a frenzied relay race between competition and aspirations .
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is handed from the crossbow to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete .
You ca n't turn on the TV , read a newspaper , or listen to your neighbor 's conversation in the coffee queue , without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky , or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there 's Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples , could well have been among these well known names sent to prime time , built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising , if he were a swimmer , gymnast or even fencer .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline gymnastics .
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event .
Further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : Aerial pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time .
But if I could humbly make arguments for my particular darling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it debuted in Sydney , it has been so sparsely perceived for the last 16 years that many who , I had questioned , did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
This could also be regional ignorance .
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete who made it to the finals by 2012 .
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm , partly because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a earthbound enthusiast .
It has humorous potential-the kartoonhafte tremor of its never-ending lingers impact-but also the grace of gymnastics and diving , the two sports that it essentially unites .
The word `` trampoline '' comes from the Spanish El Trampoline , which means as much as `` springboard . ''
Aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements ( turning , pikes and somersaults ) before they land on their feet .
According to the official Olympia programme , they are rated according to their execution , difficulty and `` flight time '' .
Thirty athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
Medal hopefuls must go further in their pursuit of gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
They not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall , but also a further scornful goal in television broadcasting : those of the world or the Olympic record .
The purposeful pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatical-and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears .
But it is also what I perceive as a bit tiring even when watching these games .
The trampoline offers a respite .
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above .
Moving forward is not the goal .
He or she bounces off , seemingly weightless as an astronaut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back up .
Here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target , no bulging in the distance , only the dreamy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
The qualification and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon , streaming at 13.00 Eastern time ; The men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of a Nachmittagblocks on both days from 14.00 .
In the midst of the Olympia mania you promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil .
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Angaffen and the objectification of male athletes-as the male US gymnasts have recently suggested according to the Wall Street Journal-then Mr. Dooley expects his air-ringing , new fan base .

Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led a too small co-determination right to the team 's decision-making process .
Alternative president/General manager of Colorado 's Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach .
`` For the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determinedness , '' commented the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion .
Over the course of the summer , I 've been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , need it , and bring it to a higher level .
To achieve this , the trainer 's vision and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned to that of the organization .
It must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
These conditions are not met at the moment .
Sakic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked him for his contributions to the team .
`` Patrick has informed me of this decision today , '' said Sakic .
We all appreciate what he has done for our Organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the central vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last two years of the post season .
The avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and dropped five points behind the game for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference .
As a hall of Fame goalkeeper , Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .

The depressing food of the economic crisis in `` an abundant meal ''
In March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office .
As a foodie , President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as pâte de foie gras and Maryland water Schildkrötensuppe .
His menu on that day was somewhat humbler : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding .
`` It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , '' said Jane Ziegelman .
Her husband Andrew Coe added , `` It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . ''
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coes last book `` Chop Suey '' was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegelman in her book `` 97 Orchard '' tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
Her latest collaboration , `` A decent meal '' that will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg 's Sandwich shop for dinner , a small , straightforward snack in the Flatiron district , which has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash .
Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive scraps , while Coe , 57 , ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered Meatloaf , this was due to the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
`` Rich foods were very popular , '' said Ziegelman .
There was peanut bread , loaf and bean bread .
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve you as dinner .
Coe grinned .
`` It must have been placed in the stomach like lead , '' he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all-you-can-eat buffet .
Women 's teams cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
They were the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War . `` A square Meal '' records the ways in which the country was no longer the land of paradise .
`` It was a time when food for the Americans became a central , tense topic , '' Begündete Coe , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
Equally tense was the new budget diet : Mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods , the casserole as `` wonderful way to eat leftovers recycle , '' noted Ziegelman , as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
Meat , which was the focus of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
Peculiar mixes were tried , as a calorie and nourishing gratification had precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind .
During her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a dish from that epoch , baked onions with peanut butter .
`` It was not a popular addition to the Mittagstsich , '' says Coe .
Brick man goes on : `` It was surreal . ''
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match .
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes .
Like never before or ever since , household economists-including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943-drove the eating habits of the country in such a way .
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become `` household politicians '' and to meet the challenge of turning mush like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
`` A square meal '' is a feast of historical tidbits .
Particularly palatable are the reports of the Government 's response to the starving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoover 's Lass-me-cake-eating posture .
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen , he dined like the million-dollar man of the world to which he has become .
`` He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce , '' said Coe .
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo .
He was gloriously alien to reality .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake , unless his wife Eleanor asked him to make an example with his stomach .
As described in the book , hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most bleakly prepared. ``
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet .
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegelman , as well as on how science was applied to food .
The couple gave a better understanding of Ziegelmans 's eating habits when writing the book-for example , how they could not throw food away .
`` She had a real fear of wasting food , '' said Coe .
Ziegelman remembered : `` She actually made people sick . ''
There was the wind bag incident .
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg 's , they and Coe drew out a dessert they had prepared at home : The plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch .
`` It is called Prune whip , '' said Ziegelman , adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name .
There was no whipped cream , only plums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Each one reluctantly dipped a spoon in the tough , brown goo .
Surprisingly , it did n't taste bad .
Coe picked up three times a repercussion .
Like a can-do Budgetierer , he said to his wife , `` a couple of chopped walnuts would help . ''

Accidents-bus slips into Krummhörn in ditch : eight injured
In an accident of a coach with 43 seniors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn ( Landkreis Aurich ) .
Two of the occupants suffered serious injuries , the police shared .
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to evade her data according to a vice , which was partly on the opposite road .
The bus came to the right off the road and slipped into a ditch , as a spokeswoman for the police Aurich/Wittmund reported .
`` Due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the coach independently , '' she said .
The fire brigade liberated the occupants .
Six ambulances and an ambulance car came to the accident scene on the State Road 2 .
The uninjured travellers were brought back from a bus to the crooked horns of Pewsum district .
There you should wait for a operating of the travel company .
The investigators called on the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .

Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. magistrate ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by it from the hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc .
In June , Gilead was exempted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the infringement of two patents by Merck , in connection with the Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead 's blockbuster drugs , after a US judge revealed a pattern of wrongdoing by Merck , including the perjury and other unethical acts .
When bringing the lawsuit on Thursday , U.S. Magistrate Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to waive the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Merck is trying to equate with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
The case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property on laboratory work , which Sofosbuvir based , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .

Police : 3 victims in serial killer case when listening to music in the car shot
According to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot , killed in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in the first serial killer case of Phoenix , while chatting in the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 , while the car was parked in a driveway , the authorities said .
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle that is read in the report .
The police said that the triple homicide did not seem to be the result of a robbery , as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims .
The police spokesman for Phoenix Sgt . Jonathan Howard said that the shootout led the investigators to take a closer look at whether she was connected with four previous attacks .
In total , in Hispanic residential areas , seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks within four months .
`` It happens in a residential area in front of a house , '' Howard shared the KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , at the beginning of the month .
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles , including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s , and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis ' daughter Maleah died on site .
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
The authorities also published a police report on the shootout , which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .

Scot Callum Skinner storms home when Brits get gold for cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men 's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own . The young made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while Hoy clinched the fifth of six Olympic gold .
They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the rail World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
They did this in time as Hindes showed up .
Hoys Retirement created a gap that Kian 'emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man they stayed in when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny-who won with Hoy four years ago and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round .
And the British trio won the duel with gold .
Hindes was barely back after his lap , but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it .
A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation , in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and to allow Kenny and , above all , Skinner to keep pace .
Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner , Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on the podium .
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said , `` It 's a flattering comparison . ''
I 'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
We set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions .
It was just amazing .
There is no better way to win this .
After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys , Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start .
He later withdrew this statement and there was no opposition from England 's rivals .
With such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time .
Hindes said : `` It feels with all the GB flags in the grandstand like London . ''
We 've been together as a team in the last three months .
We have come so badly from so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
This is an event , a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velodrome .
With the form Kennys it is in the realm of possible that he reiterates Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
That would be for Kenny-who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , which was also born on 23 March ( an apparently holy date for British sport ; The day also included Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister ) -a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the same for Hoy .
Kenny is next in the sprint , which starts today and will go on for three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said , `` I just enjoy this for the moment . ''
The team event is always best .
You can win it with your colleagues .
It feels a little lonely to win alone .
Hindes said , `` If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the knight . ''
It was the only medal contest of the day , but there was more good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race .
They arrived at the destination in 3:51,942 .
The world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3:51,659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) are held today on the second day of the Wettbewers , where Wiggins will certainly be in the spotlight .
He had argued with the Commissioner before the qualification yesterday , when he called him officials to measure his body size .
In the corresponding women 's competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , advanced Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in Weltrekordszeit in 4:13,260 .
The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a bevy of medals .
After a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dramas played out in the background , according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying accusations as well as retiring from greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
However , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome , it looks as if the now legendary call GBS , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .

The USA wins fourth match in the field of women 's hockey , a showdown with Britain is imminent
One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0 .
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement , but BAM ( 27 ) said she could n't remember ever doing that .
`` I have no idea . '' she said .
I do n't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
She knows , however : the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the British women in the first place , who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan .
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals , the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win the first and second place respectively .
The first-placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch in the direction of the other group .
However the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have caused a startling whirl through their success story , four years after they landed at the last of the 12 seats in the last London Games .
BAM was part of this team .
She grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years of playing a hockey bat in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University ) , at age 16 she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad .
Then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for you and your team .
The following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , coach of the national team , began to turn things up for the better .
`` A change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , '' said Bam .
We did not have the workload in London , which we now have .
We have been able to pull the rudder completely around .
On Thursday evening , BAM opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close range .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until BAM took the game into their hands .
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved into the middle and lupfte the ball into the gate to give the American in a 2-0 leadership .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the United States , Jackie Briggs , who had previously booked a goal in each of the previous games .
She 's got a run .
Just like Bam .
`` We are in a good position '' said Parnham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .

B27-Rehabilitation : restaurants suffering from blocking
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being rehabilitated .
For those responsible for the construction work , which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at around 8pm , there is praise everywhere .
`` They made it all pretty smart , '' says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station .
This is a superteam .
There is no delay either .
The construction site was scheduled to be moved south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
It is also praised for the people who are responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up makeshift driveways .
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists , the traffic situation within the village has relaxed .
The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides .
The Dodge traffic through the place seems to go back .
`` There were sometimes considerable complaints '' , says the deputy chief executive officer Florian King , who was responsible for the transport management of the renovation .
The residents of Bach 's street , Stone Laughing Street , Hafnerstraße and pond rain had to contend with more traffic noise , because many creeping paths were searching and more familiar to their navi than the signposting .
Which resulted in some trucks being frayed in residential areas .
Since the speed limits were not adhered to , the municipality also urged the measuring vehicle of Mössingen .
`` There were considerable transgressions , '' said King , who made himself aware of the situation on the spot .
Two to three per minute have been flashed .
The fastest was 77 hours in the speed 30 zone .
Since the construction site has moved on , it has become quieter .
For the business people at the B 27 , it is only a small consolation that the street is now open to customers from Rottenburg .
Business people do n't like to look into the cards .
But that the B 27 remediation has led to sales slumps , everyone who is asked can be looked through .
However , some are more and some are less affected .
Those who have less to do with the `` end customer '' , i.e . produced for other companies , for whom the renovation has hardly followed .
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a `` maximum slight decline '' at the Maier dealership , but also admits that `` the running clientele is missing '' .
The most heavily battered are the local along the road .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the Steak House , formerly crown , finds clear words .
This is already threatening existence .
Not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it `` hard '' .
Customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil were missing .
We must be happy about every euro turnover .
He quantifies the sales losses to `` well over 50 percent '' .
The rehabilitation of the roads had `` thrown back '' by two years .
He had to dismiss half of his employees .
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would have reacted differently .
Instead , government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the hint replied , the restaurant will benefit from the benefits of the location on the B 27 . Now , it must also bear the disadvantages that arise from the renovation .
Göhner knows of other counties , where such a thing was handled more generously .
In all complaints , Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
After all , the family business has been located here since 1715 , he refers to the long history .
He can understand that other regulars are now less likely to stop by because of the complicated traffic management .
If you ca n't go here , it 's nice to be somewhere else .
Göhner has no doubts that his regular clientele will come back after the end of the renovation work .
Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history .
Six months of construction work , that 's already brutal .

Ground in Double pack
In the recent meeting , the municipal council focused on topics related to construction .
With relief , the Panel adopted the communication of Mayor Robert Putz that `` finally the marketing of the recently designated housing areas can begin '' .
After the land , Parzellierungs and development issues have been clarified and the applications for surveying could be made , the sale of the land in the residential areas `` Straßlweg '' and `` Schönau-West '' ( Section 1 of Binder Road-expansion ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
The municipal council is convinced that the land in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau will appeal to young families and spry senior citizens alike .
As it was said , building volunteers can immediately report to the city Hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the parcels in its September meeting .
In order to be able to make inquiries about the settlement of further businesses , coupled with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan , which was newly created in the spring of this year , in sub-areas .
Thus , in the area of Unterzeitlarn , the already designated industrial area is extended by two parcels towards the state Road 2112 .

Rescue in Moelfre Bay : Three men have `` luck still to be alive ''
Three men have `` luck still to be alive '' after they were thrown from their fishing boat before Anglesey .
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST Alarm after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay .

Witnesses wanted : Beverage market in Waldbröl invaded
A robbery was perpetrated on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerber Road .
Under a firearm , three darkly clad persons who had masked their faces demanded the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW Golf .
How much money has been looted , the police do not share .
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters in size , so relatively small .
The beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Rewe market .
The perpetrators must have run after the robbery in the direction of Gerber Strasse , Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and have fled from the gravel car park in front of the car park entrance with the silver car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schladernring ) .
Those who have made observations about the time ( against 19.45 ) , who are in connection with the robbery , should urgently report to the police .

Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue .
Kendall , who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at fashion weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account .
`` In a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , '' wrote Kendall .
The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar ? ) , scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family ( with the exception of the problem cases rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) , as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends with a classic twist : they have all planned a surprise party .
This is the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children 's show ( Seacrest brought the sentence , `` You thought we 'd forgotten you ? , '' with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a square at 8 o'clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity .
With regard to the September issue of Vogue has certainly begun a new Era of Kardashians .
Kendall 's big sister Kim likes to have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned ( she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league by itself .
The September edition is the most sold edition of the Year for Vogue .
With a volume that is more like a picture-set than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertisers ( according to the fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Tome 615 page advertising ) .
The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years images of the magazine were leaking before the official announcement .
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In recent years were clearly more `` celebrities who model '' than `` models who are celebrities '' on the cover .
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady Gaga had the honor .
But even at the slight chance that Mrs Jenner-who is described by the magazine as the `` breakthrough model '' of her generation-falls under the former category , she is in good company .
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video ( even if it all applies to Jenner ) .
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of lemonade one of the most successful years of her career .
Of course , Jenner 's success does n't appeal to everyone .
With her reality TV story , Jenner 's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense .
In June , the former Victoria 's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her `` the pieces of the moment . ''
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the release of Jenners on the Vogue cover .
But riding around on the moroseness seems to pass by the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue .
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel .
She 's running for Marc Jacobs .
She 's advertising her primer , Estee Lauder .
You and all your sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall apps .
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to Love magazine .
And in her free time she is in reality TV . Presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children .

The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs , both located in Louisiana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend .
The meteorologists Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge .
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger , as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas via the rivers that have occurred .

Rescue teams still plucked people from the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and stepson were among those who were rescued on Friday near Gloster .
Hansford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rises overnight .
He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him .
`` We woke up and the water streamed and poured in , '' said Hansford .
It reached my waist .
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years in which she lived there , she had never seen such a high state of the river .
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim .
Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster , where they were housed until Friday .
Krautmann said that the flood had `` spread rapidly '' as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions would .

In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa , nearly two dozen roads were closed due to the floods and sandbags were provided for the residents to take away , hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
`` The last major flood that we had was in March , '' said Lacy Landrum of the city administration .
This seems to be a similar incident .
In Mississipp , the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said that it was still raining on the Gulf Coast .
According to his details , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been flooded , but none were reported on Friday .
Keith Townson , manager at shopper value Foods in Amite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
`` I 've seen water in places where I 've never seen it before , '' said Townson , `` and it 's still coming . ''

Case of sickness : when does the organizer pay
Sick holidaymakers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel .
This is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to exhibit the same symptoms .
In the negotiated case , a family on the second day of their Türkeiurlaubs was severely affected by diarrhea and vomiting .
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
Their illness caused the holidaymaker to return to a defective sewage treatment plant , which supposedly polluted the sea water .
The family felt that the trip had been deficient-and complained to the organizer .
The plaintiffs had no success in court .
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiff 's departure .
Until then , he had to assume that the sea water was in order .
He did not violate his information duties , he said .
Since no impurities have been found in the samples of the water .
The disease of several hotel guests-possibly due to contagion among themselves-belong to the general life risk .
Of 691 guests were only 38 ill .

Olympia 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught : Due to a positive doping test , weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio can not start .
Rio DE JANEIRO-The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases .
A caught athlete almost won a medal .
Before the seventh day of the competition , the first official doping cases became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil-immediately before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions , these news come to the untimely .
At Chen , the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide , which was used as a masking agent for doping substances , had already been proven last Sunday .
The International sports Court CAs confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
On Sunday the 18-year-old had occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen would have participated in the rounds over 50 m freestyle .
Chen has requested the opening of the B-probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
The National Association takes the matter `` very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations '' , Xinhua quoted from a communication : `` We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAs and will accept the verdict '' .
For the first time in history , the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases .
Also the night of Rio leaked the news about the positive sample at Danekowa , the 33-year-old went into the offensive .
`` I had three Tests , all negative , and my fourth Test was positive '' , this was `` an incredible shock , '' she told the Bulgarian TV channel BNT .
She was innocent , `` the only explanation could be dietary supplements , '' explained the athlete .
According to the report , the banned substance should be the blood doping agent EPO .
Danekowa was temporarily suspended , according to BNT , the B-sample should have been positive as well .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister , Boyko Borisov , immediately spoke to the athlete with criticism .
`` I do not understand why the sportsmen do not draw the right conclusions , '' he said : `` We Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been excluded '' .
For example , all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation must not participate in Rio .
On Friday the case `` Adrian Zielinski '' was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tomasz three days previously positive on the anabolic steroid nandrolone .
Both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
Before the start of the light athletes , the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
The IAAF World Association had banned the entire Russian team from launching , except for one exception due to systematic doping , even the runner nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
In the sport of swimming , the earlier mispasses in China had also caused fierce clashes between the athletes .
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly .
`` Sun Yang pees purple . ''
`` When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle , I want to surrender , '' said Lacourt on the French radio .
Sun was also at the heart of an engagement with Australian Mack Horton .
`` I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters , '' said this .
Sun had been tested positively for the stimulant Trimetazidin at the Chinese championships in 2014 , but only had to sit for a three-month ban .

Assistant doctors strike : demands for new industrial action
Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes regarding a new contract .
The Junior doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has asked its entire council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September .
The JDC said that minister failed would have to deal with the concerns about the treaty .
In July , assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA .
It was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
In a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained `` persistently calm '' to problems , which led to the treaty being rejected .
She said : `` In view of this , the JDC board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiation of all your worries . ''
In response to the silence of the government , the JDC board has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action that begins at the beginning of September .
The disputes led to the fact that assistant doctors were striking six times this year , the first overall failure in the history of the NHS .
The head of BMA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms that had been recommended by the BMA .
He shared BMA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
After the vote , Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced .

Russia 's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov was a part of Putin 's closest circle of trust for many years .
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters .
In an opinion of the Kremlin , it is that Putin , without giving any reason , `` ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration '' .
Anton Vaino , who has been Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , has been appointed as his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious state Moscow Institute for International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo .
On the Kremlin 's website it is said ( in Russian ) that he was later the chief of staff and head of government .
He said about his appointment to Putin , `` Thank you for your trust . ''
I think it is the government 's most important task to support its work as head of State regarding draft laws and controls to implement its instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
Are the smiling faces convincing ?
This step has made Moscow secret shrouded .
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin 's closest confidants for a long time and works like him for the Soviet Secret Service , the KGB .
As chief of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
At a meeting with President Putin , which was aired on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigned at his own request .
But despite the smiles for the cameras , few are convinced-especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
Nobody knows that at the moment .
But the official claim-that a man who was once touted as a potential president would like to lead the Russian environmental policy at once-was very sceptical .
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin 's website , Ivanov said , `` It is true that I asked her in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post-one could almost say-arduous post for four years .
As it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011 .
Previously , he was deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the KGB .
In the late 1990s , when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , which replaced the KGB , Ivanov was appointed as his deputy .
When Putin reached power , he named Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
It was once believed that after Putin 's second term , Ivanov could become president of Russia , as a third term Putin would have violated the constitution .
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later .

NASA climate model : Venus was once livable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once livable .
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
The model was designed to determine whether Venus , with its hot , waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere , could once have shown Earth-like conditions .
Scientists have previously suggest that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on .
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus .
The planet probably had more arid areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation .
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
`` In the GISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed their day-side of the sun for almost two months , '' explained Giss scientist Anthony del Genio in a press release .
This heats up the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun 's warmth .
The result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution that was previously suspected by planetary scientists .
Although it was once presumably habitable , Venus -- over several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by the ultraviolet light .
When their hydrogen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect was left behind -- the Venus that we know today .
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters .

One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivan .
Sounds rather cluttered , but the HR-V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
Although the only 1.60 m high hr-V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely at any point .
The materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasantly , only the cockpit top falls off .
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space .
There is not only a trunk of 453 l at raised and 1026 L with folded backs available , but there are the `` magic seats '' .
This is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a movie chair and thus offer storage space that is up to the ceiling 1.24 metres high .
The trunk can be loaded well , but the height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
The tested 1.6-L-diesel with 88 kw/120 HP speeds up the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 nm in wide speed ranges .
However , he should do his job a little more quietly .
The daily consumption of 4.7 L/100 km is pleasing .
There is another motorization : a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kw/130 hp .
A four-wheel drive is not offered .
The driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamism and comfort .
But the steering should be a little more direct .
The equipment in the tested top variant `` executive '' leaves nothing to be desired .
The security systems include the city-emergency assistant ( works up to Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the tracking assistant .
The collision detector sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as `` approaching objects '' when shunting .
The remote lighting Assistant works very reliably .
And the intelligent tempo control responds to the traffic signs detection and throttles , if required , the speed .
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7-inch touchscreen , Navi , app integration and more .
Two usb and one HDMI jacks are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach .
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine .
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros , the diesel from 23000 euros .
The engines meet the Euro 6 standard .
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday suitable car .

London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS , was reported to have died in Syria .
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned a few weeks ago of her death in Raqqah , Syria .
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqah , the stronghold of the group in the country , ITV News reported on Thursday .
Sultana was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she had decided to leave the war-stricken country and return to England .
`` One can only hope that this is the only good thing-as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone-to prevent people from ever taking this decision , '' said Akunjee .
In February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London stepped into a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultana 's family was told that she married an Isis fighter in Syria , and became a widow within a few months .

Then strike him with his knee in the groin and twist her , while the attacker curvess with pain , the weapon from his hands . Hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while you point the gun at him .
In the case of attackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar-move your body out of the firing line , grab the gun and twist it so the attacker ca n't shoot .

Donald Trump concedes `` daunting problems '' in election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative states , to lose their majority .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his electoral campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah .
A rare moment in which the usually cocky and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns , as correspondents reported .
After throwing 16 rivals from the race in their own Republican camp , the doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing .
`` We have huge problems in Utah , '' Trump told evangelical Christians that he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
Guilt was false reports of his candidacy , he resumed his well-known media scolding .
Republican strongholds Jiggle
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans .
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June , Trump and his competitor were the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , at par .
Other institutes see Trump in the front , but not at the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk .
In an interview by CNBC , Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton 's advance : `` Just as I have done so far . ''
And pushed afterwards : this will `` either be successful , or I will make a very very nice , long holiday '' .
He 's not doing anything other than telling the truth .
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Trump said .
Then I return to a very good way of life .
According to the press reports , the party Trump has threatened to withdraw funds to support its campaign , it should not be able to present better survey values .
Instead , the Republicans ' candidates for Congress would be more under their arms .

Olympia : Brazen fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya 's light athlete threatens to adversity after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
The International Olympic Committee informed that a disciplinary commission should be set up immediately to investigate the case .
A Kenyan official had informed that the former sprinter and today 's coach , John Anzrah , had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich .
This was reported to the team leader of Kenya by the doping inspectors .
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert its own investigations , a IAAF spokesman shared .
`` Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC , the IAAF will make an assessment , '' it said in an IAAF statement .
`` He ( Anzrah ) has gone to the doping control station and has issued himself as Ferguson Rotich , given the sample and signed it , '' declared Kenya 's Chief de mission Stephan Arap Soi .
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency .
Ferguson Rotich had become in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
Four days earlier , the Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games .
He is said to have informed the athletes of his country about the upcoming doping tests .
According to media reports , he was to be detained on his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation by the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences .
In announcing the IOC 's more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio Games , it was unusually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are particularly targeted .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system .
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
As a result , WADA Kenya took the list of countries whose anti-doping measures are in conformity with WADA 's rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
The country 's light athletes won most of the medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
In a series of ARD television reports , accusations have repeatedly been made that doping drugs are readily available in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound last requested a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired her in Russian athletics .

The right `` identitary movement '' is in the sights of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution .
According to several provincial offices , the constitutional activists in the Confederation have also put the group under observation .
`` We see the ' Identitarian movement ' as evidence of aspirations against the Liberal Democratic fundamental order , '' said the head of the German press agency , Hans-Georg Maaßen , of the Deutsche Presse-office in Berlin .
Thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are defamed in extremist ways .
That is why we are observing the movement now .
The `` Identitary movement '' is a group with French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
It is opposed to `` multicultural delusion '' , `` uncontrolled mass immigration '' and the `` loss of one 's own identity through alienation '' .
Constitutionalists in nine federal states-Bremen , Bavaria , Hesse , Berlin , Baden-Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia-are already observing the `` Identitarian '' .
Maaßen said his authority was in close coordination with the provincial offices in the decision .
`` Groups like the ' identitary movement ' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , '' said the chief of the Constitution .
In general , extremists try to address them with youth-just language , often with pop music .
This is what Islamists and right-wing extremists do .
This is not cooperative advertising for one 's own cause .
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally .
Young people are particularly susceptible to this .
That 's dangerous .
Lastly , there had been reports from several federal states on contacts of the `` Identitarian '' to AfD politicians .
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this .
For the protection of the Constitution , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at some point .
It depends on whether the respective party-in this case the AfD-by certain persons who are extremist , changes their target direction and becomes so extremist .
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
This is not recognizable .
In view of the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters , Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new Right-wing terrorism in this context .
But we have noticed in recent years that there can be terrorist structures on the right .
There was the group ' Old School Society ' or the ' distal group ' .
It may well be the case that further legal terrorist groups or microgroups are formed , which plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives .
However , a nationwide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable .
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Maaßen expressed concern about the fact that many attacks were made on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
That is the worrying .
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum seekers have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene .
`` So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who might have been politically indifferent or , for example , elected CDU , SPD or leftist , who have radicalizeded by right-wing extremist sentiment . ''

The fee per cubic metre of wastewater is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros ; For Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euro ( previously 2.26 euro ) and for Azendorf 3.64 euro ( previously 2.18 euro ) .
At the plant in Azendorf , the wastewater charge will increase once again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
After an approximate calculation , the wastewater price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre .
As Mayor Bernd Steins ( CSU ) reported , when approving the budget by the District Council of Kulmbach , it was found that these sewage plants were under cover .
The market Kasendorf is obligated to operate the plants in a cost-comprehensive and legal basis .
From 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse .
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel , a recalculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary .
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over-or under-coverings from the previous calculation period were also to be offset .
The serious increase in fees was justified by Schmidt 's fact that all three sewage plants were relatively small facilities with a very small wastewater attack , which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
For example , due to the low distribution base , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
In addition , the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining .
In addition , the previous calculation period for all three plants was not least due to their old-age renovation and repair expenses to a considerable extent .
The plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old , the plants for Welschenkahl , Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the sewage system Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
In the pumping Welschenkahl the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the pond sewage treatment plant Lopp had to be excavated after nearly 20 years of operation of the first Klärteich , the sewage sludge is disposed of and an additional ventilation facility can be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations .
Schmidt : `` These extraordinary expenses were attributable to the amortisation and maintenance costs , which have to be taken into account in the new calculation period . ''
The same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011/2012 .
Stone houses made it clear that in the small wastewater seizure in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance are `` fully penetrated '' .
In the process , Schmidt added that the market community had been spared from large-scale entertainment costs in wastewater treatment facilities over the past 20 years .
According to stone houses , the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain precarious in the long term , especially since it is not possible to extend the supply area of the sewage Zweckverbandes Frisian Brook around these plants because they are deficit facilities .

Police put tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
The police put tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators .
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students , which caused the police to put on rubber bullets and tear gas .
Several hundred students attended the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans .
According to the proposals of the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money .
Some of the protest participants saw graffitits against the provisional President Michel Temer spraying on walls .
The most recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to Mass on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .

RESTful night : Tips for sleeping disorders
In the evening you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , and in the morning it is already far before the then to think of sleep .
This is anything but restful .
After all , one is with such problems in good company : According to the Robert Koch Institute has about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
There are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can be based on a variety of causes , stresses Hans-Günter Weeß , board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and sleep medicine .
What one understands by land , however , is the insomnia , i.e . a sleep disorder .
In particular , many people feel that sleep is unsatisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagonman , member of the Board of the German House association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel .
What is behind insomnia ?
The causes of sleep disturbances are complex .
This may include organic , psychological or behavioral factors , but also medications .
Often the sleep disorder is the expression of another disorder .
`` Waking up very early is particularly common in a depression , '' says Weeß .
And it may be that different factors cause each other .
Those who have a herniated disc , for example , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours , and may start brooding over everyday problems and worries , Weeß gives an example .
This leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
When should you go to a doctor with insomnia ?
Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are impaired during the day should go to the doctor , advises Weeß .
The impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , tired , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is slightly irritable , has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
To alleviate the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
Treatment options include , among other things , behavioural changes , cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications-classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
In Germany , there are hardly any sleep physicians in the country , stresses Prof. Ingo Fan , head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center of the Charité University medicine Berlin .
Therefore , in case of sleep problems you should first contact the family doctor , advises Weeß .
This can be investigated to determine whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should go to the sleep lab , and what happens ?
For examination in the Sleep laboratory , for example , doctors advise on snoring with breathing dropouts , in case of morbid daytime fatigue , in sleep transformers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder , explains fan .
You do n't really have to prepare for the investigation .
You should spend your day normally .
`` Only please do n't make a nap , '' says fan .
After wiring , you go to bed at its normal time .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , you wear a pair of nose glasses , a chest strap and a finger sensor .
In addition , a camera on the ceiling draws the sleeping end .
How can affected people handle the problems ?
There are quite a few set screws on which you can fix for a better sleep .
Weeß counts on : regular sleep and rise times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to fall asleep , avoid alcohol and do not watch at night-then you start to expect immediately , and that is not conducive at all .

Cats respond more sensitively than hangovers on cries of young
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals .
To her surprise , the meowing also caused the males not to be cold-however , in contrast to the females they always behaved the same .
Female cats can recognize the level of arousal of cat babies at the meowing of the little ones .
They react by ten percent faster to the lute of kittens , who feel in great distress , as scientists have found out from the veterinary college and the medical School Hannover ( MHH ) .
Tomcats also react to the calls of kittens-but always the same .
`` Apparently the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not perceptible or not significant , '' said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH .
She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the `` BMC Evolutionary Biology '' magazine .
In a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries differed with the urgency of their need for help .
A total of nine adult hangovers and eight females from the animal husbandry of the mhh were observed .
They were played on a call of little ones , who were taken out of the litterbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings .
On the other , they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens who were additionally lifted .
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample .
`` All the females , even those who have not had their own offspring , reacted in a differentiated manner to the cries , '' said Konerding .
They turned faster to the loudspeaker when this call of the more excited kittens played .
This ability may be inbred or develop with sexual maturity .
`` One surprise was that the males reacted at all , '' said the biologist .
In the past , scientists have been investigating the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans .
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants , whether they were mothers or not , reported the biologist Marina Sage .

Podolski takes `` gala '' to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey .
In Turkey , a warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
For the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will take place in Turkey .
Before the duel of the arch between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : `` Business as usual '' is announced .
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the overthrow in July , the Government affirmed that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected .
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , which is blamed for the coup attempt .
It does not stop there before football .
Against the former star kicker Hakan Sükür , the prosecutor made a warrant .
Thus , the Sükür now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sükür is to be followers of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
Although the state of emergency , which was initially imposed for 90 days , still applies until October , in fact it has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks .
The nightly `` Democracy guards '' in public places across the country have declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday .
The sport is-like the whole country-divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan .
Especially fans of the workers club Besiktas do not traditionally count among the friends of the President .
What unites the majority of Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military coups .
Even the fans agree-no matter if your heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas .
At the Cup Winner `` Gala '' it will be especially on Lukas Podolski arrive again .
The Cologne proved its sporting value in the past season : with 17 goals and nine originals in all competitions , the 31-year-old finished his first season as top of his club .
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1:0 victory .
The newspaper `` Fanatik '' cheered him : `` He was the best on the pitch . ''
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team .
Thanks to `` Poldi '' , the disappointing season for the record Master was a conciliatory conclusion .
After the preliminary round-K. O In the Champions League , the `` Lions '' also distinguished in the European League early .
In the Süper League , it was only enough to rank six .
The season was not good .
The trophy was the only way to win something .
`` We have done that and that is the most important thing , '' said Podolski .
For master Besiktas the year was better .
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez , who , with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig top scorer , laid the basis for the 14th title .
That is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old .
In the process , the one contracted by the AC Florence and rented to Besiktas only Gomez after the coup attempt announced that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his em-holiday .
`` If Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it '' , the magazine `` kicker '' quoted Clubchef Fikret Orman .
However , the striker would have to be willing to forgo about one third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros , Orman clarified : `` We can not pay his salary at Florence '' .

Condoms with chili powder , fireworks promote Tanzania 's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into people-inhabited settlements-they throw condoms on them that are filled with chili powder .
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation , who had the idea years ago , together with the US nature conservation , has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals .
Previously , many Spears used to defend themselves .
Friday is world Elefantentag dedicated to animal welfare .
`` Ever since we ... Toolkit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without damaging the elephant , `` said the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication .
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing it into a horn .
If he is not deterred , a so-called `` chili Cloud '' is thrown .
Chili powder mixed with Earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom , the end of which is turned up onto the ignition cord .
When it is lit , the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air .
A breath right usually already out to chase the elephant .
One last option is a launcher that shoots a gold rain fireworks in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass exodus
`` Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan , sits on packed suitcases , '' says the chairman of the Gülen-near foundation dialogue and World , Edwin Karakoyun .
The Kurdish community of Germany expects in the short term with tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term , it could even become `` a few hundred thousand '' , believes the association chairman Ali Toprak .
Due to the harsh approach of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass exodus to Germany .
`` In the short term , I reckon with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , '' says the association chairman Ali Toprak of the `` world '' of Friday .
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago , 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey .
After the thwarted coup , secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would still be added .
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey .
`` It can not be that a state that is self-absorbing refugees produces refugees in their own country , '' said Toprak .
The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Alevi cities .
This is what Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave .
`` They are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years , '' said Toprak , who is also a CDU member .
The head of the association called for the Federal government to `` position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its followers '' .
A `` witch hunt '' against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany .
I am not feeling safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
The branding as a Gülen pendant destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics .
`` Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan , sits on packed suitcases , by the way also the kemaists and secular , '' said Edwin Karakoyun , chairman of the Gülen-near foundation dialogue and education , the `` world '' .
As reported by the newspaper citing figures from the Federal Ministry , the Turks , before the coup , presented the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised in Germany for political persecution .
By the deadline of 30 June , this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as entitled to Asylum ( 39,625 ) .
In this survey , there is no escaping from war , poverty or hopelessness .
The right to asylum according to the Basic Law is exclusively political , i.e . from the state side , individually persecuted .

Once displaced over the price of the market , café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay for a bar that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
Of course , was ousted by the prices from his Bedford Avenue storefront .
The business soap Cherie , which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cupcakes .
Locals mourned it as a last loss in a Gentrifizierenden city .
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , `` I know New York is changing , but I still ca n't believe that CBGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and is now a soap shop . ''
But if New York is a change , it is also a reinvention .
A revived Verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint , less than a mile north of its original location .
The new verb has wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
The coffee is still good .
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a long-time employee of the Old café , who is the owner and managing director of the New Café .
He started working at verbs in 2001 and remained there until the end .
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outpost , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , maintained a lot of things .
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment .
He introduced new ingredients .
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are trimmings such as capers and sautéed onions .
There are natural rice bowls .
The café does not serve any beer , but there are fresh juices .
After nine months , Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
`` Many old customers were also ousted by prices from Williamsburg , '' he said .
Recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint , she would take the road .
After the verb had closed , she gave up drinking coffee for a while , she said .
`` I realized that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , '' she said .
Now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a blended chai tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Rosenthal has been a further longtime and loyal customer .
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing .
`` I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my everything-bagel with butter , '' he said .
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his everything-bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he had no grudge that the soap business had taken over the old business premises .
In fact , the owners of soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the coffee brewed in the café as an ingredient .
`` I think we 're going to go into your offer , '' said Rodriguez .
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café .
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to show them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
The location also has other advantages .
A local Saftlokal wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee .
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building .
For many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the café closed .
When the new café opened , Whitt said that entering the premises and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming .
`` I had to smell that , '' he said .

Municipal law centres have 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the Hilfsbedürfigsten of the country are dismissed annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is looking at the effects of further budget cuts on already overloaded transactions .
In Queensland , three out of five people – mostly older persons , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust eviction and the like – are already dismissed in their application for free legal advice and legal assistance .
Legal services of the municipality , which are already over-utilized , are ready for further cuts .
From June next year , it is foreseen that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
The director of the Gemeindrechtszentren of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centers revealed that thousands of people are already dismissed every year .
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a resolution of the federal government .
`` Queensland 's Community law centers are chronically underfunded , which means that thousands of people are dismissed from important services they need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relationships people with unmanageable and oppressive debts , families going through separations , workers who have been unfairly dismissed -- all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they ca n't get the help they need .
The federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of hilsbedürftigeren people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
We call on the general attorney and federal designated , as well as senators from Queensland George Brandis , to lift these funds immediately , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
Last year , the state Government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
It is now time to look at the needs of Community law centres and their customer communities , and that the government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work .

Woman in presumed suicide on Swiss highway run over
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
The police call witnesses after a woman was run over in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight .
A woman put herself in the dark `` in an act of despair '' on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vaud .
It is obvious that a Swiss , at the age of 49 years , who was run over by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill herself .
She died on the ground .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , who ask them and any witness of the incident to report .
A preliminary investigation was opened , which is a `` logical '' step in such a situation , shared Gilles Hofstetter with the Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
Was a collision avoidable ?
This is something the prosecutor must decide , `` said Hofstetter .
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable .
In each of the two cases-in which a person ran in the dark on the highway-it was decided that the motorists would not have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night runs on the highway , as was said in the newspaper .
Last year , a police officer of the negligent killing was acquitted after she had run over and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Payerne .
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , heard the court .
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency -- drove in a justifiable way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a `` perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation , '' said the judge .
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .

Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash , Cornwall .
After being forcibly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state .
The walls showed gaping holes , wooden planks were torn open , rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls .
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy , who works for the House administration at Cornwall Housing , said that she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired .
She said , `` It was an absolute nightmare for the people here , and I think people do n't have to live that way .
There are many things to consider , as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall .
The family is notorious and their reputation is also .
The couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats , intimidating residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive shouting , arguing , and swearing .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was given an order for anti-social behaviour in June .
In some rooms of the house , which may be demolished , old rubbish was found
The wooden planks were torn up in the estate where drugs were traded in the past .
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly by the police
Cornwall Housing Delogierte You and your partner forcibly this week from the property after giving you an extended period of 11 weeks to undress voluntarily .
The Delogierung were cheered by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were turned into hell .
One of them said , `` They did n't care about anyone . ''
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
`` We could n't sleep this morning . ''
We stood up because it was so quiet here-we are not used to it !
Now that you are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , neighbourhood enforcement manager of Cornwall Housing , said that the failed family would have to cooperate with local authorities .
The family lived in the house to which the police were summoned on a regular basis for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the municipal house , trash and old toys were thrown down
He added : `` It is a shame that the tenant neglected to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , since a Delogierung is always the last step that Cornwall housing considers .
This was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terribly brother for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Cornwall , as well as members of the community who have been courageously approaching us and who have provided us with the information , have done so .
I hope that this development will give consolation to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Delogierung on the floor
Workers of the House administration will now have to mountains to clear out the house surrounding
In 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales , Paraphernalien and cash in the amount of £1,700 .
Skeldon received a fine after being guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial intent .
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon , who was killed in a car accident in 2013 .
After they were without shelter , it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti .
The police say that they will be tenants who do not abide by the House Rules
Angela Crow of the police of Devon and Cornwall said that the Delogierung was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not abide by the House rules .
`` This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproaches as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour , '' she said .
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

Steel-light view for German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of dollars .
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the promotion of green electricity are off the table .
It remains in the liberation from the renewable energy distribution at the existing plants for the so-called own-electricity production in the German steel industry , said federal minister of Industry Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the `` West German General newspaper '' ( Waz , Friday edition ) .
`` I am really pleased that we have finally been able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . ''
The European Commission , therefore , had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
According to the German Industry association , the steel industry was threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills will an EEG-deposit of 20 percent be used .
But this is also not being raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany 's unification with the European Commission for the generation of own electricity .
In this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely enshrined .
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry were of particular importance .
`` With regard to our ' steel is Future ' campaign , this is a first step . ''
`` More must follow . ''
`` Climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emissions trading , '' said IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
Last year , the situation intensified as the world 's largest producer country , China , threw mass steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand .
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping .
In the course of this spring the situation has eased somewhat .
On the one , import duties imposed on imported steel have an effect , and the economic outlook in China has brightened .
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
The German industry Primus ThyssenKrupp remained cautious on Thursday .
Lastly , prices were again rather stagnant .
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Last but not least , ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
In the German steel industry , around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
In July , the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
With 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less steel than in the same month of the previous year as the Steel Industry Association on Friday .
After a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back the second month in a row .
Since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the prior-year figure .
In the coming months , the Association anticipates an increase in output due to an improved order situation .

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : `` Go where it Hurts ''
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign-and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the Landtag .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern you have understood .
In 2021 , the Landtag election will not be held again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
It 's no more stupid than it is : summer holidays , heat and Landtag election campaign-this is biting .
The locals who are to be persuaded by the election campaigners are on vacation .
The majority of holidaymakers in the country , on Usedom , Rügen or Hiddensee , are not locals , so they must not choose the Landtag .
In addition , there are practical problems : during the holidays , helpers hanging posters , blowing up balloons , distributing flyers and counting votes in the end are only laboriously encouraged .
Until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , once again , has to pass a election campaign close to the people .
The hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
And it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Celery , leader of an SPD/CDU coalition , must fear for his office .
The SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU in polls .
Exciting is how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what is left in the end of a coalition fit .
Sellering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost inconspicuous campaign , one sees from his large posters .
He travels through the country , spreads roses and chats a little with the people , just as his legendary word-sparse predecessor Harald Ringstorff did .
Otherwise , Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for blooming the AfD .
Their refugee policy , their `` we create this '' has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists , which is now presumably going to cost him the beautiful office .
The CDU with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier , has already experienced what it is like to make a campaign at the wrong time in the right place .
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies ; Merkel 's Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast .
But the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine-Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
`` There was probably the majority in other federal states , '' Vincent Kokert , general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , recently denounced the NDR .
But it is also too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
Otherwise , the northeast CDU largely renounces the usual electoral stands on market squares and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons .
This , says Kokert , only plays a `` subordinate role '' .
The Union also noticed that in the country you wegbröselt the base , that it must exert itself very hard to find another wire to the people .
It is like the left , the SPD , the Greens : scarcely present in the vastness of the country .
The Council of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his comrades , however , is also self-revealing : `` You must go where it hurts , namely where people are : festivals , golden Weddings , every birthday party must be used '' .
Because much is at stake , selling his SPD has now called for a particularly committed election campaign .
In polls , the Social Democrats were last 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and only just before the AfD ( 19 ) .
In the 2011 election , the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , small party with seven percent in the polls , are likely to make the leap into the Landtag .
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-not and set their election campaign largely on the internet .
`` Online election campaign '' , calls it the country 's chairman Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green election fighters are looking for local voters to search for the locals .
Silke Gajek , the top candidate , curves just with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and still finds it beautiful .
Her impression : `` Election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment '' .

Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly : `` It Gets Better ''
Like most 6-year-olds , Edmund Picciuto loves singing , playing toys and of course his mother .
But like the fewest of his Altergenossen , Edmund Microcephaly has the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know about during her pregnancy .
When he came home for the first time , my first thought was that I could n't manage .
I ca n't do this .
I did n't get into that .
Which is not true at all -- of course you have to be prepared , `` she said .
Her husband Vincent and her has been told that Edmund may never recognize them and that he may not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it .
`` My first answer was ' I did n't know that people were still doing , ' '' explained Picciuto .
Edmund can run with the help of a walker .
Edmund could not sit and crawl until his third year of his life , and he still can not speak .
But he 's slowly making progress .
He can run with support and ride a bike .
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has devised for `` Please Sing Me Something '' .
`` We teach him sign language , '' Picciuto told CBS News .
But it 's not a typical sign language -- she says . Edmund invented some signs on his own .
Microcephaly has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund , as well as infections with viruses such as measles or Zikavirus during pregnancy .
The symptoms and predictions can vary greatly .
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zikavirus .
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked constantly , what will happen ?
What will happen ?
And she still does n't really know .
I have not asked for a long time after the prognosis , because I do not expect someone to really be able to tell me .
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus .
It 's getting better .
You know that it will be better for you .
You will love your child and your child will love her .

GfK leadership takes off after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its chief Matthias Hartmann .
The resignations came suddenly-but not surprisingly .
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggests that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more unsure , the longer the successes he promises .
Turbulence at the forefront of the Nuremberg market research company GfK : After disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management , the world 's number five in the industry is facing a new beginning .
GfK Executive Board chairman wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory board , Arno Mahlert , has already resigned from the supervisory board with effect from 12 September .
As early as September 1 , the Management board member Gerhard Hausruckinger , the company , has already taken over the leadership .
He should officially assume the function of a `` board spokesman '' until a successor to Hartmann is found .
As a reason for the resignations , the company called `` different views '' on the long-term business policy orientation .
Details did not want to call a company spokesman on Friday .
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear at the moment .
In the case of investors , it was said on Friday that the shareholders had recently been disappointed with the continuing success of the restructuring initiated years ago .
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of GfK since 2011 .
`` The fruits of the restructuring are still not visible after 5 years , '' it said .
Given the recent poor GfK business figures , each shareholder will eventually become restless .
`` If that were the case with BMW , that would also make the Quandts so , '' it said .
After setbacks in the previous quarters , the company had not been able to stop its loss-taking in the second quarter of 2016 .
At 361.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year .
In relation to the first half of the year , sales shrank by 3.4 percent , with 721.2 million euros .
Profit in the second quarter was mainly due to the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
The goodwill amortization of 139 million euros , which was necessary in the Consumer experience business unit , gave the group a loss of 148.2 million euros .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GfK still generated a net profit of 19.7 million .

Which is why we need Simone , Gabby , and Laurie
This is what I me women Olympic team in gymnastics to introduce , and for more than one reason .
First of all , I 'm in it since 1984 , each summer Olympics and the United States were never so dominant .
And secondly : This team has three gymnasts , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren `` Laurie '' Hernandez , who worked for many young girls of color inspiring .
The structure of this team , Aly Raisman , who is Jewish , and Madison Kocian , who is Catholic , rounding , makes everyone proud .
This team reflects , finally , the United States .
It is black and Hispanic has solidified ash female presence at the top of this sport .
In the last four years , the number one was under the female gymnasts an African-American .
Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 .
The shows strength .
At the last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was cheered a surprising Olympic medallist and America .
Now , the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion , Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez , as you unexpected , however , masterful gymastik routines provided .
On Thursday , Simone was the fourth , heterosexual American , who won an individual more fight event for women Gold .
Team member Aly Raisman won the silver .
We experience the top of these sports , but gymnastics does not see classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gabby , and Laurie were all in the same way as Aly and Madison , to make it to the Olympic Team .
They are the `` Final Five '' , because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team . In addition , this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer .
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive Sport , and Turner , primarily in private gymnastics clubs that are obtained from parents for the training , equipment , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the Trainer and the gymnasts and families ) . The list can go on and on .
The majority of these gym clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
In these Clubs , the gymnasts received their entire Training , and this is for the families of an expensive and long-term commitment .
Aimee Boorman , coach of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , trainer of Laurie Hernandez , both have trained their athletes since she started with gymnastics .
We need to allow the municipalities to do so on countless young girls , inspired by Simone , Gabby , and Laurie , a leistbareres and easier to understand turn training .
I founded my turn Foundation of 20 years .
At my events , we have trained free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and Hispanic ) and national and international winners .
In September , we will be expanding to Detroit ( my home town ) , to offer youth high-quality gymnastics , deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports , and to benefit .
Gymnastics develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline , and determination for the spirit .
This combination offers life long health benefits , as well as for academic and professional success .
It is the Inspiration of this team , which will bring thousands of young girls are interested in gymnastics , and that 's great .
It is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
This is such an exciting time .
Thank you Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby , and Madison for this real representation of `` Girl Power '' by bringing the Olympic Mannschaftsgolds and thank you , barrel , you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds , to start your path to be healthy , strong and successful young women .

Pokémon Go , a hunting after health and happiness , is worth it
It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
That a Teenager and child to Play and not go outside , but rather , prefer to spend their free time on screens to stare at , it was complained in the last decade by many .
In Pokemon Go to get people off the Sofa and active .
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games , and most recently on Smartphones .
Therefore , it is not great to see that technology and activities to exclude Outdoor each other .
I refer of course to the Pokémon Go-delusion , an App based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( and later a cartoon series , game cards , and other Spin-Offs ) .
How many phenomena of popular culture decreased , the interest prior to the release of the game in the United States , Australia and new Zealand at the beginning of July something .
The market introduction in other countries has been postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the Server .
Within a few days pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short the player is told to go with their Smartphones out and are looking for Pokémons that will be followed with a GPS tracked and , once they have been found , `` photographed '' ( can be taken via a Screenshot on the phone ) or `` caught '' .
A Generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the craze and jumped for the search of your Sofa .
In the USA the game has led to a considerable increase in steps the `` average '' Person puts in every day .
Cardiogram , an App for Apple Watch , which follows 35.000 users post , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of post people who train every day for 30 minutes , followed by 45 percent to 53 percent started .
The company does not know who plays of Pokémon Go - it only provides the raw data to increase performance .
Many public awareness campaigns for health , the people want to take `` 30 minutes , '' `` come from the Sofa '' and `` to be active every day '' fell on deaf ears , because many of the public messages on health are boring , and people come , the misery of appearance .
Nevertheless , the importance of sports can not be overstated .
Those who exercised regularly , reduced their chances of developing cancer or depression .
Physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , Diabetes and a long list of benefits is too long to cite here .
But the wonder is full to Pokémon Go , that it brings the people to do something Outdoors that is fun .
Thus , the three pillars of health are exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people close to hunting and even new friendships .
As always , there are also grumpy party-pooper , who must always complain about something .
And Yes , someone could run against a door .
What 's the point ?
It has been a breakthrough .
Even if Smartphone Apps such as Fitbit already track our activity , they gave us no reason to go in for sports , as it does in this game .
The New one will lose its appeal and the use will abate with time .
Because of Pokemons success , but there will be more games , Apps and virtual reality with the active associations in the real world , and many people on the hunt will help you to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Grönlandhai : The oldest Vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare Sight .
Grönlandhaie come mostly in Winter to the surface .
This shark was allowed to return after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna into the sea .
He was born in 1624 , and swim with a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grönlandhaie get only 150 years young .
Leisurely the Grönlandhai floats at the bottom of the North Atlantic , along , in an hour , he comes in an average of 1,220 meters .
Only if it comes down to it , it accelerates the five-Meter-long animal to a whopping 2.6 km/h and this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal .
This slowness embossed living style seems to be a recipe for a ripe old age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal `` Science '' in any case , from a Grönlandhai that could be 392 years old .
`` Madness , '' says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life-span , the means for Vertebrates a world record .
Although the evolution is suspected , a biologist for a long time that Grönlandhaie be as old as the hills .
Only the evidence was lacking .
Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe , finally , they live mainly in the Arctic ocean in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because water temperatures prefer to six degrees Celsius , at the surface usually only in the Winter .
About the life style of the Grönlandhaie researchers know correspondingly little .
Their slow pace , they measured , as they provided prior to Spitsbergen six animals with a transmitter equipment .
Prey of these sharks still In the stomach of an animal , researchers found the Remains of a seal , another had taken the jawbone of a young polar bear .
You may hunt sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the Arctic ocean and search for carcasses , the stagger from the higher water layers to the bottom .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönlandhaie , the Fischer between 2010 and 2013 , in front of Greenland , or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic , it was picked up .
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long , while the largest 502 centimeters in dimension .
In order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks .
This is the center of the lens of the eye develops before birth , the sharks , the proteins are not renewed .
The two smallest sharks were striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core .
Your birth should be , therefore , to the early 1960s , when nuclear tests threw large quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
In the 220 centimetres , the length of the third smallest Tier of the lens nucleus contained a small Excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests , it is expected at the time of his examination in 2012 , his 50 . Celebrated the birthday .
All of the major Grönlandhaie had in your lens core , by contrast , the normal carbon-14-quantities produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
In fact , the carbon-14 clock showed a 493 centimetre long Grönlandhai an age of 335 years , during the record-breaking shark is likely to be 502 centimeters even be 392 years old .
That Grönlandhai-females can have offspring , if they are longer than four metres , was known .
Now , researchers at the length were able to assign an age .
As one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably on the threshold of sexual maturity , and his age was determined to be 156 years , Grönlandhaie with the propagation seem to be at least one and a half centuries of time .
Also for vertebrates is currently the world record .
Such Methusaleme life , especially in icy waters , is no coincidence .
The previous record holder , a 211 year-old bowhead whale , in the Speck on the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon tip was in , was caught off the coast of Alaska .
Due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there on the back burner to be running frequently .
They Mature later and age slower .
In order to keep in the cold water is warm , the animals are also often very large .
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal heat is losing .
The heat loss from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant .
Another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
`` A smaller animal is so hazardous , and should focus on , to have as early as possible as many as possible offspring , '' explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein .
A very large animal should invest its resources more in a long life .

Frankfurt benefits from a Brexit
The city on the Main has , therefore , in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg have the best chances , from London shifted to the jobs and companies to attract .
`` It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote '' , says Michael Voigtländer , head of the Compared to financial markets and real estate markets in the IW .
After the Brexit Referendum , it is uncertain whether financial institutions may continue to operate from London 's financial transactions in the whole of the EU .
For the so-called EU passport for the marketing authorisation in the UK , enough for you so far .
The use of large US banks .
Several banks have already announced plans to relocate Jobs .

For Frankfurt , the IW , speak of the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and prudential supervision of the largest banks in the Euro zone , United , and other important authorities such as the European insurance Supervisory authority EIOPA and the Risikorats ESRB .
In Paris , the Organisation for economic co-operation and development ( OECD ) , its headquarters have , however , this was for the financial industry is less significant than the ECB .
`` The proximity to the Central Bank is important for banks , since they can communicate directly with the supervision , '' says IW-Professor Voigtländer .
Luxembourg beheimate a large Fund industry , cutting edge however , as well as Dublin in the infrastructure poor .
Frankfurt was reached thanks to the large airport much easier .
Furthermore , points of the city with easily available commercial real estate .

Even if quality of life is a question of preferences : `` With its already strong Position as a financial location for the single European market Frankfurt , may attract more banks and investors , '' concludes the IW .

Escape : `` Any refugee woman has experienced sexual violence ''
Sexual violence is for women who flee alone , almost everyday .
When you arrive in Germany , they are often traumatized .
A house provides shelter .
In a large kitchen , four women sit .
Each of them has a Baby that is not more than a year old .
A laid her little son in the Arm .
He looks with big eyes curious in the room .
His mother is staring at the tabletop .
Until she realizes that she is observed .
She smiles briefly and kisses the Little one .
The scene is normal .
Until we speak with Katrin Bahr .
She is area Director of Condrobs , institution for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
The four women in the kitchen are Refugees .
You live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation for all Inge escaped women and their children in Bavaria .
In January Condrobs has opened the facility together with Pro Familia , and the Munich-based woman help .
Recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - approximately 40 women and 20 children .
Men , there is none - not even as a visitor .
The exception is a security guard in front of the door .
`` It is no exaggeration to say that Every woman that comes here , has made it on their flight experiences with sexual violence , '' says Bahr .
`` Men flee because of Wars , because they are politically persecuted , because of torture , or the death , or because their families send hope to Europe , '' she says .
In women , other reasons for the escape outweigh that : `` Many steal secretly away , because they see no other way out '' .
In their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced made prostitution .
You continue driving .
On the run , the list goes on .
`` That tractor demand , for example , for a bottle of water , a sexual act , is not uncommon , '' says Bahr .
And the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
Those who believe that the end , once you come and ask in Germany , is misleading , says Bahr .
Here , too , single women in refugee would accommodation , often considered inferior and , at worst , abused .
The result is that about 90 percent of women living in accommodation in the North of Munich , are traumatized , and appreciates you .
`` Some of the kids are certainly not created voluntarily . ''
Many women are so used , that they say nothing .
`` Or you do not dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great '' .
Since you do n't know help often , need it more accommodations just for you , calls for Bahr .
In Bavaria , the seven district governments for the accommodation of refugees , in charge .
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project in Munich in the area of its competence , the answers some .
In the upper Palatinate and upper Franconia , about there is no such thing in accommodation of the governments .
Also in Swabia alone , refugee women are housed separately , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , press Secretary of the government .
In upper Bavaria , and middle Franconia , there are some community accommodation floors or own-houses for single women and their children .
The exception is Bavaria , there are two Central properties exclusively for women .
Also , the Committee `` women 's rights and gender equality '' in the European Parliament demands that women must be segregated from men , are housed .
In a study published for the Committee , said : `` It 's very important that men and women are separated houses . ''
`` The lack of privacy , or men and women be housed together , it can - the continuous violence against women '' .
Especially , the washing should be separated , and for women , shall be easily accessible , in the study .
How the women feel this need to protect , you can read the crowd on the house in Munich .
`` Since around spoke , that it gives us , we have a long waiting list , '' says Bahr .
You could easily open a second house .

Still , Volkswagen comes through lightly .
Despite the diesel scandal , the delivery increase in the world .
But not in all markets , it runs smoothly .
In the case of the recall , there are vertebrae to a term .
Volkswagen will start deliveries of subdued in the second half of the year .
Europe 's largest car manufacturer has so far this year despite the diesel affair , thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets is a Plus .
But in July , the core was marked by a brand of VW , especially in Western Europe , and weighed so that the total sale , as announced by companies listed on the Dax .
Worldwide , the VW brand sold in July with 449100 cars , 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month last year .
In Western Europe alone , according to China , the second-most important market , sales were 14 percent below the same month last year .
In the home market of Germany , deliveries went down in almost one-sixth .
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker Numbers from July , mainly due to two fewer selling days in Europe .
In addition , in some core markets due to `` changed economic conditions '' a reluctance to purchase .
In addition to the Situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote had not been burdened with the country 's exit from the EU , explained a spokeswoman .
In the USA , where the exhaust gas affair escalated first , is also more of a Minus to the book .
Great support for VW in the Chinese market .
Overall , the mainly concerned is the house brand of lower Saxony , is already more lightly by the diesel scandal : After the first seven months , only a Delivery decrease of 0.9 per cent , stands at 3.37 million vehicles to book .
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to show from January to July , Sales increase .
1.3 per cent more vehicles Volkswagen delivered in this time , in the world 5,904 million .
Volkswagen had manipulated with a Software , exhaust-gas tests .
In Germany alone , the VW gets around 2.5 million cars for conversion in the workshops .
In the course of the conversion , VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
After the conversion , the vehicles in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , no deterioration .
The car maker is not the customers after the conversion , a `` guarantee '' certificate , but speaking of a `` warranty '' as it was called on Friday in business circles .
Basic legal intricacies .
The `` Focus '' had reported , Volkswagen will grant its German customers now , but a warranty for reconditioned diesel models .
This was confirmed last Monday , VW 's representative in the Federal Ministry of transport .
From the Ministry of transport , it was confirmed that there was this Meeting .
`` VW has to meet the requirements of my inquiry Commission of the KBA in full . ''
`` The deviations are not acceptable , '' said German transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , according to the Ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion , no deteriorations are taking place all type approval relevant vehicle values unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term `` warranty '' but , as it was called in business circles .
In the case of the broad term `` warranty '' looks to be a Volkswagen , the possibility that customers may come , for example , half a year after the conversion , for example , with a damage to the engine in a workshop - and this could lead back to the new Software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
Also in the customers interest , it is important to avoid that it comes in the case of any other damages that have nothing to do with the exhaust of the scandal , to uncertainty regarding the possible warranty provisions , as it was called .
That 's why VW do n't use the term `` warranty '' .

Queensferry Crossing : a bridge associated with Fife
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by may 2017
Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife .
It is the first of four welds of the `` deck blower '' , the approach of the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long , and weighs 30,000 tons .
He has over 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 inclined in a hurry .
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by may 2017 .
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site a visit today and was one of the First that went from the country up to the bridge .
He said : `` This is an historic and symbolic Moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings .
We are all witnesses of an art of engineering from a truly epic dimensions in this project , with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were alone used for that part of the bridge .
In spite of the massive size and weight of the bridge , is the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity , which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
A total of 79 % of the total bridge decks are almost in place , and the last section of the deck gets today in Rosyth on a concrete casting for the Deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be on the bridge in its place lifted .

Russia and Turkey : An `` Alliance of outsiders '' ?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis .
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday , to give the hands and proclaim a formal end to the eight months lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponents in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , in the reception , I can not honor me the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation to the most .
There was the handshake , Yes .
But Putin seemed to Smile , tight-lipped , and he radiated almost no heat , even for his laid-back circumstances .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke , however , repeated his `` dear friend '' Putin - according to a report five times .
I could not count it .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to your old level before the crisis , but even be improved .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have had to be in a daze , as if never happened something Bad .
To me , his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite .
But a Putin-emitting , sustainable Coolness showed that the head of state of Russia had nothing to forget .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the First thing he mentioned in his introduction words : the shooting down of a Russian combat aircraft to the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was furious .
Putin informed and accused Ankara to be Russia in the back like that .
The Offense was even greater because it was perpetrated by a supposed friend .
The trust will establish difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , the state-controlled media waged a fierce , full attack on Ankara .
At once it seemed as if the Turks would carry the blame for everything .
The most serious of the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan would have benefited his own family from the illegal Oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic state .
He has vehemently denied .
But in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
Finally , this Meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the excuse he wanted to hear .
Russia has achieved a kind of victory .
For Ankara , the advantages of weapons are at a standstill .
Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed last month in a failed coup almost of his office .
Again terror took attacks on Turkey have shaken him also .
But there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular , the prohibition of Charter flights that bring out every year , usually several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
The number has decreased by almost 90 % .
In Russia , tour operators and Charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed .
You can count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean sea .
This week , the state television predicted that cheaper fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports to be allowed again .
A report in Vedemosti put it as follows : `` tourists there are long , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is on the West angry , since it is acquisition , whose response to the attempted power as a weak response .
The persistent resentment on the snail 's pace of the EU accession negotiations , and Putin is eager to draw from the cool mood Use and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
The Russian head of state won in Ankara with a Bonus that he called after the attempted coup , support for the elected organs of the state .
This is for Moscow , mind you , as a matter of course , the self has to change a deep-seated fear of the Regime .
The summit of this glittering Palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey , as described to me by an analyst , `` Alliance of outsiders '' to represent two countries which are in breach from the West and ill-treated feel , and now ally .
Nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation between the two is still large differences .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemaker , but where do Russia and Turkey have opposing sides to support .
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both presidents at the press conference stating that they would not have touched on the topic once .
The President of Turkey avoided it intentionally to a question about their differences to the answers , while Putin emphasize this decided to .
There is no clear consensus , where there is a common denominator to Syria can be found .
But after months of open hostilities - and , given the potential for a complete Disaster , as NATO-member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again .

As the Gourmets , had President Roosevelt a soft spot for the refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup .
The menu that day was something more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and as a Dessert a plum pudding .

Her husband Andrew Coe added , '' It is also a message to the Americans was , as you eat . ''

CoE 's last book , `` Chop Suey '' was about the Chinese cuisine in the United States , while Ziegelman writes in her book `` 97 Orchard '' about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
Their latest collaboration , `` A decent meal '' , which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publishing house , illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity , as a Reporter in Eisenberg 's Shop Sandwich meet for dinner , a small , pure Snack bar in the Flatiron District , which is already since the stock market crash of 1929 in the business .
Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a cheese sandwich with olives pieces , while Coe , 57 , Turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
As the Reporter meatloaf ordered , this was the Pair for a discussion about food in the Era of the Great Depression fits .
`` Rich food were very popular , '' said Ziegelman .
There was peanut bread , liver , cheese , and beans bread .
They were made from one ingredient and a little Cheap , the stretches of the ingredient .
Imagine , eating so many peanuts that they serve you as dinner .
Coe grinned .
`` It must have been in the stomach like lead , '' he said .
In the years before the Great Depression of the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet .
Teams of women boiled for a male field worker and it was served freshly baked Pie for Breakfast , lunch , and dinner .
It 's the Americans , sent during the first world war of food to starving Europeans . `` A Square Meal '' records the ways by which the country will no longer be treated to be the land of milk and honey .
`` It was a time in the food for the Americans is a Central , tense theme , '' begündete Coe , why he and his wife write about it wanted .
Just as tense , the new budget diet : secret full meals like loaves of bread and the cashier were exploit to roll staple , the Fund 's role as a `` wonderful Art , food scraps reuse , '' said Ziegelman , da chefs were able to hide unsavory ingredients in a creamy Sauce .
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
Meat was for years the center of the American kitchen , it was to rare to be served a luxury .
Peculiar blends have been tried , as a high-calorie and nährhafte satisfaction takes precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind .
During your Research for the book , which includes recipes , prepared Ziegelman , a court of this epoch , baked onions with peanut butter .

Data theft : So perfidious hackers to extort their ransom
Programmer of blackmail Malware attack is currently targeted company and are successful in doing so .
According to a recent survey by the anti-Malware specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America , the UK and Germany , 40 percent of companies surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once , some several times the victim of an attack with malicious Software .
In Germany , nearly 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a Ransomware extortion .
40 percent of victims paid willingly by the perpetrators demanded ransoms to the compromised systems and data re-use .
The perpetrators specialize your blackmailer Software according to the observations of Malwarebytes increasingly to attacks in corporate networks .
You are successful , the potential to gouge the end of ransom is significantly higher than for private users .
`` Today we are seeing a terrifyingly rapid Evolution of malicious software , '' explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with the `` world '' .
In 2008 , most of the malware programs were designed , to send advertising .
Then the perpetrators of the blackmail Software discovered for .
First-time users were private the goal , but the change to the company 's attacks took place in the past few months , shockingly fast .
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern : on the Computer of a victim actively seeks you are specifically looking for recently modified files , such as Word , Excel , or database files as well as archives of images and Videos .
These files are encrypted the Ransomware and delete the originals in a sustainable way .
Then the Software presents the demands of the blackmailer .
In order to get the Endschlüsselungs-Code the files , you must transfer the victim 's money - usually in the Form of the crypto currency Bitcoin .
But where in the case of private users , the personal photo-database on the game.is company sensitive customer data , or project databases , without which the production is at a standstill
Accordingly , the higher the damage is , if a Ransomware hits .
22 percent of German companies reported sales losses caused by Ransomware , 13 percent had to the business activity complete interrupt , in one case , people in life danger .
In Germany , houses were already multiple sick victims of the attacks , the patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records in acute .
`` We say to the Victims is always : do n't Pay , you are promoting the Problem , '' says Kleczynski .
However , 80 to 90 percent of the firms pay to get your data back .
For managers , it is difficult , in the face of deadlock in the operation , the requirement of the offender to reject .
The hackers know this and try everything to have a good Reputation .
In a recent study , security researchers from F-Secure have studied the User interfaces and the contact with the Extortionists , and come to the conclusion that The perpetrators actually try , a kind of customer service to build , to make more money .
You explain to your Victims via Chat , as you by Bitcoin , can pay , free-to-access Support Websites , or to decrypt free sample files .
And private redeemed people after the payments of a few Hundred Euro , companies need to negotiate , in part hard and five-digit numbers sums to your unencrypted data back .
Due to the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the Ransomware extortion , the Hacker will always be professional and share the work , says security expert Chester Wisniewski , from anti-virus vendor Sophos : `` A single Person can write a Ransomware approximately within a week . ''
More likely , however , is that there are three or four people .
The programmers sell their malicious software in the Form of a Software module to the actual blackmailer .
The existing Malware Kits created by the Malware itself , advising , and additional Tools were purchased for a one-off , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
`` In the scope of supply , an adjustment tool is included , so that smaller configurations , appearance and Branding can be changed , '' says Wisniewski .
The blackmailer then look for more hackers to the fresh purchased spread Software among the Victims .
We live in a service economy .
You logged out in one of the forums in the underground , buy the Set of a Criminal , and instructs another in order to install the Software on as many PCs .
The payment is made per infected computer .
`` Usually , the Criminals then instruct spammers with the spread , '' explains Wisniewski .
The risk of Ransomware is now used at many companies are known , which can secure your data better .
About 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes-survey trust , a Ransomware with file-Back-ups and scanner software to fend off .
Accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
`` If the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful Erpessung more , threaten the perpetrators instead , with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , '' explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski .
Thus , the damage potential is depending on the type of data to be many times higher than it was before .
Also , the offender could take in the future , entirely new targets on the Internet of things .
At the hacker conference Defcon , security researchers demonstrated how they were able to get an Internet-connected Thermostat under your control .
In the middle of the Winter could be the activation of such blocked heating some of the victims quite a ransom value .
If the perpetrators of the block then instead of the heater , in the future , a whole production line in a factory , could Ransomware are also in the industry 4.0 a topic .

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : `` go where it hurts ''
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania : The Locals get nothing from the summer election campaign and the holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to select the diet .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern you have understood .
In 2021 , the state election will not take place directly at the end of the summer vacation , has decided the Schwerin Parliament already in the beginning of the year .
As stupid as so far it 's not : summer holidays , heat , and state election campaign - the bite .
The Locals to be convinced of the choice of fighters are on a holiday .
Most of the vacationers who are in the country , on the island of Usedom , Rügen and Hiddensee on-the-go , are not Natives , they are not allowed to select the diet .
These are practical problems : In the holiday volunteers , the posters are inflating , balloons , distributing flyers , and at the end of vote counting , just hard to find .
To 4 . September 2016 , the election and the last day , must of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania once again the election campaign , at the people passing endure .
The hot Phase , if one can even say , has just begun .
And it 's also about something : the Prime Minister , Erwin Sellering , the leader of a SPD/CDU coalition , has to fear for his office .
The SPD since 1998 , the strongest party , is now in the polls , well behind the CDU .
Exciting it is , how strong is a newcomer to the AfD is performing and what remains at the end of the coalition-grade left .
Selle ring , 66 years old , and since 2008 the head of government , makes an almost inconspicuous-looking election campaign , one of his large posters .
He travels the country , distributed roses and plauscht a little with the people , so as to be legendary taciturn predecessor , Harald Ringstorff , fact .
Otherwise soul ring got cold feet and Chancellor Angela Merkel to blame for the Bloom of the AfD .
Their refugee policy , you do have accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists , which will cost him now will probably be the nice the office .
The CDU , with its top candidate , the Minister of the interior Lorenz Caffier , has already experienced what it is like when you at the wrong time , right place campaign .
She has twice been invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large rallies ; Merkel election to the Bundestag circle is located in the North-East .
But the target audience is wrong , it 's more of North Rhine-were-Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania .
`` As the majority of other States was likely , '' said Vincent Kokert , Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , recently in the NDR .
But it is a pity also to anyone from other parts of Germany , even Angela Merkel to listen to .
Otherwise , the northeast , the CDU largely dispenses with the usual election campaign stalls at market places and shopping malls with parasols , and air balloons .
So , Kokert assumes only play a `` subordinate role '' .
The European Union has also noticed that her wegbröselt on the Land base that you have to work very hard , to find a wire to the people .
She 's like the Left , the SPD , the Greens : in the far reaches of the country .
The Council of the CDU-choice of fighter Kokert to his comrades-in-arms , however , is also self-revealing : `` you have to go where it hurts , namely , where the people are : village celebrations , Golden weddings , any birthday celebration needs to be used '' .

Donald Trump explains his statement Obama had been was founded ISIS `` sarcasm ''
Donald J. Trump tried to disperse on Friday , the last controversy surrounding his campaign , he stated that his multi-repeated claim , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the `` founder '' of the terrorist group Islamic state , was not meant seriously .
This raised a clarification , new questions on the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republicans , if he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American Public .
It is also his comrades-in-arms , the effort brings him during an event Phase , to take into protection , in the peculiar Position statements explain that he might not have even meant .
After he had made the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , rowed back to Mr. Trump in respect of the claim on Thursday and insisted in Interviews that he really had not intended to imply , the President and Mrs. Clinton ISIS .
But in an early-morning Tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was just being sarcastic .
The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day , at which Mr. Trump said in a series of Interviews , he said the accusation is completely serious .
As the conservative radio wanted to help the moderator Hugh Hewitt , Mr. Trump , the statement is to mitigate a little by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , wanted to know the Republican presidential candidate , none of that .
The last storm of criticism rains down upon Mr. Trump , while he has to steer trying to take the focus of his campaign because of falling poll numbers on the economy .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave Speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried to return again on this topic .
On Twitter reporting he warned that Mrs. Clinton would lead the proposals for higher taxes and that he is to have found your speech to be boring .
Mr. Trump has argued sarcasm already to his defense .
At the end of July , he drew strong criticism , as he said , the Russians should chop Mrs. Clinton 's e-mails , however , he explained later , `` of Course , I was attempting to be sarcastic '' .
This method allowed Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in the policy and to return it on demand .
`` I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages will be received by his Fans , as they arrive , and then , if necessary , `` to clarify '' , depending on the reaction. `` said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert , observed that the language of both candidates .
But I also believe , he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
To defuse rather than set the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Trump accepted an even etching their sound , as his poll numbers continue to decline .
A new poll from NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a large margin in the States of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head-to-head race in Florida .
While Mr. Trump tried to have for his provocative Statements , not to apologize , he blames his critics often to distort his statements , or to understand his sense of Humor wrong .
But while the attention is an increasing focus in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. trump 's jokes , brought his loyal comrades-in-arms in the uncomfortable Situation to have to stand by him , regardless of how provocative like his statements .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , former mayor of New York , and one of trump 's most prominent advocates , took great pains to defend the candidate today in a CNN Interview on Thursday .
`` I think what he says legitimate , political comments , '' Mr. Giuliani said , he was questioned as to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have established the Islamic state .
It is in this sense true that prior to Obama , ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called backbenchers , utterly wrong , and that 's why it happened , because he withdrew the troops from Iraq .
Most of the Mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government , under Obama , served in the Mrs. Clinton as Secretary of state , it allowed ISIS to spread by allowing it to bring the Situation in the Middle East , aggressive under control .
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them , on each of his words ride around and against him is biased .
He mocked the `` poor , wretched '' television experts who try to understand him , and said , `` you can do it ! `` .
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. trump 's apology as just a further proof that he is for the presidency to be unsuitable .

England claimed four years ago , a shocking victory , while the Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals .
They repeated the Trick , after you picked up in March at the world track Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys only a modest sixth place .
The Problem is between Beijing and London , the replacement of the Anfahrers Jamie Staff was .
They did this in a timely manner as Hindes appeared .
Hoys retirement created a gap , Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close .
Skinner was the man , they remained , as they saw potential in the Scotsman , which has now developed .
Hindes , Kenny - the won four years ago , with Hoy and Skinner sat in the qualifying rounds , an Olympic record , but in the standard rounds were won by the new Zealanders in the first round .
And the British Trio won the duel with Gold .
Hindes fell after his round , tight , but Kenny brought the Team to the front , and Skinner thought it was .
A change of strategy was a big part of the Transformation , in the Hindes in a higher gear drove to slow it down and allow it Kenny , and especially Skinner to keep the pace .
Hoy looked out of his Position as a BBC expert , and it occurred to Skinner , Kenny and Hindes , as these rose to the podium .
The 23-year-old Skinner , from Glasgow , said : `` It is a flattering is the comparison . ''
I 'm just here to do my Best and to make a name for myself .
We have placed in the final round , an Olympic record and the world champion defeated .
It was just incredible .
There is no better way to win this .
After the Triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny 's and Hoys Hindes admitted that he fell after a weak Start on purpose on the train .
He withdrew this statement later , and there is no right of appeal of England 's rivals came .
In a stunning victory this Time there was no such Problem .
Hindes said : `` It feels with all the GB flags on the grandstand as London . ''
We came together in the last three months as a Team .
We have titles with so many of the World 's so bad , that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
This is an event , a gold medal for the Nation which won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and in London .
If this is a Barometer of our progress in the last five months that await us successful five days in the velodrome .
With the Form of Kenny 's , it is Possible that he medals Hoys win three Olympic gold in a competition repeatedly .
This would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , also on 23 . March , was born ( apparently a sacred date for the British sports ; on the day , Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger were born Bannister ) - a yield of six gold medals and one silver medal mean .
It would be the same of Hoy .
Kenny takes the next Sprint , which starts today , and in three days will go .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said : `` I 'm enjoying this just for the Moment . ''
The Team event is always best .
You can win it with his colleagues .
It feels a bit lonely , to win alone .

It was the only medal competition of the day , but there was more good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-man , Four-kilometre race .
They arrived in 3:51,942 on the target .

In the corresponding Women 's event , which continues tomorrow and finishes , advanced Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world-record time in 4:13,260 .
The GB Team relies on its strong track Cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic games and to pick up a bevy of medals .
After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
It is drama being played in the Background , the resignation of the technical Director Shane Sutton in April , in the midst of sexism and bullying allegations , as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
If you look at the first night of competition at the velodrome , it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GBs , the has reached the perfect Moment of his climax could be repeated again .

Military service information , guide distort ISIS secret Committee of Congress
Members of the military of the United States Central Command , altered intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site , pending an investigation Committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
The preliminary Report created by a Task Force of Republican members of the armed services Committee , intelligence Committee and the military budget kommites , reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts have reported on how managers changed their assessment of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state .
The Central Command , in short , Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` Intelligence information , a senior Centcom commanders were typically rubber-stamped manner , signed regularly , a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services '' , - quoted a newspaper article on the report .
`` What happened at Centcom , is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses of our political leaders are presented , '' said Ken Calvert , Republican member of the house of representatives .
The Leadership failure in the Centcom reach up to the top of the organization .
The ten page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
Although there is no direct evidence to suggest that the government have given tips under Obama 's instructions , to change the reports , it shows how analysts are going to put the pressure of their pre-exposed to saw , to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or ISIL , .
`` During the first half of the year 2015 , many of the Central Command press releases , goods , opinions , and statements before Congress , stated significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts '' of the report .
For example , a Centcom announced pair publicly that a military reconquest Mossuls could already begin in April or may 2015 .
Mosul , Iraq 's second largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic state .
`` After months of investigation , this much is clear . '' said Mike Pompeo , a Republican Congressman from Kansas , in a statement .
By the middle of 2014 until the middle of the year 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports that the threat by ISIS to play in Iraq .
The Republicans called the Task Force , after you tool that analysts are Worried regarding the Manipulation of Reports to the Islamic state .
The on Thursday released the report by more detailed findings completed during the investigation will be continued .
In addition , further investigation of the Centcom reports by the inspector General of the defense Ministry are in progress .
Democratic members of the intelligence Committee , published on Thursday their own findings , which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force .
`` In the years 2014 and 2015 , the Centcom created an unduly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services '' , announced the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee , a member of the house of representatives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
This process , Mr. Schiff , `` delayed the publication of intelligence Reports , '' damaged the morale among analysts and `` excessively little room for dissenting opinions . ''
But Mr. ship-and the Democrats claimed to have no information on Intervention of the White house in the Centcom analysts in terms of a `` political opinion '' found .
The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by `` The Daily Beast '' .
Last August , the New York Times reported that investigations by the inspector General of the Pentagon taken after complaints from the Centcom analysts .
Lt. Cmdr . Patrick Evans , a spokesman for the Pentagon , said in a statement that the Ministry of defence would comment on the reports of the Congress , during the investigation of the inspector General are still in progress .
But he also admitted that `` experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the Interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . ''
The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim which is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of defence ) .
The accusations of the past year have , however , raised the question of whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of the military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
The criticism with regard to the intelligence information about the Islamic state are reminiscent of arguments from more than ten years ago , as a Centcom Analyst , Gregory Hooker , a piece of writing wrote about how the then government under George W. Bush , did , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , only a small occupation force in Iraq and little time transformations , to think about the consequences of the Invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current system of reporting on the Islamic state .
In the past year , the Team of Mr. Hooker , after giving the government notes that , contrary to the statements of the government air strikes against the Islamic state-held refineries would have no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group , as these makeshift refineries would be put into operation , in order to sell Oil on the black market .
This finding , however , was not released , reported the Times in September .
Centcoms former commander , gen Lloyd J. Austin III , has been criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive evaluation of the war situation , at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin was in April , retired and was replaced at Central Command by gen Joseph L. Votel .

Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day medication , after by the authorities , it was recommended this to more people for a longer period of time to administer .
The antiplatelet drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .

The regulatory authority NICE , the NHS has recommended a four-year-long taking to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Around 140,000 people suffer each year from a heart attack and a quarter of them will suffer another heart attack or a stroke .
Heart attacks and strokes fat seizures by collections containing material in the arteries causes the walls , of the pads .
If the plaque breaks apart , it can cause a blood clot that plugs the blood flow to the heart and thus a heart attack caused .
If the blood clot breaks off , it can flow through the blood stream and the blood flow to the brain become clogged , which caused a stroke .
People who have already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk of another one .
Ticagrelor , which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca under the trade name Brilique is distributed , reduced this risk by making blood clots less likely .
The manual design from NICE , published today , recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of Aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , Director of NICE 's health technology evaluation centre , said : `` Despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack will have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . ''
The fear of a recurrence of a heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a Person .
The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with Aspirin is effective in the reduction of further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
By a provisional recommendation of Ticagrelor , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to the thousands of people who can benefit from it .
The Information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding is limited to a period of up to three years . The draft does not recommend a treatment that goes beyond this period .

A caught athlete would have almost won a medal .

The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000-meters-obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically eyed track and field competitions , this news comes at an inopportune time .
Chen had already been on last Sunday , the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide , demonstrated that is used as a masking agent for doping substances .
The International court of arbitration for sport , CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time , their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
On Sunday , the 18-Year-old in fourth place in the finals , had finished about 100 metres butterfly , only 0.09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen should have been on the heats 50 m free style participate .
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , the Opening of the B sample and a hearing .
The national Federation will take the matter `` very seriously and demands that Chen full cooperation in the investigation , '' Xinhua quoted from a message : `` We will work together with the International sports court CAS , and accept the verdict '' .
For the first time in the history , not the IOC , but the CAS is for the sanctioning of the athletes with positive cases .
Also in the night of Rio , the news was leaked about the positive sample at Danekowa , the 33-Year-old went on the Offensive .
`` I had BNT three Tests , all negative , and my fourth Test was positive '' , this was `` an incredible shock , '' she told the Bulgarian TV channel .
She was innocent , `` the only explanation might be dietary supplements , '' said the athlete .
According to the report , it should be of a prohibited substance to the blood doping agent EPO .
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended , according to the BNT , the B-sample is already positive .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov , reacted immediately with criticism of the athlete .
`` I do n't understand why the athletes draw the right conclusions , '' he said : `` We , Bulgarians , are under observation , as many have already been excluded '' .
So all of the weight lifter from the chronic doping Servient Nation may not participate in Rio .

Constantly being screwed in the name of counter-terrorism laws .
After the recent attacks , interior Minister de Maizière now presents a big security package .
But what has this to do with a tolerated status with Terror ?
And what the coalition partners have to say about all this ?
Thomas de Maizière is the reconciler .
All of his proposals were the coalition partners of `` politically reasonable '' , says the Federal Minister of the interior at the launch of his new security package .
You overwhelm anyone .
Other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
Also due to the fact I participate .
As interior Minister , he was located but results in a `` recoverable consensus '' within the coalition .
De Maizière after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach a little time to elapse before he presented his conclusions for the security of the Republic .
The fall for now , however , the more extensive .
A lot is already known , proclaimed , target : a new safety authority to Crack encrypted communications to take care of , is not new .
Not even the fact that Germany needs to implement a number of EU regulations on air passenger data , and weapons law .
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security agencies is not as surprising .
Part of de Maizière starts a second calls for proposals that were not make with the SPD so far : He wants to make sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and jihadists will not be so forgiving with dual citizenship , German passport .
`` It will be difficult points for the SPD , '' admits the CDU-man .
He think it is still acceptable to them and also call nothing , what have the coalition partner anyway , no chances .
A couple of new ideas presented to de Maizière .
Have it be partially : He plans to fast-track procedure for deportation and detention of people facing deportation .
Refugees , who are specifically brought into the country , to let your smartphone check-in and Social-Media Accounts for a security check .
In Short-for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to commit some of the worse places than previously - for example in the crimes or their papers aware of throw away , in order to disguise your identity .
Some of it is politically and legally sensitive .
Some of it also seems half-baked and leaves open questions .
And at some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of Tolerated , for example - the question arises : What has this to do with security and terrorist ?
Yes , says de Maizière , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and Terror .
But it can not be denied that the assassin of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees .
In addition , many people were given the high numbers of Refugees .
And things , the employees , the people deeply , also in times of election campaigns does not exclude .
The internal security is extremely in focus .
Only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , and nice .
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
The uncertainty is large .
And Yes , it 's an election fights .
Union and SPD to bring the issue of internal security , therefore , is increasingly in the position .
In the past few days , it went between the two parties .
A nasty dispute over the facilities of the Federal police , then a security-political ideas-a collection of some of the Unions-the Minister of the interior , the Department heads are calling for a burqa ban and a move away from the dual citizenship .
De Maizière strives even here to conciliatory tones .
Of a departure from the double-pass he do n't believe in .
We have pacified the discussion in Germany .
They re-open , would not be meaningful .
And in the case of a burqa ban , he had constitutional concerns .
Whether its own package is to all corners of the Constitution and whether or not it is actually `` reasonable '' for the coalition partner , must only still show up .
There is a lot in there , what could make for a fight .
But the SPD is currently trying to make a name for themselves on the subject of internal security .
Party chief Sigmar Gabriel willingness to talk and says signaled for the first time , carefully : `` The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase the security '' .

Destination plates : who buys vinyl records ?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates .
Before you rush to the comment section to ravage him under the Pseudonym of all the lonely men of middle age , with harsh insults , this statement is derived from the current data .
According to YouGov , the much talked about resurrection of vinyl records not on a Boom in Millennials , who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Midlife is due to nostalgia .
Those who have recently purchased a plate , are expected to be between the ages of 45 and 54 .
In fact , the age group of 18-24 are the most unlikely group of buyers .
There is also no hordes is collectors by Hobby - it has an emotional meaning : older record-buyers to keep their feelings more to themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But the results of YouGov ?
If this Blog is a news report would be on TV , would follow me the camera while I walk in the midst of a bustling street in Soho , a modest gray suit and wild gestuliere , before I stop , my hands and something Decisive to say : `` So , let 's take a closer look at it . ''
So , let us take a look at it .
Even if the heart of SOHO is losing slowly its charm - Hotels , Restaurants , and offices fill the building , in which independent vendors were located - there are a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would ask the camera man probably , the camera for the next part off , I am in close proximity to different men in such transactions , and attempts , your age and state of mind through observation to assess .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , the I result of Sister Ray ( number of Data : two young women , three middle-aged men ) , Reckless Records ( number of Data : eight middle-aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long due to a meeting in London and going through the shops in order to fill the couple of hours .
He is a collector , I ask ?
`` I guess , '' he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
These records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by E-Mail , I 'm not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and Singles , is the result of his disposable income he is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford , as they appeared , and to buy again the items , which he sold when he was young and broke .
`` Many of the things I buy are from the late ' 60s , early ' 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . Things I was probably a little young to buy them for me , '' he says .
He agrees that those who buy plates , are more introverted and like to be alone , to spend time , and adds : `` I do n't smoke and I do n't drink very much .
This is my truck .
GMT , 25 , works at Sister Ray , also believes that many of the customers he meets , apply to the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people that are affected by the Medienhpe to buy people who have heard about the Comeback and forced to see again your old plates .
From the conversations I have had , got rid of people in General , so around 1998 or 1999 your collection .
Customers , selling their records to buy CDs , sell your CDs , to buy back your plates , '' he says .
That would explain the Boom trailers of the plate revivals of a certain age .
But what is with the alleged emotional meaning of the plates ?
It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica , to recognize that record shops provides a calming community of like-minded people .
According to GMT , some of the older customers took offence at the contactless payment system .
Some of the plate 's fans feel from the digital world , overwhelmed and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves back , of items , the happy youth memories .
`` I think sometimes it can Fill a Void , and the ownership of material possessions as a kind of consolation , '' says Wez .
This is for me as a collector , and I think that it is for many people .
It is a simple way to deal with mentally .
`` We are like social workers ! '' trills an employee of a plate stack .
A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who have bought last month a record that you have not listened to yet .
The survey also found that 41 % have a record player you never use , while 7 % of those that buy a plate , do not have a record player .
At this stage of the news report , I look probably very worried , while I flip through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of Data : three middle-aged men ) , has noted a `` trophy aspect '' of the Revivals .
`` Someone just recently came in here and said : `` I do n't have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radiohead record , so I can put them on the shelf , '' he says .
This is not a great percentage , but it happens definitely .
More product heavy , less music-heavy .
We have people who say : `` I do n't have a record player . ''
These are younger people , not older people , which will only come slowly .
Fopp , which has been dedicated to the records , almost an entire floor , has a more colorful audience , as I 'm going in .
There are a couple of the 70 , tourists take photos , teenage boys and middle-aged women .
Even if the atmosphere relaxes a little less than in the above-mentioned transactions , the Wild Beasts of the latest synth - and sexbepackter Pop instead of experimental Jazz blaring from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity in the customer .
None of them seem to be very lonely , but lingering psychological trauma are difficult to determine , if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , is running around for a few minutes in the store and seen the variety of the for sale boards .
Makes you more of a window shopping than shopping in bulk .
You are not worthy of much , therefore the collection of disks is not a real Option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It is easy to listen to music from a Computer or in any other way , but the beauty of plates is ... '' she pushes with a lovestruck sigh .
I do n't know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
My last Stop is a business where , it is said , that a new Generation of record lovers inspired to have : Urban Outfitters .
While I give the appearance , to patterns , Jeans-Hotpants , I watch a group of young teenage girls , the group for a Moment to Polaroid cameras , before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player .
To the Left is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential boards for an average collection .
No one looks at it - maybe because they are just purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible for them to handle .
It is pure `` plate art '' .
But in view of the fact that any attraction could mean for these items is more money for the industry and some customers in the Depths of SOHO for a more chic , there is nothing to complain .
It is no Surprise that a group of people that has more time and money than others , is also the one the most on luxury items such as plates will be issued .
Even if my Research showed that the results of the YouGov vote , at least in record shops in Soho , the large number of female collectors , and record lovers that exist in reality , record stores and in online forums .
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
You do n't have to spend your Thursday morning with the Stroll through the record shops of Berwick Street and scroll through panels , while the rigid look of a creepy , 30-year-old false Moderator to avoid that rises over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men .

Hillary Clinton has published on Friday of your tax return for 2015 , this was for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband , an income of USD 10,75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 34.2 % .
In 2015 , the Clintons donated USD 1 Million to charity , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $ 5.3 million in speech fees ; the former Secretary of state gave an income of USD 3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure in the Ministry of foreign Affairs .

They paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.3 % in the year 2015 .
`` Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set Standards in terms of financial transparency , '' announced Clinton 's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri , in an opinion .
In a stark contrast , Donald Trump hiding behind false excuses and return migrants in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
It is common for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns , although they are not obliged to by law .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have given as a reason for its denial of a tax audit by the tax authorities .
`` You are on the train , '' wrote Clinton campaign worker Ian Sams on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , trump 's special adviser said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax audits are not completed .
Trump 's critics , including the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , Mitt Romney , have already said that his refusal raises questions in respect of property , and its donations to charitable organizations , his business practices , and various other Compounds , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has fallen already on the topic , and on Friday , a Video posted on the Internet , in the high level Republican Trump 's call to release his tax returns .
On Thursday she spoke to the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
`` He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in recent decades , and to publish his tax returns . '' she said to the crowd .
Politico reported that Trump paid during the 1990s , for two years , no or very little taxes , and a business journalist for the New York Times quoted on Friday a series of Steueranwältenn and tax advisors , the information , that could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become the electoral issue .
Clinton supports a scheme , which is named after billionaire Investor Warren Buffett , would ensure that people earning more than USD 1 Million with a tax rate of at least 30 % of pay .
President Obama supports the proposal .
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Nebraska , Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its headquarters here , called to replace Trump a Meeting on their tax returns .
Buffett said he had also been a tax audit , the IRS subjected and Trump have a `` fear '' of the voters and not in front of the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007 .
The Clintons paid now in Chappaqua , New York life , the average effective Federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 % in .
The tax statement from the Clinton 's of 2015 showed that this relation is only USD 100 of your income as a salary , unlike the vast majority of Americans .
Their main money system is a cost-effective index funds , from which the Clintons taxed dividends and other income of USD 109.000 .

The Echo of the Trainer , Robin Williams , was allanwesend as they rowed for the second Olympic gold in the Two without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , which laid such a scale .
Their dominance was absolute , after all , your 39.ter undefeated use , which is also unprecedented .
What we have are two brilliant athletes , on the surface with the elegance of swans gliding , which does not reflect the kind of triumph to the full.see
Behind every Gold in rowing a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and there was no one assistant as the coach who did n't know 30 months ago , if he would survive this day at all , as in the case of cancer was diagnosed .
As he said , risky .
I had cancer of the bladder , which is easily operable , and they did .
If you do n't do that , it spreads everywhere .
It would have been a pretty bad Situation .
It changed a little bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The Trio was lucky that he had treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , was about to begin , what is the interruption kept to a Minimum , if at all , under such circumstances , even the right term .
I needed money , so it had to go me better soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran to the Station , around 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time , as you said that few steps are sufficient .
So it begins .
The rowing itself is a challenge , but that makes it even greater .
The immediacy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , the grueling a nervous Morning for something to spent more than to talk otherwise , and thus tried to handle his own Fears .
Stanning , who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment on a mission in Afghanistan , said , `` I was this week an emotional wreck . Perhaps that 's a little extreme , but it means so much . ''

I could n't imagine a better Person to Train or a better Trainer of your choice .

Even in the last 500 meters , as the Teams from new Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , had to Stanning and Glover too much in Reserve .
We were very caught up in the Moment .
Helen cried , `` stay in the process , stay in the process '' .
It is really important not to get carried away .
We had a good Start , and at the same time , we were not there to make something Great .
We wanted to today , no fireworks , we just wanted to get a good result , to go out and win the race , which we did .
The Couple will take a one-year break , before it will make decisions about his future .
Glover needs to appear next week at a wedding of their own with the TV adventurer Steve back hall .
Now you want to just enjoy the Moment .
I did n't want to say that this was my last race .
That would have meant too much pressure .
In London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
Here , it took about four minutes .
It feels so much better , '' she said .

Who builds the city cheap apartments ?
The SPD and the greens think that investors will in future have to be taken much more responsibility .
How to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose in the next few years , almost 1,300 affordable apartments ?
The SPD proposes to the next meeting of the Council , a `` concept of Housing '' .
But the dispute is programmed .
First and foremost , the question is : Who should build the affordable housing ?
A control is missing so far .
SPD parliamentary group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says : `` We are with the Greens agree : Who wants to build on city land , must in future designate 20 per cent of all housing as social housing . ''
The cheap apartments , however , can also arise in the portfolio .
The major point of contention in the town hall , however , so Bratmann : `` How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? ''
`` We want investors to build on such land at least 10 percent , but preferably 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . ''
A new urban housing assistance program , which will cost millions and still has to be financed , is to provide incentives .
The Problem , Bratmann : `` There is currently no agreement between the factions . ''
The CDU wants to make investors a minimum number of rules .
The Left wants yet requirements for investors hardness .
Notwithstanding the foregoing , so Bratmann , to make an aggravation of the Situation on the housing market .
The action concept is implemented , it will provide for additional duties in the construction administration .
More staff is needed .
It is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
But still the program is not entirely Because of the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built .
But how you can compensate for the loss of a further approximately 1300 affordable housing , the development of which will expire in the next few years ?
Alone up to the year 2020 , there will be 500 apartments .
To prevent this , the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm , should now be expiring at the end of bonds of the city purchased .
In addition , would have to be thought about , to bring apartments back into the price-fixing .
This is in the West side of the city .
At a stroke the Problem could be solved .
Because in the West end of the city , the time limits run of the year .
Approximately 1800 homes , you could get there and back in the price fixing for cheap apartments .
Only : The owners , the housing associations do not want to .
Because the number of social housing units in the West side of the city is increased dramatically , it moves away from the target of the so-called mixing .
A concentration of socially weak in a few city , there will be no more parts .
The Greens expect that there will be any movement in the discussion .
Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke says : `` For a wide majority , the CDU must be in the boat . ''
The have focused on more building sites for single family homes .
Which is not to say , however , that is not a compromise can be found .

The company has targeted at the ad-blocker on Desktop PCs , since mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebooks mobile App for the social network and Instagram , said a spokesman .
Advertising on a Desktop PC makes up a large enough share of the revenue , so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as rewarding .
On Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update the `` display preferences tool '' , in order to have the people more control over to you specific advertising .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that Adblocks new Filter concern would be worrying , because they would also block content on the page , no advertising .
`` For the users , this is not a positive experience , therefore , we plan to address the issue , '' said a spokesman for Facebook in an E-Mail message .
Ad blockers are a blunt means , which is why we have us , instead , to developer tools like Ad Preferences to be concentrated in order to place more control in the hands of the people .

She sees herself as the contact person for all actors involved : refugees , working group on refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who will be involved .
Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there , the eggs legend Jack of all trades , has a Problem .
Some had less mocking and more on the variety of desired tasks in targeted areas - meant , as the administration wanted to contest the point .
Was looking for an administrative professional with a Talent for languages and people , connected with many years of experience in the field of social work , a Jack of all trades .
However , administrative work is not your main area , says Annika Deuschle .
Especially going to be the organization , working with the local people and behind-the-Scenes , as well as network activity .
The 31-Year-old for about six weeks .
She has a temporary 50-percent point , to three years .
`` It was high time , '' says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle honor - and the main support of official actors .
There are big and small problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
Soon a new Container in the Wasen road
A serious Problem is there since some time , to find housing for the connection of the refugees who have been recognized .
For the follow-up accommodation are the responsibility of municipalities .
You need to the refugees in their own or rented residential premises .
The cost for the construction , rental , or renovation of these properties will have to bear the municipalities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and the job centre .
Problem : There are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
The search is on for some time as very difficult .
De facto , the management finds no private apartments .
It 's not working so far , you had to rely on private dwellings , Deuschle .
Therefore , municipal apartments need to be upgraded , as it is so beautiful .
So soon to be placed in the new Container in the Wasen road .
But with apartments it is not done .
Perspective , the keyword is Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a fixed place to Stay , there are internships , training places , school places , -Euro-Jobs and Temporary jobs for refugees and migrants , the gefundnen or set up .
`` More places would be good , '' says Regine customer .

The `` no-work '' .
Activity does not mean only work .
Of the day need a solid structure , say Deuschle and the customer .
The people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
So there is a need for programmes such as Sport , contacts with the Locals , and especially language courses .
Professional courses are scarce .
So , administrative and Volunteer to be a jump here , too .
It is Central that the refugees get the feeling that you were in Germany , and welcome .
The long duration of the procedure had a Problem .
You have to explain to the refugees that it takes a long time and you can bypass the time-useful , for example , with language courses .
Who will develop at some point the feeling that he could help in Urbach anyone , could not work and was useless , the will to integrate never .
The clear majority was motivated .
Problem cases there are but also says a customer , to be honest , `` people , where anything goes '' . The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others .
All of this was a `` mammoth task '' .
A difficult question : Have the two of them after the recent occurrences , and the fear of radicalisation , even in a small community such as Urbach ?
`` No , '' says Regine customer is clearly , `` what may some call naive . '' A residual risk can not and does not want to exclude .
Be aware of the helpers .
These incidents were also the subject of the refugees .
The had the fear that the assassin will bring you completely into disrepute .
`` You want to show that they have nothing to do with it , '' says Regine customer .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
So and Volunteers are on - site and in the Region need to keep activities looking .
They always have in the Background that soon a new shock could come on refugees and migrants , according to Urbach .
Does Germany need an upper limit ?
To answer this question clearly , is not afraid of the policy .
Actually , it is unfair , you helpers on the spot .
`` In Urbach , we are not yet arrived where we want to go , '' says Annika Deuschle .
No new refugees would be able to relax .
Regine customer is also clear that the Urbacher are also utilized to integrate the human reasonable .
The are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
But if people are in Need , you have to help you , both women agree .
The political situation in the world is so complicated , because there are no easy answers .

Snapchat `` Anime '' effect criticized as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this Anime Filter is inspired , but some observers say that it is insensitive to races .
With its filter tool allows Snapchat to approximately 150 million daily users , to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that it borders on the Absurd .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog , or a figure that could be a painting from Roy Lichtenstein .
The filters are blunt , feature twisting Tools , which generate more than 30 million improved Selfies per day .
All of the missteps to reach the Public .
Snapchat filters have drawn in the past , criticism , in which they were accused , that the App promotes Blackface or white skin as the ideal of beauty would propagate .
As it is this week some of the users have a Filter suggested , gave them slit eyes , false teeth , and bloated cheeks , called it some of the critics , a racist caricature of Asians - `` yellow face '' .
They wondered whether these repeated Controversies , pointing to a bigger Problem that the company has with diversity .
The news and the outrage was widespread on Wednesday , with the Reports of The Verge , Motherboard , a day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the Feature .
The company offered an apology : The Filter was intended as a tribute to Anime characters , and not as a caricature of Asians .
But outsiders who have experienced Racism , reminded of the Filter to hurtful stereotypes .
Others disliked the Anime comparison .
In an E-Mail to Grace Sparapani , a Korea wrote Japanese-American art student , whose Tweet has been disseminated about the photos that the Filter was `` hurtful and to say the least , unpleasant . ''
She added that `` it is difficult to argue the opposite position of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
It shows that the Filter is yellow faced , but that the yellow face was drawn into derogatory to the Extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trip wires .
The American culture seems to be in an endless Diversity and integration-the battle of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the Hand .
And Snapchat 's large audience of young people - in terms of race more diverse than their older counter - players are more likely to assume , to expect sensitivity .
If one of Snapchats a picture Filter created for a User offensive , `` so it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed , as was previously the case , '' said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an Interview on Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who works as a product Manager and engineer for Medium decided to your Snapchat account delete called on others to do the same .
In an essay for Medium , and in a telephone interview , you said that you believe that race-related Controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices in the case of Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the largely white , male leadership and finished snapchat your essay with a Hashtag : # Delete .
`` Either you have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that you can make such decisions , '' said the Chinese-American Zhu , `` or you have people with other skin colors who work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe , or comfortable , to say something about it . ''
Others share your opinion , a complaint , Snapchat is largely unanswered left .
The company does not publish Figures on the diversity of its workforce and draws attention to its Status as a private company .
On Thursday it declined to Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company has set recently a recruiter that focuses on under-represented population groups and to internal integration efforts .
Zhu said that they will leave your Snapchat account was closed and added , `` I wonder if you need more Users like us , to not be able to say that this is o. K . ''

`` There were significant Overruns , '' says King , who made himself the whole time about the situation competently .
Since two to three have been flashed per Minute .
The fastest was 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo-30-Zone on-the-go .
Since the site has moved on , it became but quiet .
For the business people on the B 27 , it is only a small consolation that for clients in Rottenburg now the road is open again .
In the cards business , people do not like it .
But the B 27-restructuring has led to decline in sales , everyone that asks .
However , some more and some less affected .
Who produced to do with the `` end users '' , less so for other companies , for the restructuring has consequences .
Also at Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a `` slight decline '' , but admits also that , of course , `` the walk-in customers missing '' .
Most of the Local along the road are buffeted .
J. Albert goehner , owner of the Steakhouse , formerly the crown , finds clear words .
This is existence-threatening .
Not only him , but all the restaurants have `` hit hard '' .
It is the customer from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil were missing .
We have to be happy about every Euro of sales .
The loss of revenue he estimated at `` well over 50 percent '' .
The road rehabilitation have thrown the business , `` two years back '' .
Half of his employees , he had to be dismissed .
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been fired , would he have reacted to the policy differently .
Instead , the President of the government , Jörg Schmidt on a request from goehner has answered , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the note , the restaurant benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . Now she had to bear the disadvantages arising from the redevelopment .
Goehner know of other districts where such a thing generous was handled .
In the case of all claims arising out of goehner is sure his restaurant will continue to exist .
Finally , the family-run business since 1715 settled here , he refers to the long history .
That the other regulars are now looking , due to the complex traffic management less frequently in the past , can he understand .
If you ca n't drive , it 's somewhere else nice .
Its regular clientele after the end of the renovation work comes back , it Göhner has no doubts .
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu goehner considers the impact of the B 27-construction works on its clientele for the biggest crisis , which has seen its restaurant in its long history .
Six months of construction work , which is already brutal .

In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic games , the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic games .
The events in Rio de Janeiro to feel resistant , and inevitably , a frantic relay race between competition and striving .
It is , as the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod , which is passed from the archers to the float to Turner for triathletes .
You ca n't turn on the TV , read a newspaper , or at the call of your neighbors in the queue in the coffee shop listening without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky , or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there are Logan Dooley .
Dooley , for the first Time at the Olympics and a heartthrob with the dimples , would definitely build among these well-known names to be sent to the Prime Time , through sponsors and feel-good TV ads , if he was a swimmer , gymnast or even fencers .
But Dooley , 28 , of Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the Olympic trampoline gymnastics Gold .
The Olympic flame lights every event .
Further from the centre , partly in the shadow of the sports that are not generally recognised : air gun shooting , archery , Badminton , Taekwondo .
We will always have the Breaststroke , and may it reign be long .
But if I could humbly make arguments for my particular favorite , then let me attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline to steer .
Although the trampoline since 2000 , an Olympic event , as it had in Sydney , made his debut , there has not been perceived in the past 16 years , so sparse , that a lot of the , I had interviewed knew that it is an Olympic sport .
This could also be regional ignorance .
Although the United States has sent athletes to the Competition , it has never won a medal in jump on the trampoline and up to 2012 , athletes had made it to the finals .
The Chinese and the Russians tend to be the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians share the for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend this year , her gold medal from London .
The trampoline has jump a certain outsider charm , partly because it sounds for the uninformed ear , more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympic games .
At this point I should admit that I 'm no expert , but just an earthbound Enthusiast .
It is humorist has potential - the cartoon-like Shaking of his never-ending thunderous impact , but also the grace of the gymnastics and diving , the two sports that unites it .
The word `` trampoline '' comes from the Spanish El Trampolin , which means `` diving Board . ''
Emerging the winner , jump on a giant trampoline , shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and a number of the movements ( Turn , dive , and somersaults ) must , before you land on your feet .
You will be assessed according to the official Olympic program after the execution , difficulty , and `` flight time '' .
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other .
The most common Olympic vector is a straight line .
Medal hopeful must go in their quest for Gold further , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the target , sometimes there and back , up and down on the Playground .
You are not just chasing the finish line or the starting wall , but in the TV broadcast also another scornful aim : to make the world or Olympic record .
The goal-oriented striving is noble , admirable , even fanatical , and it is enough to stir even an audience to tears .
But it is also what I feel when watching these games as a little tiring .
The trampoline offers a pause for breath .
The vector of the trampoline jumper is at the top .
A forward movement is not the goal .
He or she bounces off , seemingly weightless as an Astronaut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back to the top .
Here , too , there is competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during the Exercise there is no frantic attack on the target , not a Dome in the distance , only the dreamy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It is so Zen like , the competition at the Olympic Games is only can be .
The qualification and finals of the women will be held on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming at 13 : 00 Eastern Time and the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days , starting at 14.00 .
In the midst of Olympic-mania , the promise of a quiet , nice Moment , one that is overlooked in the General hubbub probably .
If the Awareness-raising can only be through the Gapes and the object classification of male athletes - as it is the male American gymnasts , according to The Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Mr Dooley expects his air ring to the end of that new fan base .

Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
The RBS brand will be reduced according to the Chairman of the Board of the Bank on a back-office role .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be for customers outside of Scotland available .
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand associated with the global ambitions of the Bank .
The Bank has distanced itself since then , as you had to be collapsed eight years ago nearly , and saved .
In this time , brand strategists `` RBS have used '' to protect other consumer financial brands .
She supported the international Sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now she has decided to back more national brands in the focus .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be for customers in Scotland are available , but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all of the RSB references , the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest .
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other , smaller brands for the private customer business , which will get more importance - Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's Military Bank .
McEwan was during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire interviewed .
He told BBC Scotland : `` The brand of the RSB will be to our investors , brand and to the brand under which our employees , because we are now more and more a Bank of brands . ''
As the Bank was itself a global brand , was RBS 's global brand .
I say now , that we have no global targets but local targets .
Each of these brands in their own communities for something completely different , and our staff will work under these brands with the customers .
RBS has already said that it will not be Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
`` It is time for us to evolve to the Bank of the marks , because , as we focus on the Inside ( we asked ) to make this a better Bank for customers ? '' said the chief Executive .
It would have been three years ago , very cynical , if we had said that we would have for our customers a great Bank , and these brands launched .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , will see many changes .
We can launch these brands , therefore , I think that the time has come .

Kepler rotation measures the rate of stars in the Star cluster of the Pleiades
The latest Mission-the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers the most complete catalog of rotation rates to collect under the stars in the star cluster of the Pleiades .
The new data will help astronomers to understand why stars rotate in the Star cluster at different Rates , as well as the context in which the rotation periods of planet formation .
`` We hope that we will be told by Comparing our results with other star clusters , and more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of the solar system , '' Luisa Rebull , a research scientist at Caltech 's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The Star cluster of the Pleiades is located about 445 light years away from earth .
A lot of stars in this Star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adulthood .
Turning now to the fastest .
To launch top-of-the rotation rates of these Mature stars , large amounts of stellar winds .
As these winds by the magnetic fields of the star are traveling , you will have a brake effect on the stars .
When a star ages , it begins its rotation rate to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star , by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star-spots -- sun spots -- .
The latest catalog from rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars rotate slower pirouettes than smaller ones .
`` In the `` Ballet '' of the Pleiades , we see that slow rotors tend to be solid , whereas the faster the rotors will tend to be very bright stars , '' said Rebull .
Because the Star cluster of the Pleiades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities , such as rotation rates .
`` The Star cluster of the Pleiades provides an anchor for the development of theoretical models of the stellar Rotation in both directions , younger and older , '' said Rebull .
There is much still lies ahead of us , about what we want to know how the slow rates of How , when , and Why stars in their Rotation , and a sort of `` dance shoes '' to hang up .
Rebull and her colleagues have in three Newspapers report in detail on their latest analysis of the rotation of the Pleiades rates reported , will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal .

The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start .
In consequence , the WADA took Kenya to the list of the countries whose fight against Doping are compliant with the rules of the WADA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner Nation .
The athletes of the country won at the 2015 world Championships in Beijing , the most medals .
In a series of television of the ARD reports were always raised accusations that in Kenya , a Doping agent is easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of the sports fraud .

Five goals in two Games should be a memorable performance , but Bam ( 27 ) said that she could not remember ever having done .

I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
You know : The Americans are 4-0 in Olympic Competition and are neck and neck in their group with the British in the first place , after their 2-0 victory against Japan unbeaten .

Bam was part of this team .

The rights of the `` Identitarian movement '' has come to the attention of the Federal office for the protection of the Constitution .
After several land offices of the constitutional protection authorities have asked the Federal government , the group under observation .
`` We see in the case of the 'Identitarian movement ' evidence of efforts against the free democratic basic order '' , said the protection of the Constitution CEO Hans-Georg Maassen , the German press Agency in Berlin .
So immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East to be defamed in extremist way .
Therefore , we observe the movement now .
The `` Identitarian movement '' is a group with French roots , which is since 2012 also active in Germany .
It is directed against `` Multicultural madness '' , `` uncontrolled mass immigration '' and the `` loss of one 's own identity through Domination '' .
The Constitution protectors in nine Federal States of Bremen , Bavaria , Hesse , Berlin , Baden-Württemberg , North Rhine-Westphalia , lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - watch the `` Identitarian '' already .
Maassen said his Agency had coordinated with the decision closely with the country offices .
`` Groups such as the 'Identitarian movement ' to try , your audience is there to pick up where she stands , '' said the protection of the Constitution boss .
In General , extremists , and reach `` youth-friendly '' language , often with pop music .
Did Islamists as extremists .
This is not a betuliche advertising for the own business .
The Propaganda is designed to appeal to people emotionally .
Young people are in particular vulnerable .
This is dangerous .
Recently , there had been from several States , reports of contacts of the `` Identitarian '' AfD politicians .
Maaßen said that he had no knowledge .
For the protection of the Constitution possible contacts of this type are only from a certain point of relevance .
It depends on whether the party will change , in this case , the AfD by certain persons that are extremist , its purpose , and so extremist .
The decisive factor is therefore whether such individuals tax have influence on the party .
This was not apparent .
With a view to the significant increase in the number of right-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees accommodations , Maaßen said that he would not speak in this connection of the new right , terrorism .
But we have found in the past few years that it can give to terrorist structures .
There was the group of 'Old-School Society ' , or the free fundamental group .
It may well be that other legal terrorist groups or micro-groups , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives plan .
A Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not identifiable .
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Worried Maaßen said that many Assaults went on the account of people who were not previously entered into the right scene .
This gives us cause for Concern .
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been Criminals , and politically motivated offenders , or followers of the right scene .
`` Many people have committed offences that had before , with right-wing extremists , nothing in the hat , the were , perhaps , politically indifferent or , for example , the CDU , the SPD or the Left have chosen , have radicalized , however , by right-wing extremist propaganda '' .

Clinton 's and trump 's economic policies compared : It 's all about the money
In infrastructure investing , and the trade agreements TTP prevent the want to both Clinton as well as Trump .
Divided the two US presidential candidates are , however , tax policy and energy policy , as well as a question of principle .
The Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton , was a General , rather philosophical difference .
Of the , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep the software small , and warns how the government can damage the economy with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wool tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
He would himself , however , is quite different , says Trump .
He will go back to the regulations , solid , and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform , with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies .
Clinton , however , says : The state has to fulfill certain tasks , he has to give Disadvantaged opportunities and needs for money .
Therefore , the taxes would be increased for the Rich , she says .
Interesting , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
In the needed to be invested in , say , Trump and Clinton the same , almost word .
The democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second world war .
State investment programs in infrastructure are the classic democratic politics , and to be rejected by the state critical tea party wing of the Republican strictly .
To Trump so the party could face internal discussions .
More marked are the differences in the energy and climate policy .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and coal production in the United States .
Oil production should also be in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement he wants to terminate .
Clinton wants to expand their investment program , specifically the Renewable energy and calls for : `` A country will be the super power of the clean energy and millions of Jobs . ''
`` It will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be there . ''
However , not only in the infrastructure , even in the case of international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
TPP , the TRANS-Pacific trade agreement , not want to both sign .
At the same time both do n't want to isolate but the U.S. from the international trade - but just American Jobs .
Which should be paid better , asks about Clinton .
The current minimum wage of 7.25 dollars is a pittance .
It wants to increase to 15 dollars per hour .
What do Trump in this question is not very clear : Once he says : The minimum wage needs to go up , then he says that he ought not to be changed .
However , the big discussion in the coming months is likely to develop has more to do with the tax policies of the two camps .
On the one hand , Trump , who wants to relieve the burden on the economy and the citizens , in order to stimulate growth .
His critics hold him , so that the budget deficit would only get bigger .
On the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least to demand of the Rich that they pay more tax , and whose critics say : More taxes are the solution .

`` A Generation of protest '' in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia , met with a violent resistance to the government .
Witnesses say that tens of Protesters were killed in the move during clashes with the police when shot .
Is Ethiopia a break just to match ?
In the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West , with a fast-growing economy .
But in the last few months-torn protests against the government of the country , and expanded in more and more areas .
Last week , stormed thousands of people to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
The response of the government was , according to human rights organizations relentlessly .
Witnesses reported that police officers shot at dozens of unarmed protesters shot and killed .
In the circulation of Videos of the protests are believed to be from the last or beginning of this year , show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were compelled to do a Handstand against a wall .
The head of the UN 's Commission on human rights now requires a thorough investigation .
`` It has always been difficult for this country to keep together and in the future it will be even more difficult , '' said Rashid Abdi , the project Manager of the Horn of Africa , International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia to Nigeria , the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in order to combat terrorist threats beyond the Region , particularly in Somalia . Only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get as much help from the West .
Ethiopia 's economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital , Addis Ababa .
The roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
Even if Ethiopia was not a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the repression by the government - the Opposition in the country was restricted , where dissidents have been effectively Silenced .
Many were sent into exile or to prison , killed , or in the vast Expanses of the desert driven .
But that could change .
`` If you oppress people and they have no other options to protest unless it breaks , '' said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia .
All of the youth protested .
A Generation of protest .
There are numerous complaints , covering everything from land use to the stranglehold of Power of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and are now in control of 100 percent of the Parliament .
At the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea ; the jagged , controversial line called for in June , hundreds of lives .
Analysts fear that the separatists , such as the Oromo liberation front or the National liberation front in the Ogaden , which were defeated in the last few years , more or less , take advantage of the turbulence and could arm .
Several factors explain why feelings of resentment after years of to explode in front of Hinköchelns under the surface now .
The first seems harmless enough : Smartphones .
Only in the last years , a great many of the Ethiopians were able to communicate by means of social media , cheaper smart phones were becoming more common and the Internet improved services .
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter what you are doing at regular intervals , especially during protests , will be able to communicate a lot of people still on the Internet Proxies , which hide where they are .
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered to protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since Eons , prosper , the Amharas from Ethiopia containing predominantly Christian countries , in politics and the economy , while Stripping the Oromos , many of whom are Muslims , and in lowland areas of life .
But even that is changing .
`` We are to co-ordinate under one umbrella , '' said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of the Oromos .
The largest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by way of members of the ethnic group , the Tigray , which account for approximately 6 percent of the population and are in the military , in the intelligence services , in the trade and of the policy dominant .
The third reason for the riots was the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was until his death , at a non-public-made disease in the year 2012 for 17 years , Ethiopia 's Prime Minister .
He was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in the early signs of discontent and to use a special representative , to edit , to opponents and to make them harmless .
`` The current Regime there is a lack of this basic skill , '' said Mr. Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopia 's new Prime Minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , has been selected from a relatively obscure reasons , the position of Mr Meles .
Unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray Region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam is from the South .
Analysts say that he enjoys the confidence of the Tigray-controlled security services .
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed .
The last Time Ethiopia had experienced such turmoil in 2005 , after thousands against election protested , the were bungled , according to information from analysts appears to be from the government , and then stolen .
During the subsequent raids , many of the protesters were killed at the end , even if it were less than in the last few months , and this time the riots went by relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , as well as for its measurable progress in the fight against poverty .
But obviously , this has not prevented the intensification of internal resentment of the Ethiopian government .
And she takes on a dangerous ethnic Form .
Last month , protesters attacked the end in Gondar , Amharic , city of Tigray-run business , and the hatred towards to the Tigray is usual in the social media .
Analysts say that the protests will bring the United States and other Western allies in a peculiar Position .
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia , even if they recently announced that it has closed on this Basis .
While the West wants to give clear support to the democracy , he does not want that his ally collapses in an already volatile area .
`` This , '' said Mr Abdi , `` is a very thin tightrope . ''

31 years of exemplary clarity provided
The managing Director of the water purpose Association `` Veit stone group '' , Ruppert Göller , is retiring .
The Association is regarded as the `` Bavaria '' .
A small Franconian drinking water Association as a model for the large water producers .

The future of the Smelter at Portland due to cancellation of the power contract is questionable
The future of the aluminum melt of Portland in Victoria - as well as the hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake , as the plant operator to supply the energy contract terminate , and all supply contracts will pick up , as the supplying energy company announced .
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , to be awarded any further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
A 20-year subsidy runs out in November .
Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland .
Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk in the case of a closure .
In addition , there could be Domino effects , since the Smelter consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation in Victoria .
In 2014 , Alcoa completed the Point Henry Smelter , and what led last year to a closure of the Anglesea power plant .
The Smelter of Alcoa in Portland is losing money and the risk of a closure .
This step follows the year-long speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and , most recently , due to the price of Electricity for the plant .
AGL , the large aluminium smelter supplied with its Loy Yang A power station in the Latrobe Valley , announced that it expects three more owners will cancel their contracts .
The facility is located in the majority ownership of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina , of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japan 's Marubeni Corp to hold smaller shares .
`` AGL anticipates that the facility in Portland will continue to be operated , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the Smelter , '' the company said .
AGL said that the contracts were so-called `` hedging transactions '' that should occur would be November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12-month notice period , so you will end in 2017 .
`` Therefore , AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , '' said the electricity supplier .
All of the potential impact on revenue to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the predictions of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL announced that it had written down the value of the contracts already in its Annual financial statements in the amount of $ 187 Million in `` anticipation of termination '' .
Alcoa said that the decision to derecognise contracts to ensure the '' ability to Alcoa 's ... to operate the Smelter or the power supply to the Smelter '' affect .
The U.S. company said that it had completed in 2010 , a 20-year contract with Loy Yang , which should occur by November of this year would be in force , even if it is still a Declaration is guilty of , why it has withdrawn from the contract .
Analysts warn due to the bad economic condition of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland Smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle .
In reference to the statements of the analysts in the beginning of the week the Head of Operations , Stephen Mikkelsen , said that Portland annually consume around 600 MW , and Tomago , around 900 megawatts of electricity .
Both systems should disappear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in the demand on the [ electricity market ] .
And for us as a producer of electricity that would not be good , '' he said .

The method has proven to be effective and the honey guide Foundation , which had already , years ago , the idea has intensified with the US-protection of nature , your promotion by trained Volunteers in villages in the North of Tanzania , to use a four-step method for the protection of their homes and harvest without harming the animals .
Previously , many spears used to defend yourself .
Friday the world is elefantentag , which is dedicated to the protection of animals .
`` Since then , we have the ... developed Toolkit , we were able to observe within these municipalities , a Change in your attitude , where you are much more confident that you can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants , '' said the CEO of honey guide , Damian Bell in a message .
The first two steps include the Lighting of the elephant with a torch , and the blowing of a Horn .
If he is not quenched , it will throw a so-called `` cloud of Chili '' .
Chili powder mixed with soil is Packed together with a fireworks in a condom , the end of which is screwed to the fuse .
When it is fired , bursting the condom with a Bang and sprays a fine dust of chili powder in the air .
A hint of right in the rule is already out , to chase away the elephants .
A last possibility is a launcher , which shoots a gold rain fireworks in the air , and a loud , bright Explosion caused .

NASA climate model : Venus was once habitable
Venus was according to the projections of a new NASA climate model likely once habitable .
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies , NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus , on the basis of Tools and Algorithms that are similar to those of Climate scientists .
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have shown with your hot , waterless surface , and CO2-dense atmosphere of a once earth-like conditions .
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow Rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
But the latest Simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin atmosphere similar to earth 's , and still slowly turned .
The model also highlighted the topography of the early history of Venus .
The Planet was probably more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water , and geographic variability , to accommodate life and faster evaporation protected .
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
`` In the GISS model simulation Expo the slow Rotation of Venus returned to your day side of the sun for almost two months , '' said GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio , in a press release .
This heats the surface and produces the rain which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as a rain screen , the surface shield of a majority of the sun 's heat .
The result of average temperatures a few degrees cooler than that of earth today .
The model produced a history of the Venus , which is similar to the Evolution , which was previously suspected by planetary researchers .
Although it was probably habitable , was exposed to the Venus -- in the course of several billion years -- too much heat and ultra-violet light .
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away from the ultra-violet light .
As their Hydrogen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , the know how , we are today .
The researchers , the results of your new Venus climate model , announced in Geophysical Research Letters .

In his remarks to Putin , cited on the Kremlin Website , said Ivanov , `` it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 , in a conversation , to me this is very complicated Post - one might almost say arduous Post for four years .

As Putin came to Power , was he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most .
It was once believed that Ivanov could be Putin 's second term in office , President of Russia , since a third term in office , Putin would violate the Constitution .
But this Post was taken from another close ally of Putin , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin , the Prime Minister was before he was three and a half years later , President .

Old buildings , a couple of Linden trees , between a Rest cobblestone : The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain , at first glance , not so , however , the police is considered to be the `` Dangerous places '' in the city .
If one goes from East to West along , you will find playgrounds , a freshly painted nursery and a health food store .
On the facade of the grey house , someone has sprayed `` ugly ! `` .
Opposite a Lidl , which is also supposed to be soon demolished , will be built by 2017 here is a house with high Windows and 133 new rental apartments .
Article about this `` trendy '' as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain called , are illustrated in the last few weeks , however , preferably with burning cars .
Reason , the house with the number 94 is : Once it was occupied , in the meantime , the residents of leases have , on the ground floor are , however , still occupied space , and can be used for events .
Especially the Berlin interior Senator Henkel had spoken since the beginning of the year several times for tough action by the police against the project , the area as a `` No-Go-Zone '' for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of Autonomous violence .
After on 22 . June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kadterschmiede , had been cleared with the 300 police officers that patrolled the police for three weeks , the official said that 30 to 40 officers and three squad cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
Meanwhile , renovated a construction worker in behalf of the unknown owner of the house , the rooms .
13 . July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal , and a day later the police and the construction workers withdrew to the cheers of supporters and local residents .
On this summer afternoon , the street is peaceful : parents with children walking , people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk in front of the Späti .
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects , a primary school and kindergartens .
Left-wing violence is not the main of many residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who lives since 1999 in the neighborhood , and Jana* , the draws here are three children , concern , are annoyed especially by the police presence .
With the residents of the house projects you share concerns about rising Rents and gentrification .
It does n't sound like a neighborhood , the police wanted the majority of the protection against vandaliere Left .
The trench , the Berlin Senator for the interior and the police , occupants between the house and their neighbours open the door , so does not exist apparently .
Friedrichshain in former East Berlin , a traditional working-class district , which has today , compared to the Rest of the city with a low average income and high poverty risk actually was .
Also squatting , and the out-housing projects have long been the neighborhood in 1990 , a number of houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all of the Mainzer road in the vicinity of Riga .
During the Mainz squad under a great deal of police in a street battle had been cleared , many of the projects legalized in Riga , and are partly inhabited today by the people which they had occupied before the age of 26 .
At the same time , the district is in recent years increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berliner-by-choice from all over the world to become : With you local residents from the GDR now share-times and former squatter in their neighborhood .
This is also the case of the Rents , which have risen since 2009 , in the case of new leases to nearly 60 percent .
Many of the buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development : they have inserted slices or freshly painted facades that were thrown at bags with the color .
No other road was mentioned so often this year , together with the words `` left-wing violence '' .
One reason for this is that not all of the neighbors see this as a Problem , it could be that you are not affected by the crime : crimes such as personal injury are addressed according to statistics , almost exclusively against the police .
The largest part of the offences , damage to property , which tend to be more likely to make the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , who lives for 17 years in a tenement house , in addition to the controversial 94 , can be a uncertainty .
As for violence , it is uplifting : The people in the 94 are your neighbors , not all of them had been determined .
The famous burning of cars , it is not directly in the Riga .
For the studied architect your street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary , `` Here , help each other , living together on the road and gets more from each other than anywhere else '' .
Neugebauer is deliberately drawn in the Riga road and remained .
That 's why it was so important that the residents get their road back : the police , politicians and the media , which in July all of a sudden the sovereignty of interpretation claimed for the district .
However , in the eyes of residents , such as Neugebauer on the road is taken away from them , By faceless new buildings in former vacant lots , displacing the old inhabitants .
`` Yes , ultimately , ownership of dwellings , which are not for many people here , interesting people here who are not so well-heeled well- 'll be more , '' she says .
`` Violence and destruction , I ca n't countenance . ''
But what are you supposed to do when a never-someone is listening ?
As a on all sides of the Frustration , even the police and the residents .
For newcomers , the resent color bombs , Kerstin Neugebauer little understanding : The in-house projects and left the scene belonged to the neighborhood .
Who drags , you should be aware of this - just like someone who draws in a bar district , there are bad noise can complain .
All first names only featured people have asked to be with her correct name

Improved flow of traffic on the road
It jams regularly on the Beltway - here is a picture from November .
But that should change : The right lane is to be extended .
This is good news for all motorists in traffic on the surrounding road each evening in a traffic jam when you are driving on the motorway ( A 43 ) .
Landesbetrieb Straßenbau extended to next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16./17 . August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the departure Wesel road , the right lane about 700 meters .
Motorists can then thread directly from the Hammer road on the right .
The big advantage : The traffic is divided early , thereby reducing the overall flow on the busy section of the Federal route 51 is improved .
The idea with the extended exit of the CDU faction in the district representation of Münster-West .
The lane narrowing on the Shuttle is annoying motorists , especially between 17 and 19 o'clock .
On weekdays , goes to the backwater to the bridge over the use and sometimes .
Reason , the eye of the needle on the B-51 is just before the departure Wesel road .
From here , the traffic is directed to only one lane over the motorway bridge .
The second track had to be built in front of a good three-quarter years .
The reason is that Static calculations had revealed that the bridge has the required load-bearing capacity , especially the heavy traffic from two lanes to be incorporated .
How long this bottleneck and the associated work will continue daily traffic jam , say to the responsible use of the land .
However , it is to be expected : Because the bridge has a official remaining life up to the year 2034 .
For the extension of the right turn lane of the country has be aware of the traffic weaker time in the school holidays , selected , because , with disabilities .

Thai media wanted to detect the attacks , a pattern for the bomb attacks by Muslim separatists in the South of the country is typical .
The Thai police stated , however , that the attacks were in connection with the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism .

Increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) is true for the Rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial Referendum on a of of the military junta drafted the Constitution .
This gives the military great influence in the coming years .
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause Chaos , while the country is moving in the direction of stability , an improvement in the economic situation and the tourism .

Dettori sprays champagne after a Double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th win
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday .
He put on Predilection , which is trained by John Gosden , on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
The three -time winner Dettori , who won on Ghayyar before that , said : `` it 's something special . ''
I 'm very emotional because my family is here as well
I 'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago .
It 's not a big meeting , it 's not Royal Ascot - it 's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am relieved and very modest .
Dettori takes the cheer as he picks up victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20 -time winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the nine -time Derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it 's no surprise that he has reached that milestone , which few have reached in front of him .
He has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
He is a fantastic ambassador for race , his enthusiasm and charisma enthusiasts fans for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already picked up 6,000 profits if he was n't just a weekend and major tournament jockey !
Frankie has already had nearly 30 years of winners in GB , which is great .
He has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that , he 's an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finals to Flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades .
It was nerve-wracking .
A whole series of major tournament wins , including his famous `` glorious Sieben '' 1996 in Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
Three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form .
And he is far from at the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until his at least 50th year of life .

Disease case : when will the organiser pay
After their journey , diseased holidaymakers will only get money back if the cause of the disease can be found without doubt at the hotel .
However , this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests prove the same symptoms .
In the negotiated case , a family was severely ill on diarrhoea and eruption on the second day of their Turkish holiday .
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater .
The family felt that the journey had been flawed - and complained against the organiser .
In court , the plaintiffs had no success .
Although the treatment plant was in fact defective .
But the organiser only learned about it shortly before departure of the plaintiffs .
He had to assume by then that the sea water was in order .
So he did not violate his information obligations , according to the ruling .
Especially as no contaminations were found in the samples of the water .
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - is part of the general risk of life .
Of 691 guests , only 38 were ill .

Police : 3 victims shot in serial murder case at music hearing in car
According to police reports released Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in Phoenix 's first serial murder case while they were entertaining in the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in an entry , authorities said .
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while he was on the car 's front-passenger side and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
Police announced that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery , as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
Phoenix Sgt . Jonathan Howard 's police spokesman said the shooting was giving investigators a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks .
In total , seven people were killed and two others wounded in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks .
`` It happens in a residential area in front of a house , '' Howard told KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , earlier this month .
It is believed the suspect used several vehicles , including a brown Nissan from the late 1990 s , a black BMW from the late 1990 s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis ' daughter Maleah still died on the ground .
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty pickup truck half a hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial murderer .
Investigators found patron hulls and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room .

North East oil workers take talks again , set off strike
Labor struggles with regard to pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended , while all the parties to the dispute will get to the table for a new round of talks , negotiators said .
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
`` Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute , '' says a joint statement .
We will hold some all-day meetings in the next few weeks , which will begin early next year to readdress the problems .
Unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group this year cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
The company 's council cut follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014 .
The company said additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn .
Shell has sacked thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with UK energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had been reinforced by the British decision to leave the European Union in June .
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with worker leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
The North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
`` In the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for few , '' he said in a statement .
In 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : the first smartphone
Email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market .
The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
It was thicker and bigger , so it was not good either .
On the contrary , it was pretty kloy .
The built-in memory initially averaged eight megabytes , which would today be enough for roughly two selfies with high resolution .
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes .
The `` Nokia 9000 Communicator '' came to the shops exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone .
For a few€ , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the Communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as a `` office in the West End format . ''
In fact , the new mobile phone could be a lot for then : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax was the Communicator to reach .
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser , albeit slowly slowly .
A calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded up similar to a laptop .
Then found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen .
Quite proud was the price : 2700 D-mark , that is , about €1400 .
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was €392 in 2015 .
No one was able to guess in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
Since then , everything has been different .
The smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
The Finns `` mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and wrapped up .
Today , the market dominates the market , all of which came much later than Nokia .
Always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday .
In 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
Some 1.4 billion devices have been sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million pieces .
Global sales with the equipment are around €400 billion .
On top of that , the well running business of the countless app providers and the telecoms corporations .
Around the smartphone , a whole industry has now emerged .
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007 , at the time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac-World the introduction of the iPhones .
He promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communicator , easy to use all by touch screen .
Apple 's victory move began , still today the iPhone is the corporation 's most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , who dominated the market , had the aftermath .
They eventually disappeared , Blackberry has struggled .
The saga now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
On average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
`` We must all learn to put the smartphone away , '' said Janina Kugel , in the Siemens Board of Human Resources .
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
She is also a social worker on the ground .
Since July , Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach .
The Social Pedagogist supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger .
It sees itself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there , the ice-legged wool mill , which , above all , has a problem .
For example , some - less intense than the multitude of requests for tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the post .
An administrative power has been sought with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work , an ice-legged wool mill .
But administrative work is not their central area , says Annika Deuschle .
Above all , it is about organisation , work with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks .
It has a 50 percent limit on three years .
`` It was high time , '' says Regine customer , that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors .
There are big and small problems , organisational , human and understanding problems .
Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognised .
Local authorities are responsible for the connection .
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
The cost of the construction , rent or renovation of these shelters must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the Countess to the Commune and Jobcenter .
Problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
The search has been very difficult for some time .
De facto , the administration does not find private homes .
It has not worked so far , so it is necessary to rely on private housing , according to Deuschle .
That is why it is necessary to make public housing esteemed , as it is so beautiful .
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße .
But only with homes is it not done .
Perspective is the key word , are Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a firm bust , it is internships , training places , school places , one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be funded or set up .
`` More places would be good , '' reports Regine Customer .
Many work in the building yard or help house master , do non-profit work - and that motivates and very properly , as Annika Deuschle reports .
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive outlook .
This is `` no employment therapy . ''
However , activity does not just mean work .
The day needs a firm structure , say Deuschle and customer .
People would have to develop a sense of belonging .
So it needs offers such as sports , contacts with locals and , above all , language courses .
Professional courses are rar .
So , here too , administration and volunteers are jumping .
It is central that the refugees feel they are wanted and welcome in Germany .
The long duration of the procedures is a problem .
They must explain to the refugees that it is just that it takes and that they can bridge the time , for example , with language courses .
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he ca n't help anybody in Urbach should not work and be useless , who will never integrate .
The clear majority is motivated .
However , there is also a problem , says the customer , `` people who do nothing at all . '' The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others .
All this is a `` mammoth task . ''
A difficult question : have the two been afraid of radicalisation after recent events , including in a small community like Urbach ?
`` No , '' says Regine customer very clearly , `` what some may call naive . '' A residual risk can not and does not want to exclude them .
However , the helpers are already aware of this .
These incidents are also subject to refugees .
Those would have the fear that the offenders will bring them completely into disrepute .
`` They want to show that they have nothing to do with it , '' says Regine customer .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
So the main and honorary people on the ground and in the region must look for activities .
In doing so , they always have in the background that a new thrust of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach .
Does Germany need a ceiling ?
To answer this question clearly , politics is shy .
In fact , it is unfair to put them on the ground .
`` In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go , '' says Annika Deuschle .
No new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already in the process of being able to integrate the previous people sensibly .
These are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
But when people are in need , they have to help them , both women agree .
The political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .

Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable .
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer , with some colleagues , sought a bit of change with an exit on the beach .
For the 58 -year-old , it was a premiership .
Chio : `` golden sports pyramid '' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they jailed in the fast gallop home to the feedingstuffs .
One kilometre at that pace , I 've been scared .
`` It was not a good experience , '' says Langer .
And then the riding career ended again .
On Saturday , Germany 's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back near horses .
He left with his family over the plant of the ALRV , on a horse he did n't even swap for photo purposes .
Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO .
The reason was quite convincing .
The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala .
At awards , the sympathetic athlete is not lacking .
Federal Cross of Merit , Silver 's Lorbeerblatt , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
Even the British Queen has already adored him .
Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
In Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday .
`` This award means a great deal to me , '' says Langer , `` because it will be awarded not only for sporting success , but also for social engagement . ''
For decades , Langer has been promoting the offspring .
And so he also gave the prize money of €25,000 straight away .
With 15 other outstanding athletes , the dual U.S. Masters winner was admitted to the `` hall of Fame of German Sports '' on Saturday .
The exhibits include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt , the Turner Eberhard Gienger , the Father Cornelia Hanisch , Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt , the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe , Bob-driver Meinhard Ner , the Judoka Frank Wieneke , the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich .
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday .
After the official part , the illustrious society migrated to the Springstadion , where the Lavazza prize ran .
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals .

Treats wants nude calendars for `` women and for men ''
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970 s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017 .
But instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017 .
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from Oldschool-Playboys , since `` Playboy is for men . ''
I do that for women .
He seems to think that it does the calendars .
`` We need to return to the display of timeless and classic nudity , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , '' Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the calendar .
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .

Podolski attacks with `` Gala '' after Supercup
Hakan Sükr is a football legend in Turkey .
In Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükr .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
For the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is taking place in Turkey .
Before the duel of the arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : `` business as usual . ''
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the accident in July , the government begged that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected .
However , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , which is blamed for the coup attempt .
It does not stop at football .
Against the former Starkicker Hakan South , the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant .
As a result , South America , now living in America , is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sükr is said to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed by the state president , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , for the coup attempt .
Although the state of emergency , which was initially imposed for 90 days , still applies until October , in fact , this has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks .
The night `` democracy guards '' in public places across the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday .
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan .
Especially fans of the Besiktas working-class club are traditionally not among the president 's friends .
What unites the bulk of the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military coups .
Even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas .
In the case of gala winner `` Gala '' there will be a special return to Lukas Podolski .
His sporting value showed the Cologne in the past season : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31-year-old finished his first game time as his club 's top scorer .
In the final game against Fenerbahce , he scored the 1:0 victory .
The newspaper `` Fanatik '' joked him : `` he was the best in the place . ''
He has completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy .
Thanks to `` Poldi , '' the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion .
After the pre-run-k.o in the Champions League , the `` lions '' also differ in the Europa League early .
In the South Lig , it only ranged to rank six .
The season was not good .
The trophy was the only way to win something .
`` We did this and that is the most important thing , '' said Podolski .
For Master Besiktas , the game year ran better .
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez , who , with 26 seasons , laid the base for the 14th title as a South League goalkeeper .
That 's also the reason fans continue to hope for the 31 -year-old 's return .
At the same time , the Gomez , who was under the auspices of the AC Florence , and which was only borrowed at Besiktas , had announced that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
`` If Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , '' said the magazine `` Kicker '' club chief Fikret Orman .
In order to do this , however , the storm would have to be prepared to renounce around a third of its annual salary estimated at €7.5 million , and Orman made it clear : `` we can not pay his salary at Florence . ''

Trump does n't see the looming election defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
If there is nothing to do with the election to the U.S. president , Donald Trump already has an alternative video .
He then goes on holiday .
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November , it would be relatively irrelevant to him : `` ultimately it will either clap , or I have a very , very beautiful , long holiday , '' the Republican candidate said in a phone interview with the U.S. television broadcaster CNBC .
If it 's not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that 's fine , Trump said .
So he described U.S. President Barack Obama and the Democrats `` candidate , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the Islamic State ( IS ) .
Within his party , more and more resistance was formed .

Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS brand is expected to be reduced to a back-office role , according to the bank 's chief executive .
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank 's global ambitions .
The bank has since distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago .
During this time , brand strategists have used `` RBS '' to protect other end consumer finance brands .
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from Six Nations rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now it has decided to put more national brands in focus .
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all RSB references , the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will switch to NatWest .
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other smaller brands for retail banking , which will be more important - Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's Military Bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a sighting tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire .
He told BBC Scotland : `` the RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . ''
When the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became a global brand .
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals , but local goals .
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
`` It 's time for us to develop to the bank of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? '' Said the CEO .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see a lot of changes .
We can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

With the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Levan Dzhagaryan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year .
Since international sanctions on Iran were lifted , interest on the part of Russian companies in shops in the country grew sharply , the ambassador said .

In particular , Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5 % , and $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 % to $ 158 million .
The trade recovery has been achieved by supplies of machines , land vehicles and weapons , `` the ambassador said .
Dzhagaryan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
Last year , Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas , primarily rice evisas , to Iranian citizens .
Moreover , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
You could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are being broken last year , `` he said .
At the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
`` I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd , who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilisation in a good state , '' he said .

Tourists in Portugal panic after a tipping military jet beach overflowed
Sun worshippers in Aveiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portugal 's P- 3 C Orion plane of air forces put an incredible fall flight
Airstrikes said it was on a training flight but insisted that no security risk was ahead
This was the moment when scared tourists began to panic after a tipping jet crashed over a full beach .
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost within tangible proximity above the sunshine on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal .
The holidaymakers sprang up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the diet engines without first seeing what came through the clouds on them .
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media , said : `` it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash . ''
Nuno Arroja added : `` I was just on the surf and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . '
Tourists on Aveiro beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and was incredibly deep
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot of the P- 3 C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast , flying so deep that this was the only way to detect them .
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility conditions by nearby area fires , but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk .
Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people were killed on the island of Madeira .
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. baseball star in best days from Base to Base .
After his emotional resignation announcement , the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays .
`` I love this game and this team . ''
`` I say '' Goodbye `` to both , '' said the 14 -time All-Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Three times Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signature under a ten -year contract has given him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
By the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
As a player , it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance .
With 696 homeruns , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( `` runs '' ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones .
With the Hall-of-Fame-members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two other baseball players in key statistics show similar values .
But in the baseball 's glory hall , the 41-year-old is still unlikely to be included .
Because so successfully Rodriguez - nicknamed `` A-Rod '' - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
As early as 2009 , the superstar at `` ESPN '' admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 lots by the end of 2014 due to a settlement in the so-called biogenesis scandal .
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance-enhancing funds for years via an anti-aging clinic in South Florida .
After a legal battle , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
`` The league could even have done me a favor for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , '' Rodriguez said at the time .
Even his farewell days are not running smoothly .
While many baseball legends have been given the big stage again in their last games , Rodriguez has often had to sit on the bench .
`` My job does not include a farewell tour . ''
`` My job includes trying to win every game , '' said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and to the relationship with pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson , received sympathy from fans from the Yankee-arch-rival Boston Red Sox .
`` We want A-Rod , '' sang the supporters at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

Who is building Braunschweig 's cheap homes ?
The SPD and the Greens mean that investors should be given much more responsibility in the future .
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years ?
The SPD proposes a `` concept of action '' for the next Council meeting .
But contention is programmed .
First of all , the question is : who is supposed to build the cheap homes ?
There is no provision so far .
SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann says : `` we are in agreement with the Greens : those who want to build on urban areas will have to expel 20 % of all homes as social housing in the future . ''
However , the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock .
However , the big point of contention at the town hall is , according to Bratmann : `` how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? ''
`` We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such land , but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . ''
A new urban housing support programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be funded , is intended to provide incentives .
The problem , Mr Bratmann said , is `` there is no agreement at the moment between the political groups . ''
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible to investors .
The left wants even tougher conditions for investors .
Notwithstanding this , Mr Bratmann said , the situation in the housing market is tightening .
If the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
More staff are needed .
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
But the programme is not yet complete : the roughly 1260 new homes , which should be built anyway .
How , though , is the loss of more than 1300 cheap homes , whose support will be phased out over the next few years ?
By 2020 alone , it will be 500 homes .
To prevent that , according to Planning Policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm , expiring ties should now be purchased from the city .
In addition , consideration should be given to getting homes back into price fixing .
This is possible in the western city .
In one blow , the problem could be solved .
Because in the western city , deadlines run out at the end of the year .
About 1800 homes could be retrieved there into price fixing for cheap homes .
Only : that is what the owners , the housing companies , do not want .
If the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased , it will be removed from the objective of so-called meddling .
There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city .
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says : `` for a broad majority , the CDU must be on board . ''
This has focused on more building sites for single-family homes .
What does not mean , however , is that a compromise can not be found .

Jewish director shatters Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after `` Arab '' call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uproar after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli preselection as it had `` requested '' Arab guests , according to an employee .
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentary `` Shoah '' left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ .
During his last stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel 's list of countries .
However , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
Wrote Lanzmann .
Instead , the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center .
According to a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The answer he received there , `` shocked him , '' as Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel employee said that the measure was a `` deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski hotels . ''
The reason behind it was even more rage in the director .
`` Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted , '' the Lanzmann employee was quoted as saying .
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a `` great shame , '' the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports .
We were appalled and dismayed by this event .
This is really very shameful .
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more disgraceful .
This does not require any explanation .
We expect the hotel to `` draw the right conclusions , '' the official said .
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the internet where people called the whole thing a scandal .
Some subjected the Kempinski Hotel to the alleged demands of Arab guests .
`` Shame you , '' said another post stating that the hotel , located on the noble Kurfürstendamm , is close to a synagogue .
The hotel quickly dismissed all the accusations of itself and called the incident a `` provided '' and `` apologised '' at Lanzmann , reports The Mirror .
`` There was never a direct instruction '' not to include Israel in the fast-track list , `` the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel .
It adds that the country preselection has now been added .

Russia 's Putin fired chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly sacked his chief of staff , Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov was part of Putin 's closest confidence circle for many years .
The 63-year-old has been appointed a special envoy for environmental and transport matters .
In an opinion from the Kremlin , it is that , without giving reasons , Putin `` ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . ''
Anton Vaino , who has been Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo .
On the Kremlin 's website , it says ( in Russian ) that he was later protocol chief and chief executive of the government staff .
On his appointment , he said to Putin : `` thank you for your confidence . ''
I think that it is the government 's most important task to support your work as head of state on draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
Convince the smiling faces ?
This move has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin 's closest confidants and works like he did for the Soviet secret service , the KGB .
As a chief of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
At a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request .
But despite the smile for the cameras , here are few convinced - especially now , just before the general election .
So , is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
Nobody knows that at the moment .
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president at once would want to guide Russian environmental policy - came to great scepticism .
In his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Kremlin 's website , Ivanov said `` it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to entrust burdensome posts for four years .
As it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov took the post in December 2011 .
Previously , he was deputy prime minister and defence minister .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the state security service KGB .
In the late 1990 s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , who replaced the KGB , Ivanov was appointed to his deputy .
When Putin came to power , he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most .
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin 's second term , as Putin 's third term would have violated the Constitution .
But this post was taken by another , nearby ally of Putin , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later .

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and `` title defender '' Zhang Jike 4:0 ( 12.5,4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in an one-sided final .
As a result , the world class first picked up the `` golden Grand Slam '' with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Final Tournament and Olympia .
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani .
The two Chinese , as expected , got into the final game and made the title of each other .
So it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five Rings .
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic stairwell was former SVS NÖ-legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea .
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone , between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches at themselves .
They had withdrawn to the grandstand and left their shooters alone in the fair competition .
`` The matches to here I played for my country . ''
`` In the final I play for me , '' Zhang had said folly .
After the match , gold and silver medal winners with the China flag .
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided .
Ma had only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set .
After that , he determined the pace at the plate , leaving Zhang with only a total of 13 points .
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected matching match .
But , nevertheless , there were plenty of breathtaking ball changes to be seen .
Mizutani won the game around bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1 .
In his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov , the Belarusian had suffered a rib injury , after which he was in medical treatment , had to `` ultimately '' settle with bleach .
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner ( 38/2004 ) and Jörgen Persson ( 42/2008 ) were , by the way , in similarly high table tennis Olympia-Fourth .

More than just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of U.S. Vogue .
Kendall , who is a brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday .
`` In a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to the wine , '' Kendall wrote .
The cover 's revelation followed a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar ? ) , scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family ( except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn , as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn : they have all planned a surprise party .
This represents the cliched action of almost every birthday episode of a child 's broadcast ( Seacrest brought the phrase , `` you thought that we would have forgotten you ? , '' with the honesty of a cartoon canine on a transmitter at 8 in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow .
With regard to the September edition of Vogue , a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun .
Kendall 's big sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue-cover is concerned ( she and her husband Kanye West were seen on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue .
With an amount that resembles an image band rather than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( Laut Fashionista was of the 832 pages of the roller 615 pages advertising ) .
The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the past two years images of the magazine have been sickened even before the official announcement .
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In recent years , there have clearly been more `` celebrities who are modeling '' than `` models , the celebrities are '' on the cover .
Oscar winner and dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady Gaga had the honor .
But even with the low chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the `` breakthrough model '' of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video ( even if it 's all on Jenner ) .
They are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade .
Of course , Jenner 's success does n't like everyone .
With her reality TV story , Jenner 's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense .
In June , the former Victoria 's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them `` the mistes of the moment . ''
Those feelings boiled again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover .
But the point seems to be on the point of displeasure .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue .
She is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel .
She runs for Marc Jacobs .
It makes advertisements for your grunting of Estee Lauder .
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall-apps .
She sells from her made pictures of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to the journal LOVE .
And in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV , probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children .

Donald Trump admits there are tremendous problems ″ in campaigning
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive worries about losing their majority in traditionally conservative states .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republican high of Utah .
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-assured multimillionaire expressed something like concerns , as correspondents reported .
Having thrown 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race , the doubts are now growing about his success in the battle for the White House .
`` We have huge problems in Utah , '' Trump said before evangelical Christians he asked for support in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
Guilt were false reports of his candidacy , he resumed his well-known media outlets .
Republican high bursts waking up
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Republicans .
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June , Trump and his competitors were equal to the Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
Other institutions see Trump ahead , but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk .
In an interview by the broadcaster CNBC , Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton 's advance again : `` just as I have done so far . ''
And afterwards : this will be `` either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . ''
He is not doing anything other than `` telling the truth . ''
If it 's not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that 's fine , Trump continued .
Then I return to a very good way of life .
According to press reports , the party should have threatened Trump to remove funds in support of his campaign , should he not be able to present better polls .
Instead of that , the Republicans `` candidates for Congress are more likely to get to grips with it .

Woman in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
Police are calling on witnesses after a woman was overturned in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud just after midnight .
A woman put herself in the dark `` in an act of despair '' and was hit by several cars , police said in Vaud .
It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was overrun by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
She still died on the ground .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said , urging these as well as any witnesses to the incident to sign up .
An investigation has been opened , which is a `` logical '' step in such a situation , Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
Was a collision avoidable ?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide , `` said Hofstetter .
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable .
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists would not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night , as was said in the newspaper .
Last year a policeman was acquitted of negligent killing after she had overrun and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014 .
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has become unconscious on the street , the court heard .
The court found that the policeman -- who had replied to an emergency call -- drove in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a `` completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation , '' the judge said .
Anyone who has more information on Thursday 's incident near Morges should contact police at number 021.644 83 46 or 021.644 44 44 .

Data cloud : so perfide blackmailed hackers their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America , Britain and Germany , 40 percent of firms surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software .
In Germany , almost 20 percent of firms were already the target of a ransomware blackmail .
40 % of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators to reuse the systems and data that were attacked .
The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software , according to the observations of Malwarebytes , on attacks in corporate networks .
If they are successful there , the potentially blackmailed ransom is significantly higher than for private users .
`` We are currently watching a frighteningly rapid evolution of the malware , '' explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the `` world . ''
In 2008 , most malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves .
First , private users were the target , but the switch to corporate attacks has been terribly fast in recent months .
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim 's computer , she is looking for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
These files encrypt the ransomware and extinguish the originals .
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers .
To get the end key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin .
However , where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is closed .
Accordingly , the damage occurs when a ransomware beats .
22 percent of the German companies affected reported revenue losses by Ransomware , and 13 percent had to completely interrupt business , and in one case , people were in danger of life .
In Germany , hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of sickness .
`` We always say to the victims : do not pay , it only promotes the problem , '' explains Kleczynski .
But 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay will get their data again .
For managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in the operation .
The hackers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , F-Secure 's security researchers examined user surfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by bitcoin , set up freely accessible support websites , or decrypt example files .
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred€ , companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five -digit sums to get their data back unencrypted .
Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from ransomware blackmail , the hackers are becoming increasingly professional and sharing the work , explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos : `` a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week . ''
It is more likely , however , that these are three or four people .
The programmers then sell their software in the form of a software construction box to the actual blackmailers .
The previous malware kits created by buying the malware itself , counselling and additional tools for an one-off , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
`` Included is an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , looks and branding can be changed , '' says Wisniewski .
The blackmailers then seek further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
So you log in to one of the forums in the bottom , buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
Payment is made per infected computer .
`` Usually , the criminals then charge spammers with spreading , '' explains Wisniewski .
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data .
More than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to resist ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software .
Accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
`` If the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful expediency , the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , '' explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski .
As a result , the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is still many times higher than before .
In the future , the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the Internet of Things .
At the Defcon hacker conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control .
In the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom .
If the perpetrators then block a whole production road in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ransomware could also become an issue in the industry in 4,0 .

The depressing food of the economic crisis in `` an abundant meal ''
In March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
As a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup .
His menu that day was slightly more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato purple and as dessert a plum pudding .
`` It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , '' said Jane Ziegelman .
Her husband Andrew Coe added , `` it was also a message to Americans how they should eat . ''
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coes ' last book , `` Chop Suey , '' handled from Chinese cuisine in the US , while Ziegelman was told in her book `` 97 Orchard '' about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
Her latest collaboration , `` a decent meal , '' which will appear at Harper Verlag on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg 's Sandwich shop for dinner , a small , snarling snack in the Flatiron District , which has already been in store since the 1929 stock market crash .
Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive groves , while Coe , 57 , had Truthahn with potato purple and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered hackbrats , this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
`` Rich foods were very popular , '' said Ziegelman .
There was earth bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
They were prepared from an ingredient and something billionaire that stretches the ingredient .
Imagine eating so many Earth nuts that they serve them as dinner .
Coe grinned .
`` It must have been in the stomach like lead , '' he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household , especially in rural areas .
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
It was the Americans who , during the first world war , sent food to starving Europeans . `` A Square Meal '' sets out the ways in which the country could no longer be the country of origin .
`` It was a time when food was a central , tense issue for Americans , '' Coe said , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
Just as tense was the new budget diet : mysterious dishes such as bread and casserole became basic foods , the casserole as a `` wonderful way of restoring eating remains , '' noted bricks , as chefs were able to hide unappetising ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
Meat , which was the centrepiece of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
Peculiar mixtures were tried , as a calorific and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind .
During their search for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with earth nut butter .
`` It was not a popular addition at lunch , '' says Coe .
Brick man continues : `` it was surreal . ''
Nut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
It was typical for many of the house economic recipes .
As never before , or ever since , household economists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 - 1943 - have been doing the country 's eating habits .
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become `` household politicians '' and meet the challenge of turning pamps like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
`` A Square Meal '' is a celebration of historical delicacies .
In particular , the reports of the government 's response to the starving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoovers ' Lass-Mich-Kuchen-Essen-attire , are very palatable .
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like the millionaire man of world to which he has become .
`` He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce , '' said Coe .
He was in an almost gold-plated dining room and was wearing a smoke .
He was gloriously alien to reality .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach .
As described in the book , the arrival of a householder with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most dismal. ``
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was discarded once the country came back on its feet .
The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , Ziegelman said , as well as how science was applied to food .
The pair gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman 's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example , how she could n't throw food away .
`` She had a real fear of wasting food , '' said Coe .
Ziegelman remembered : `` she actually made people sick . ''
There was the windbag incident .
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg 's , they and Coe drew a dessert that they had prepared at home : the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had at lunchtime .
`` It is called Prune Whip , '' said Ziegelman , adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name .
There was no bearded cream , just plums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Each one appeared somewhat reluctant a spoon in the tough , brown Glibber .
Amazingly , it did n't taste bad .
Coe picked up a surcharge three times .
Like a Can-Do budgeter , he said to his wife , `` a few hacked walnuts would help . ''

Russia and Turkey : a `` alliance of outsiders '' ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions .
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can not deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
There was the handshake , yes .
But Putin 's smile worked narrowly and he barely radiated warmth , even for his restrained conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his `` dear friend '' Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I could n't count it any more .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis level , but will even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if there had never been anything bad .
It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
But a Sustainable Killed , sparked by Putin , showed that Russia 's head of state had forgotten nothing .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the shutdown of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow 's response at the time was wrapped up .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
The offence was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend .
Rebuilding the vetting will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , the government-controlled media carried out a fierce , unrestricted attack on Ankara .
At once , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan 's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State .
He has vehemently denied this .
But in St.Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan , who he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to make a kind of victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire are clear .
Erdogan needs in the first place all the friends he can get after he was unveiled last month at a failed coup d `` état almost his office .
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
The number has decreased by almost 90 % .
In Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed .
They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
This week , state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows : `` tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response .
On top of that , the persistent resentment is about the snail 's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey 's relationship with the West .
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup d `` état .
This is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change .
The summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray one , as one analyst once described to me , `` alliance of outsiders '' : two countries that feel the West and feel badly treated and now allied .
Nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It could be telling that after nearly three hours of initial talks both presidents said at the press conference that they would n't even have stripped the issue .
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize it .
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found .
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again .

Assistant doctors strike : calls for new workplace action
Deputies of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new workplace measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
The Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has called for its entire council to approve more work measures from the beginning of September .
The JDC said that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns about the Treaty .
Assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA in July .
It was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said the government had remained `` persistently quiet '' to problems , resulting in the contract being rejected .
She said : `` in view of this , the JDC Board of Directors has voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to call for official renegotiations on all of them . ''
In response to the government 's silence , the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating workplace measures that begins at the beginning of September .
The disputes led to assistant doctors striking six times this year , the first overall outages in the history of the NHS .
The head of BMA assistant doctors Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract , which had been recommended by the BMA .
He informed BMA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted .
After the vote , the Health Secretary , Jeremy Hunt , said the contract would be forcibly introduced for doctors in England .

Why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
That 's what I imagine under the women 's Olympic team in the turf , and that 's for more than one reason .
First of all , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant .
And second : this team has three turners-up , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren `` Laurie '' Hernandez , who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour .
The structure of this team , the Aly Raisman , who is Jüdin and Madison Kocian , who is Catholic , makes everyone proud .
This team is finally reflecting the US .
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
In the last four years , the number one among the female turner has been an Afro-American .
Last year were Simone and Gabby\ HASH 1 and\ HASH 2 .
That shows strength .
At the last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered .
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymastic routines .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We are seeing the top of this sport , but that 's not how turf classes across the country look like .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team .
They are the `` last Five , '' because the next Olympics will only have four female players in the team , and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer .
But the reality is that turkeys are an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private turf clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for the training , set-up , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their turners and families ) .
The majority of these turf clubs lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
In these clubs , the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , trainer of Laurie Hernandez , have both trained their athletes since they started playing with the turkey .
We need to give the communities countless , young girls inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie a more affordable and more accessible turf training .
I founded my turnstile of 20 years .
At my events , we have offered free and affordable turkeys in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and Hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
In September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high quality turkeys that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Turnen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the spirit .
This combination offers life-long benefits for health , as well as for school and professional success .
It 's the inspiration of this team that causes thousands of young girls to be interested in the turf and that 's great .
It 's so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
This is such an exciting time .
Thanks to Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of `` Girl Power '' by the Holen of the Olympic team and thank you so many young girls with different background motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

Seriously injured - man sticks to his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked and seriously injured his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife .
As police said yesterday , the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
Instead , the alcoholic offender cut the clothing of his ex-girlfriend .
When this one came into the apartment , he stole on her twice .
The 44-year-old was injured at hand and on the body .
Police were able to arrest the offender .
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend 's clothing , he called his mother .
This then alerted his sister .
Together with her life companion , the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother .
However , she could not persuade him to leave the apartment .
That 's why she walked out of the house with her life companion .
On the road , they met the man 's ex-life companion .
When the two women re-entered the apartment , the 50-year-old shuffled his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend .

What to have the Jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken out via Facebook to the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis .
In December 2014 , he first picked up gold at the short world championships in Doha , while at the same time setting up his first world record .
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protective of his ex-team-mates in the critique .
`` In a country where an Olympic champion gets £20,000 premium and a jungle 150,000 Euroshould no one wonder about missing medals , '' the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday .
The support system in the swimming pool is bad , but the doping controls are very good .
This will not allow us to compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the issue of doping or even operate it .
`` I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here , '' he continued .
If he wanted to start a comeback , Deibler would already have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency ( NADA ) .
That is exactly how we should keep it with countries .
`` Anyone who can not be controlled for some time before WM / OS by independent inspectors of WADA / FINA is not allowed to participate , '' says the electoral hamburger , who now runs an ice cream .

The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee is demanding punitive interest rates from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : `` it 's only about 139 customers who park 40 million€ on giro- or daily money accounts . ''
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an isolated incident and sees no sign that ordinary savers would `` not be afraid to pay for their savings banks . ''
Camps banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate .
This fee will require Raiffeisenbank Gmund to return from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than €100,000 on giro- or day-money accounts from September .
`` The first €100,000 is free . ''
`` The next 100,000 will cost €400 a year , '' said Paul .
He has been wary of €40 million for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he can not use .
`` These are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , '' the bank chief said .
`` I can not go for every million €4000 . ''
According to the polluter pays principle , the costs will now continue .
It would be far too dangerous to leave the cash in the Raiffeisenbank 's safes : `` I have already seen four falls , I do not want the fifth ! '' Said the bank board .
Most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .
Few migrated to other banks .
The Cooperative Society of Bavaria said : `` the ECB 's extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs for all banks . ''
To carry them on their own is `` not economically viable . ''
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or remittances .
With penalty rates for deposits from three million€ , the Thuringian People 's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with their Skatbank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kemmer , chief executive of the Banking Association , said : `` we do not expect private customers to have to pay for deposits for deposits , and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong . ''
A banker said that at the Tegernsee there is `` a clientele that is a little more fitted by the fortunes . ''
`` This can become a problem for a small bank '' if it hurts money for free .
Founded in 1911 , Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach-Egern , Kreuth and Tegernsee .
In the region , well-known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live .
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria `` is not currently aware of any other banks that calculate an outlay for deposits of private customers , '' spokesman Ernst said .
The president of the Federal Association of German People 's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken ( BVR ) , Uwe Fröhlich , declared at the end of June : `` the threshold to go to the negative towards the private client is very , very high . ''
The competition is tough , and it threatens the brain drain to compete .
Customers in Germany will not let this happen in width .

Municipal centres have 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country 's aid figures are dismissed annually by the municipal centres , while the industry is looking at the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions .
In Queensland , three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for unjust delusions and similar - are dismissed in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
Legal services of the community , which are already overly exploited , are ready for further cuts .
From June next year , it is envisaged that these legal centres will lose another 30 % of their federal funds .
The director of community law centres of Queesland James Farrell said the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being dismissed every year .
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government 's decision .
`` Queensland 's municipal centres are chronically underfunded , which means that thousands of people are dismissed from important services you need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crushing debt , families who go through separations , workers who have been unfairly sacked - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need .
The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
We call on the General Public Prosecutor and Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in legal problems .
Last year , the state government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal centres and their customer communities , and that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work .

Beautiful in Bargteheide - man shoots on lifeline
A 35-year-old man shot to his partner at 10,45 p.m. on Friday at a multi-family home in Bargteheide ( County Stormarn ) and fatally injured her .
`` The man himself has called with us and indicated that he was shot dead , '' a police spokeswoman said .
The perpetrator is on the run , after he will be publicly punished .
Now nationwide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
The man is about 1.80 feet tall , muscular , brown and has a gossip .

It is a few years old , however .
Meanwhile , the man is wearing a gossip .
The man is not expected to be addressed directly .
He can still carry the weapon , according to police .
Those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
The police are talking about a `` pronunciation . ''
The victim was born in 1988 , the culprit in 1981 .
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to make any claims about the Tathergang or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a person had been killed .
`` It is a killing offence . ''

According to eyewitnesses , a special intervention command ( SEK ) was at the scene .

Building ground in double pack
With issues around construction , the local council has been focusing on the most recent meeting .
With relief , the body noted the communication from Mayor Robert Putz that `` finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . ''
After the plot , parenting and development issues have been clarified and applications for surveying could be made , the sale of the land in the residential areas `` road '' and `` Schönau-West '' ( area Binderstraße - Exhibition section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
The local council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau are addressing young families and rugged seniors alike .
As it was said , from now on , builders can report themselves at the town hall , on the award of the parcels the local council is expected to advise in its September meeting .
In order to be able to comply with questions relating to the setting-up of other commercial enterprises , together with the creation of jobs , the local council decided to amend the land use plan , which was only re-established in the spring of this year , in sub-areas .
For example , in the area of subtime , the commercial area already designated there is extended by two parcels towards State Road 2112 .

The right-wing `` identitarian movement '' has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
According to several national offices , the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also put the group under observation .
`` We see in the '' Identitarian Movement `` evidence of aspirations against the liberal democratic basic order , '' said constitutional chief Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
In this way , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being defamed in an extremist manner .
That is why we are now watching the movement .
The `` identitarian movement '' is a grouping with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
It is opposed to `` multicultural madness , '' `` uncontrolled mass immigration '' and the `` loss of its own identity by foreigners . ''
Constitutional protesters in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden-Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the `` identitaries . ''
Maaßen said his authority had voted closely with the national offices in the decision .
`` Groups like the '' Identity Movement `` are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , '' said the constitutional chief .
In general , extremists try to address them with youthful language , often with poppy music .
The Islamists as well as right-wing extremists .
This is not a beguiling advertisement for one 's own cause .
Propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally .
Young people are particularly vulnerable .
That is dangerous .
Most recently , there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the `` identitarian '' to AfD politicians .
Maaßen said he did not have any findings to do so .
For constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view .
What matters is whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - will change its direction and become so extremist by certain people who are extremist .
What is crucial , then , is whether such individuals have a steady influence on the party .
This is unrecognisable .
Looking at the significant increase in right-wing offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters , Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context .
But we have noticed in recent years that there can be right-wing structures .
There was the group `` Old School Society '' or the Freital Group .
It may well be that other right-wing groups or micro-groups are forming that plan attacks against asylum-seekers , refugee homes or attacks from other far-right motives .
However , a German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognisable .
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Worried about the fact that many assaults went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
That is the cause of concern .
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene .
`` So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists , who may have been politically indifferent , or who , for example , chose CDU , SPD or Left , but who then radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist mood . ''

Troops backed by U.S.-backed troops say they have reclaimed full control of Manbij from Islamic State
Troops backed by the U.S.-backed troops have reclaimed full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters left in the city , a spokesman for the group said on Friday .
The Democratic Forces of Syria ( DKS ) , after the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city , are currently the city .
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the militants , Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council allied with the DKS told Reuters .
`` The city is now under complete control , but we are just carrying out clean-up work , '' he told Reuters .

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : `` go where it hurts ''
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : the locals do n't get anything from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , they understood .
In 2021 , the country 's election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
After all , this is not the case : summer holidays , heat and council campaign - that is what is happening .
The locals , who are to be persuaded by the campaigners , are on holiday .
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country , on Usedom , Rügen or Hiddensee , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country day .
In addition , there are practical problems : in the holidays , helpers who hang up posters , blow up air balloons , distribute flyers , and end up counting voices , are only laborious .
Until September 2016 , 4 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet to pass election campaigns just over the people .
The hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
And it 's also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , has to fear for his post .
The SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU in polls .
Thrilling will be how strongly Neuling AfD cut off and what 's left coalition dust at the end of the day .
Sellering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , is making an almost inconspicuous campaign , you see from his large posters .
He travels through the land , distributes roses and ploughs a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did .
Otherwise , Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame at the bloom of the AfD .
Her refugee policy , her `` we create this '' has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office .
The CDU with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier , has already seen how it is when you are campaigning in the right place at the wrong time .
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies ; Merkel Bundestag is located in the northeast .
But the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine-Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern .
`` There was probably the majority from other federal states , '' said Vincent Kokert , Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , recently in the NDR .
But it is also a pity to no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
Otherwise , the north-east CDU largely waives the usual campaign levels on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and air balloons .
This , Kokert says , only plays a `` subordinate role . ''
The Union , too , has noticed that it is breaking the ground in the countryside , that it must make a great effort to find a wire to the people again .
It is like the Left , the SPD , the Greens : there is little in the way of the country .
However , the council of CDU campaigner Kokert to his co-workers is also self-evident : `` you have to go where it hurts , namely where the people are : village , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . ''
Because much is at stake , Sellering has now called for his SPD to be a particularly committed election campaign .
In polls , the Social Democrats last stood at 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and just just before the AfD ( 19 ) .
In the 2011 election , the SPD had still clearly won at 35.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , small party with seven percent in the polls , are likely to create the leap into the land day .
They make a modern virtue from the holiday distress , and largely move their campaign to the Internet .
`` Online campaigning , '' it calls the national chairman Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green campaigners will go on trace search for local voters among holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , the top candidate , is curvy with a pet boat through the mecklenburgic lakes and still finds it beautiful .
Your impression : `` election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment . ''

Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt 's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association 's officials , but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him .
In July , Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract , saying that the NHS would be in a `` no-man 's land '' and that any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients .
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the chairman of the BMA Committees for Assistant Doctors , announced last night in a communication : `` assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and admit it will treat all doctors fairly . ''
At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time is running out .
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes by conversations joined the government on reluctance to participate , and sometimes on deafening silence .
That happened to a promise made by Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door would always be open .
`` Jeremy Hunt must act now , lift the stir and address the concerns of assistant doctors . ''
Should he not do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work measures .
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to grant cover to doctors on the strike pocket chain .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the British Medical Association 's officials .
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , director general of the NHS staff , urged assistant doctors to end the strike .
Mortimer said : `` work measures do not achieve anything of the very little , but already overburdened teams and service providers , and only cause concern , distress and disruption to patients , carers and their families . ''
Over the past two months , we have spoken to the Committees of Assistant doctors and have responded positively to concerns about the guardianship and whistleblowing with the Department of Health as well as other ministries .
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from a professional outbreak , training kits , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was for employers , the Health Education England and the Department of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November , February and May .

One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan .
Sounds quite overloaded , but the HR-V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , is actually proving to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small , passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the fond , it does n't work tight at any point .
The materials of the interior are well processed and pleasant , only the cockpit upper side comes down .
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
There is not only a boot of 453 l at the top and 1026 l at refolded back , but there are the `` magic Seats . ''
This is less magical than it sounds : the seating areas of the backbench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer closet space , which is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceilings .
The boot can be loaded well , but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
The tested 1.6 -l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .
However , he is likely to do his job a little more quietly .
The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
There is another motorisation : a 1.5 l gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp .
An all-wheel drive is not offered .
Driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamism and comfort .
The steering , however , is likely to be a little more direct .
The equipment in the tested top variant `` Executive '' leaves nothing to be desired .
The security systems include the City-emergency brake assistant ( works up to Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the track record assistant .
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he rated many obstacles as `` approaching objects . ''
The remote light assistant works very reliably .
And the intelligent Temporegler responds to the traffic mark recognition and drops the speed if needed .
The full connectivity , however , exists only for the top equipment : 7 -inch touchscreen , Navi , app integration and more .
Two USB- and HDMI bookings are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach .
The around €29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel are in order .
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from €20,000 , the diesel from €23,000 .
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard .
With the HR-V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .

Olympia 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught : due to a positive doping test , weight theater Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases .
A caught athlete would have won almost a medal .
Before the seventh competition day , the first official doping cases have become the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000 -metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight theater Adrian Zielinski have been tested positive and ruled out in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics contests , these messages come to an end .
At Chen last Sunday , the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was proven to be used as a masked means for doping substances .
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time .
On Sunday , the 18-year-old had ranked fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen should have attended the precincts over 50 m free style .
Chen has requested the opening of the B probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
The national association takes the matter `` very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations , '' Xinhua quoted from a communication : `` we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment . ''
For the first time in history , the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases .
Also on the night of Rio sickened the news about the positive probe at Danekowa , the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself .
`` I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , '' this was `` an incredible shock , '' she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT .
She is innocent , `` the only explanation could be food supplements , '' said the athleticist .
According to the report , the banned substance should be the blood doping instrument EPO .
Danekowa has been suspended provisionally , according to BNT , the B probe is also expected to have been positive .
Bulgaria 's prime minister , Bojko Borissow , immediately voiced criticism of the Athletin .
`` I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , '' he said , `` we Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . ''
For example , all weight theorists from the chronically doping nation may not participate in Rio .
On Friday , the case of `` Adrian Zielinski '' was also known , the London-based Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested positive to the anabole steroid Nandrolon three days earlier .
Both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
Before the launch of the athletes , especially the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
The International Federation of IAAF had banned the complete Russian team , except for an exception due to systematic doping , and Kenya also produced a lot of bad news in Rio .
In swimming sport , the previous offences in China had also ensured fierce clashes between the athletes .
So the Frenchman , Camille Lacourt , attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly .
`` Sun Yang pinches purple . ''
`` When I see the podium over 200 m free style , I want to surrender , '' Lacourt said on French radio .
Sun was also at the heart of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton .
`` I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters , '' said this .
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulus trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese championships , but had to sit down only a three-month lock .

At first glance , the Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work like this , but the police are one of the `` dangerous places '' of the city .
If you go down the road from the east to the west , you will arrive at playgrounds , a freshly deleted nursery and a biolade .
To the facade of a grey house , someone has sprayed `` ugly ! ''
Compared to a Lidl , which is to be demolished soon , it is already being built : a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be created by 2017 .
Articles about this `` trendy district , '' as the relevant real estate company Friedrichshain calls it , are , however , preferred in recent weeks with burning cars .
The reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have lease contracts , but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events .
In particular , since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior senator , Henkel , has argued several times for a tough action by the police against the project , calling the area a `` no-go zone '' for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence .
After on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor , the cadtersmiths , had been cleared with 300 police officers , police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on the ground , locked up parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
Meanwhile refurbished construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the rooms .
On July 13 , a Berlin administrative court ruled that clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers moved under the cheer of sympathisers and residents .
On this summer afternoon , the road works peacefully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun , others entertain themselves in front of Späti .
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects lie a primary school and nursery school .
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in the Kiez since 1999 , and Jana * , who has three children here , are mainly generous from the police presence .
With the residents of the house projects , they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification .
It does n't sound like a Kiez , who wanted a majority of police protection against vandal left .
The ditch that the Berlin interior senator and police make up between house occupiers and their neighbors does not appear to exist .
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district , which today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city .
Home occupations and the housing projects that have been born have also long been part of the Kiez : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainz street near the Rigaer .
While the Mainzer had been cleared under great police force in a real street battle , many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalised and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
At the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and election berliners from around the world : with them , residents from DDR times and former house occupiers are now sharing their jaws .
This is also noticeable in the rents , which have risen by nearly 60 percent in new rents since 2009 .
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on inserted slices or freshly removed facades , which have been thrown with colour bags .
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words `` left-autonomous violence . ''
One reason that not all neighbors view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen .
Most of the offences make up property damage , which tends to hit the new buildings and freshly refurbished houses .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
As far as acts of violence are concerned , it is appealing : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , who have certainly not been .
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer .
For the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : `` here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . ''
Neugebauer is deliberately pulled into Rigaer Street - and stayed .
That is why it was so important to her that the residents get their road back : from the police , the politics and the media , who all suddenly claimed the authority over the district in July .
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer , the road continues to be taken away from them : through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that crowd out the old residents .
`` These are , after all , property flats that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well beguiled , '' she says .
`` I absolutely can not endorse violence and destruction . ''
But what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
There is frustration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
For Zugezogens , who are annoyed by colour bombs , Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez .
Anyone who draws on should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district , can complain badly about noise there .
All the people only presented with first names have asked not to be named with their right name

B27 refurbishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
There is nothing to mock at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated .
For those responsible for the construction work , which starts at 5,30 o `` clock in the morning and only end at 20 p.m. , there is all the praise .
`` They have done everything quite zealously , '' says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station .
This is a superteam .
There is no delay either .
The construction site could be moved to the south at half-time at the halfway point , until the end of October everything is expected to be ready .
Praise will also be given to those responsible for the construction work , for example , when it comes to the setting up of containers .
Since the construction site has moved south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has also been restored , the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed .
The citizens can now return from Ofterdingen to the B 27 .
The traffic through the place seems to be going back .
`` There were some significant complaints , '' says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer , Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment .
The residents of Bachsatzstraße , Steinlachstraße , Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had struggled with more traffic noise because many cheques were searching and were more likely to trust their Navi than the signage .
What led to some trucks being franked in residential areas .
As the speed limits were not met , the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from Mössingen .
`` There have been significant excesses , '' says King , who made himself aware of the situation on the ground .
Two to three per minute have already been bleached .
The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres in the Tempo- 30 zone .
Since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become calmer .
For the businessmen at the B 27 , it is only a small consolation that , for customers from Rottenburg , the road is now open again .
In the cards , businessmen do not like to look .
But that the B 27 refurbishment at them has led to turnover breaks , leaving everyone to look through .
However , some are more and less affected .
Who has less to do with the `` end customer , '' that is to say for other companies , for which the refurbishment has little impact .
At the Maier car dealership , Thomas Sulz also speaks of a `` at most slight decline , '' but also admits that , of course , `` the running customer is missing . ''
The most battered are the locals along the road .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the Steakhouse , formerly crown , finds clear words .
This is already threatening .
Not only him , but all the restaurants have `` hit hard . ''
The customers were missing from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil .
We have to be happy about every euro turnover .
Sales losses are estimated at `` well over 50 percent . ''
Road rehabilitation has `` rebuffed '' its operation `` by two years . ''
He has had to sack half of his staff .
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been made redundant , the policy would have reacted differently .
Instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a question from Göhner as to whether there could be financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 .
Göhner knows of other counties where such a thing has been handled more generously .
In all complaints , Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
After all , the family business has been here since 1715 , it refers to the long history .
He can understand the fact that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management .
If you ca n't drive , it 's beautiful elsewhere too .
Göhner has no doubt that his tribal clientele will come back after the end of the rehabilitation work .
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza , Göhner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis its restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history .
Six months of construction work is already brutal .

For companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts are made to bypass ad blocking , a `` cat and mouse game . ''
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop side , Adblock Plus released a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the encoding with regard to its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the detection of which part of the page advertising is .
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes .
In a blogpost , Adblock Ben Williams ' spokesman wrote that `` this kind of Hin-and-Her-fight between the ad blocking open source community and the bypasses has already been under way since the invention of display blockers , '' and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's largest company has entered the fight for social media is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry .
Around the world , according to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe , about 200 million people use display blockers ; nearly four times as much in 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebooks .
The company has it on display blockers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook 's mobile app for the social network and Instagram , a spokesman said .
Advertising on Desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large proportion of revenue , so that Facebook appears to be rewarding the investment of such a step .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its `` ad preference '' tool to have people more control over advertising aimed at them .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that adblock new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising .
`` This is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , '' a spokesman for Facebook said in an email message .
Ad blockers are a stump means , which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people 's hands .

Olympia : triple fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya 's athletes are dropping Ungemach after the second doping affair at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and present-day coach , John Anzrah , had handed out an urine probe in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 -metre runner Ferguson Rotich .
This was reported to Kenya 's team management by the doping inspectors .
The IAAF World Federation has asked the IOC for information on the case to make its own inquiries , an IAAF spokesman said .
`` Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC , the IAAF will carry out an assessment , '' an IAAF statement said .
`` He ( Anzrah ) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich , the probe handed out and signed , '' declared Kenya 's chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi .
He was in possession of the athlete 's accreditation , which was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency 's training checks .
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
Four days earlier , Kenyan athletics leader Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games .
He is said to have informed sportsmen of his country about upcoming doping tests .
According to media reports , he should have been arrested on his return at Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time at the IOC after numerous doping offences .
In announcing the IOC 's more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio Games , it was unusually pointed out previously that athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system .
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympic start .
As a result , the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping is compliant with the rules of WADA .
Kenya is considered a major runner nation .
The country 's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
In a series of television reports from the ARD , accusations have repeatedly been made that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there is to be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had done in Russian athletics .
It has been proven that this sport has been covered in a comprehensive and systematic way .
Russia 's athletes were then excluded from the summer games .

NASA climate model : Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once habitable .
Scientists at NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus , with its hot , waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere , could once have shown erratic conditions .
Scientists have previously hinted that the slow revolt of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin , erratic atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
The model also lit up the topography of early Venus .
The planet probably dismissed more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation .
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
`` In the GISS model simulation , the slow revolt of Venus exposed its daily side of the sun for almost two months , '' said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release .
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun 's heat .
The result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of Earth today .
The model brought forth a history of Venus similar to the evolution that was previously believed by planetary researchers .
Although it was once presumably habitable , the Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
Their oceans darkened and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light .
As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today .
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters .

Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany 's Raser has to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested that are supposed to be particularly effective in transmitting tempos .
The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
For example , at highway construction sites or bridges with temporary templates , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary lightning for compliance with the speed limit .
However , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or elaborate .
The Enforcement Trailer is autark : its battery holds five days at uninterrupted measurement , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
With laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously .
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans after time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
In the high-powered state , you can move the trailer with every car with a trailer clutch , according to the manufacturer .
In order for him not to be simply cloned , he is lowered in the measuring operation , so the wheels in the armored and , incidentally , also shouted outside shell disappear .
In addition , a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism .
Since 2015 , the trailer has been tested and used in various federal states , according to Vitronic .
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technique : recently , France has reordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .

Cats react more sensitively than hangovers to cries of young animals
Biologists have examined in Hannover what effect the call of cat babies has on adult animals .
To her surprise , the males also did n't leave the males cold - however , unlike the females , they always behaved the same way .
Female cats can detect the excitement of cat babies at the minds of the little ones .
They respond by ten percent more quickly to sounds of kittens , which are in great distress , as scientists have found out from the veterinarian high school and the Medical University of Hannover ( MHH ) .
Hangovers are also responding to the calls of kittens - but always the same .
`` Apparently , the acoustic differences between the middling of less and heavily excited young animals for the males are either unperceptible or not important , '' said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH .
She is a director of the study published this Friday in the journal `` BMC Evolutionary Biology . ''
In a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens cries differ with the urgency of their need for help .
A total of nine adult hangovers and eight kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH .
They were pre-played on the one hand by little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings .
On the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens , which were additionally elevated .
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the low sample .
`` All females , even those who have not had their own offspring , reacted differently to the cries , '' said Konerding .
They turned more quickly to the loudspeaker when this call of the very more erroneous kittens played off .
This ability may be inherent or evolving with gender maturity .
`` A surprise was that the males reacted at all , '' the biologist said .
In the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises on several occasions .
Also , some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , whether they were mothers or not , the biologist Marina Scheumann reported .

Killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others : Khaled Omar .
He was the hero of Aleppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
He risked everything to save others .
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a face-bomb attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the `` white Helmets , '' a civil protection group that , according to the Bild newspaper , saved nearly 60,000 people so far .
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people out of crushed houses and to provide first aid in the war area .
They are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil protector showing him at a 11 -hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
It made the Syrian to the luminous symbol figure in the horror of war .
As heroes , however , he has never seen himself , according to the picture : `` for me , this is the real Jihad . ''
`` When I dare to save lives , I think that God sees a martyr in me . ''
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria .
The helicopters have thrown off four facial bombs above the Alzadia district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
A woman and two children died , and seven people are suffering from breathing .
`` We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that not children play with it , '' the picture quotes his last words before he died .
The Assad regime 's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists .

How to protect yourself with Krav Maga from gun attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you .
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi , a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance .
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the spy around for your robber .
If you are approaching you from behind , you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and `` get out of the firing line , '' says Mizrachi .
Then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbow .
Then beat him with the knee in the bar and turn , while the attacker crumbles from pain , the weapon from his hands , beat him with the run in the face and move backwards while turning the weapon on him .
In attackers approaching from scratch , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , take the weapon and turn it down so the attacker ca n't shoot .
Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attacker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and targeting the weapon on him .
Sounds difficult ?
Watch the video to see exactly how it prefers Mizrachi .
But remember that in a robbery , it is safest to pass your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster .

Culture of Political Correctness leaves electoral fraud flourishing in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report disclosed today .
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally attacking the police , election observers and town halls for having ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to `` oversensitivities concerning ethics and religion . ''
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti-corruption royal , said that intimidating voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lockout bands outside electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters .
He recommends that voters should have an identity card to prove their identity in elections .
At the moment , a voter only has to name his name and address .
The report proposes to put non-removable ink on a person 's finger when they cast their voting votes to prevent someone from choosing twice .
Whistleblowers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups .
`` This is not only against electoral fraud , but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it , '' he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London .
Last year , a special election court ruled that the acting mayor , Lutfur Rahman , should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
The court found that Rahman would have `` perverted '' the religious feelings of his Muslim community `` in a cynical way '' and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations .
Rahman is said to have `` led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . ''
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the consequence of an imitation where one person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent letter election - where older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including driving out expulsions to prove the identity
In his report , it says : `` As proof has been given that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds .
`` There were concerns that ... State institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior because of '' politically correct `` oversensitivities concerning ethics and religion . ''
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists from editing letters to stop `` electoral harvesting . ''
The report , considered by Theresa May , also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your card .
Non-removable ink on a person 's finger as soon as she has cast her vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
Carry out systematic reviews on a person 's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
A three -year limit on applications for an automatic letter choice .
Ban that political activists edit full letter elections and envelopes of letter elections .
Giving the police the power to set up lockouts around election stations .
A change in the law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 .
Photography ban in polling stations .
Requirement that only English be used in the polling stations ( except for Wales ) .
Intensifying the training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the electoral cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it `` astonishing '' that after the Tower Hamlets case , no criminal charges were made .
`` The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be inappropriate for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , '' he said .
He was found guilty of a number of reasons , according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
He also criticizes the ineffective `` hawkish controls '' of town halls `` electoral registration departments .
Sir Eric said : `` the court ruling in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning sign .
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .

Greenland hai : the oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks mostly come to the surface only in winter .
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the Sanna research vessel .
He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland sharks only get offspring at 150 years old .
The Greenland halfway through the North Atlantic Ocean , in a hour 's time , is an average of just 1,220 metres .
Only when it arrives , the five -metre long animal accelerates to sat 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this maximum speed .
This slow lifestyle , however , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal `` science '' at any rate from a Greenland hai that could be 392 years old .
`` Madness , '' commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan , which means a world record for vertebrae .
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are being stoned .
Just lacked the evidence .
Greenland sharks are hard to watch , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks .
Their tempo of time , when they took out six animals with a broadcaster in front of Spitsbergen .
Prey still make this sharks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice sea and looking for cadavers that torch down from higher water layers .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks , which picked up fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long , while the largest 502 centimetres measured .
To determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens of the sharks with the carbon 14 method .
This centre of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks , and the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed .
The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon 14 in the lens .
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 `` s , when nuclear weapons experimented with larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
On the other hand , in the 220 -centimetre length of the third smallest animal , the lens contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so it was likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its 2012 investigation .
All larger Greenland sharks , however , had normal carbon 14 quantities in their lens , resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
Indeed , the carbon 14 -clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenland hai showed an age of 335 , while the record shark with 502 centimetres is expected to be even 392 years old .
That Greenland hai females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres was known .
Now the researchers of the length have been able to assign an age .
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was 156 years old , Greenland sharks , with the proliferation , can obviously be used for at least one and a half centuries .
This , too , is likely to be world record for vertebrae .
The fact that such methane alems live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
Even the previous record holder , a 211-year-old Greenland whale in whose bacon at the neck was stuck a 120-year-old harbor tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
Due to low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on savings flame .
So they mature later - and ageing slower .
In addition , in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal loses heat .
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant .
Another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
`` A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , '' explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein .
A very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources in a long life .

Witnesses sought : beverage market covered in forest fires
A robbery was carried out on Thursday night on the beverage market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstraße .
Under the aegis of a firearm , three darkly dressed people who had muzzled their faces were asked by the employee of the beverage market to release cash and then first flew on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW golf .
How much money has been exploited does not divide the police .
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres in size , so relatively small .
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe-Market .
After the assault , the perpetrators must be in the direction of Gerberstraße , Friedrich-Engelbert-Way , and be flushed by the Scots car park with the silver-coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schladernring ) .
Anyone who has made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the attack ( at 19,45 p.m. ) is to report to the police as a matter of urgency .

`` A generation protests '' in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia encountered violent resistance from the government .
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police during shot changes .
Is Ethiopia just collapsing ?
Over the past decade , it has been one of Africa 's most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
But in recent months , protests against the government rocked the country and expanded into more and more areas .
Last week , thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
The government 's response was relentless , according to human rights organisations .
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed on tens of unarmed protesters .
Videos in circulation about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall .
The head of the U.N. Human Rights Authority is now demanding an in-depth investigation .
`` It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future , '' said Rashid Abdi , the Project Leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia , and only a few countries in Africa , if any , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia 's economy expanded at a considerable pace .
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa .
The streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
Even though Ethiopia was far from a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually cited oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissidents effectively silenced .
Many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wits of the desert .
But that could change .
`` If you suppress people and they have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , '' said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
The entire youth protest .
A generation protests .
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
After a largely criticized election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament .
At the same time , tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising ; a battle for this zealous , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden 's National Liberation Front , which have been more or less beaten in recent years , could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again .
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of precipitation under the surface .
The first seems harmless : smartphones .
Only in recent years have a very large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media , as cheaper smartphones became increasingly common and Internet services improved .
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying .
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since eons , the Amharas , who come from Ethopia 's predominantly Christian highlands , prospered in politics and economics , while exploiting the Oromos , many of whom are Muslims and living in lowland areas .
But that , too , is changing .
`` We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella , '' said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of the Oromos .
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population , and who are dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , in trade and politics .
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was Ethiopia 's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 .
He was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners .
Analysts say that he was particularly keen to perceive early signs of discontent and use special envoys to edit opponents and make them harmless .
`` The current regime lacks this fundamental skill , '' said Mr Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopia 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles .
Unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say he does n't enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray .
Many worry that the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005 , after thousands protested against elections , which , according to analytics , were seemingly catered for by the government and subsequently stolen .
During the subsequent raids , many protesters were killed , even if it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest went over relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty .
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government 's internal misgivings .
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month , protesters in Gondar , an amharic city , attacked by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media .
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position .
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for droning flights over neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed that base .
While the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
`` This , '' Mr Abdi said , `` is a very thin grate . ''

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
`` Anyone who does not suit and praises Erdogan sits on packed caffeine , '' says the chairman of the Gülen Foundation Dialogue and World , Ercan Karakoyun .
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects in the short term tens of thousands of protective seekers fleeing Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term , it could even become `` a few hundred thousand , '' the association 's chairman , Ali Toprak , believes .
Because of the hard push by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
`` In the short term , I reckon with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , '' says the Association chairman , Ali Toprak of the `` world '' of Friday .
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago , 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run .
After the thwarted coup , secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added .
Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
`` It is not acceptable for a state that itself is taking up refugees to produce refugees in their own country , '' said Toprak .
The chief of staff complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in alevitic cities .
In this way , Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
`` They are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced over the last hundred years , '' said Toprak , who is also a CDU member .
The chief executive called for the federal government to `` position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters . ''
A `` witch-hunt '' against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany .
I do n't feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition activists .
The fire mark as a Gülen supporter destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence .
`` Anyone who does not adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed caffeine , by the way , the Kemalists and seculars , '' said Ercan Karakoyun , Chairman of the Gülen Foundation Dialogue and Education , the `` world . ''
As the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks presented the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
On the date of 30 June , this was 11,386 people and , therefore , almost 29 % of all recognised as asylum seekers ( 39,625 ) .
This survey does not cover war , poverty or the lack of prospects .
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , that is to say , from the state side , individually persecuted .

GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanged its boss Matthias Hartmann .
The resignations suddenly came - but not entirely surprising .
The difficult situation of the market research firm GfK was that the chair of chief executive Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the successes he promised .
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK : after again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate governance , the global number five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
GfK board boss wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board , Arno Mahlert , is already leaving the supervisory board with effect from 12 September .
The leadership on the board is already taking over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger as of September 1 , the company announced .
He is expected to officially take over the function of a `` board spokesman '' until a successor to Hartmann is found .
As a reason for the resignations , the company called `` different views '' on the long-term business orientation .
Details did not want to name a company spokesman on Friday .
Anyone who will be the market research company in the future is still unclear at the moment .
In investor circles , it was said on Friday that the shareholder was most recently disappointed with the continued successes of the restructuring that took place years ago .
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011 .
`` The fruits of the restructuring have not yet been seen after 5 years , '' it said .
Given the last bad GfK business figures , any shareholder will eventually become troubled .
`` If this were the case with BMW , that would also make the quandaries so , '' it said .
The company had not been able to stop its loss journey in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the prior quarter .
With 361.2 million€ , sales were up 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior-year quarter .
Related to the first half of the year , sales shrank by 3.4 percent at 721.2 million€ .
The profit in the second quarter , in particular , has burdened the company 's sunken value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
The company 's depreciation of €139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Division , gave the Group a loss of €148.2 million .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GfK had still generated a group profit of 19.7 million .

Traveller Ian Wright is chasing his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveller underwent his immune system and dignitaries of a serious test - by ditching some of Europe 's dirtiest and most eclectic places .
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk shabbed his course on an euro note , a balloon at the Piccadilly Circus , a dishwasher of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system .
Before dragging each object , he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into .
But the experiment , filmed under the title `` the Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' brought some surprising results to light .
The idea of leaking the dishwasher of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely repulsive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchenette .
On his journey through Europe , Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
Thankfully , nothing he left behind left more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth .
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and enjoying peculiar and wonderful things .
From public money to train stations to washing buttons of toilets , the task definitely put his immune system under a probe
In the film he told : `` already as a child , I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film , he was in any case fair to his reputation .
The only thing he opposed was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
His trial discovery showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units .
In comparison , the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film `` the Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' which shows the bacteria number in different places like the bathroom
In the film , he says : `` this comes close to the worst I 've got in a toilet . ''
There is nothing dirtier than that !
I 'm not going to lure anything here because it 's indoors here .
`` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio .
The company is equipping Mr Wright with Valio freezing , which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Valio 's Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` we really wanted to offer something new to consumers .
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics .
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended that we said `` let us call Ian . ''
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hakala , who led the film 's directions , added : `` let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had put some of the things that I instructed him to lick , just like the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film . ''
Of course , there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult .
I 'm glad we 've included some of these dirty leaks on film. ``
In a 2015 survey carried out by Valio , 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the wellbeing of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria .

The charges per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of €2.10 ; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp €3.36 ( so far €2.26 ) and for Azendorf €3.64 ( so far €2.18 ) .
At the plant in Azendorf , the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are required .
After an excess calculation , the sewage price in Azendorf will be €4.37 per cubic meter .
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser ( CSU ) reported , during the approval of the budget by the Countess of Kulmbach , it was found that undercover for these sewage plants was underway .
As a result of legal bases , the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner .
From 1 October 2016 , the citizens , as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg , will have to go deeper into the purse .
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary .
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , it is also possible to compensate for over- or undercover discoveries from the previous calculation period .
The serious increase in fees justified Schmidt with the fact that all three wastewater facilities are relatively small , with a very low sewage , which is between 6800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year .
For example , due to the low distribution base , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand€ would have a serious impact .
In addition , the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
In addition , in the last calculation period , all three plants have been significantly reduced , not least because of their ageing and repair costs .
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Welschenkahl , Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf wastewater plant the mechanical ventilation plant had to be exchanged due to a damage .
In the Pumpwerk Welschenkahl , the nearly 20-year-old conveyor plants had to be overhauled from scratch and at the Lopp pond plant , after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be excavated , sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to continue to comply with the water requirements .
Schmidt : `` to these extraordinary expenses came the continuing care and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period . ''
The same applies to electricity costs , which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 .
Stone houses made it clear that , in the small waste water in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance are `` full . ''
At the same time , Schmidt added , the market community has been spared major entertainment costs in sewage plants over the past 20 years .
The situation for the aforementioned plants will , in the view of stone houses , continue to remain precarious in the long term , especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater will not be extended to include these facilities , because these are deficient facilities .

Snapchat `` Anime '' effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired , but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds .
With its filter tool , Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are blunt , stand-alone tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day .
All mistakes are made to the public .
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past , in which they were accused that the app would propel blackface or white skin as a beauty deal .
When , this week , some users suggested a filter that gave them slashes , false teeth and woven cheeks , some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - `` yellow face . ''
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
The news and outrage were widely shared on Wednesday , with reports from The Verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat announced it would have deactivated the feature .
The company offered an apology : the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters rather than as a caricature of Asians .
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of offending clichés .
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison .
In an email , Grace Sparapani , a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread , wrote that the filter was `` offensive and , to say the least , uncomfortable . ''
She added that `` it is difficult to argue with the counter-rendition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not yellow , but that the yellow face has been dragged into the devalued extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
And Snapchat 's big audience of young people - who are in terms of race different than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
If one of Snapchat 's filters creates an image that is offensive to an user , `` so it 's much harder that such things remain unnoticed than it used to be , '' said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium , decided to extinguish her Snapchat account urged others to do the same .
In an upset for medium and in a phone interview , she said that she believes racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the largely white , only male leadership and finished her upset with a hashtag : \ HASH DeleteSnapchat .
`` Either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , '' said the Chinese-American Zhu , `` or they have people with other skin colours who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what . ''
Others share their opinion , a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered .
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its staff , but according to a spokesman , the company recently recruited a staff member focused on under-represented populations and on internal integration efforts .
For her part , Zhu said that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added , `` I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K . ''

Rescue in Moelfre Bay : three men have `` luck still to be alive ''
Three men have `` luck still to be alive '' after being thrown from their fishing boat before Anglesey .
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13:20 BST alarm on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay .
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat was moving on their own .

Condoms with chilipuders , fireworks promote Tanzania 's elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going in man-made settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuders .
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation , which already had the idea to do so years ago , has stepped up its promotion , along with U.S. nature conservation , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four -step method to protect their homes and harvests without hurting animals .
Previously , many spears used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Telephone Day dedicated to animal welfare .
`` Since we developed this ... Toolkit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can hold the elephants off their fields without hurting the elephant , '' the CEO of Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a communication .
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blaze into a horn .
If he is not deterred , a so-called `` chili cloud '' is thrown .
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom , the end of which is turned up to the ignition .
When it is ignited , the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust to chilipuder into the air .
A hint quite usually already already out to jail the elephant .
One last possibility is an advertiser who shoots a golden fireworks in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
The state must respond positively and decisively to terrorist threats .
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split .
We will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
If criminals would have to leave the country more quickly , it would increase the security and strength of the population 's support for refugee policy .
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the 2017 federal election .
He also announced a further staffing of the security forces , `` on a medium four -digit scale over several years . ''
Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
Video surveillance is to be improved , the gun law is so novel that , above all , the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult .
The most recently discussed confidentiality for doctors is to be preserved according to de Maizière 's words .
However , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to seek solutions to how to reduce the vulnerability of citizens , he said , with a view to mental health .
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees , the Minister considers that better social care is needed .
Teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people .
To prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Darknet ) , de Maizière plans to use concealed investigators .
SPD leader Gabriel said : `` the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . ''
It is important that the Minister for the Interior has made a clear opposition to action .
`` This was an earnest for the sharemarkets in the CDU / CSU , '' Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group ( Friday ) .
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a Burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
He considers a general ban on full concealment to be constitutionally problematic .
You can not ban everything that you reject , and I reject the wearing of the burqa .
It is possible to talk about rules , for example , in the field of road transport or for witnesses in the courts .
Greens leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate power and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages .
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said : `` fleet spray and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people of this country . ''

Buyer in Primark outraged over woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of business
The buyers did n't know where they should look when a woman pulled out her clothing amid a primark to try underpants .
To make the situation worse , she mustered how she looked in it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf .
She continued to stoke and tried four pairs of underhoses in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone , Feb .
The Primark business at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone , where the woman tried the underhoods before putting her back in the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , `` she attracted herself again and left the business without buying anything . ''
She said : `` people could n't believe what they saw . ''
Standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of underpants from the outlay , pulled out her own tights and pants and tried her .
`` She did n't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , freaking out like Oskar . ''
`` Everyone starred when they pulled out the underhoods , who obviously did n't like it , as they put them back into the shelf . ''
She repeated the same with three other underhoods before finally deciding that you liked nothing , got back and ran out .
`` She did n't seem to disrupt it that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underhoods she had tried . ''
Ms Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : `` how disgusting to think that someone would take underhoods with home that had a different person and who were not washed . ''
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added : `` As I got along , the staff tried to pull the garments out of the sale after it went - which is just as good . '
`` I 'd hate to go home with a new pair of underhoods and find out that another woman had her and pulled out again and they were n't washed up . ''
A spokesman for Primark said : `` Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday 9 August . ''
All the products in question were pulled out of the sale .

Salzburger `` West Side Story '' with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the `` West Side Story '' with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Julia .
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
A musical conquers Salzburg : the `` West Side Story , '' Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece .
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of the classics and met with the role of Maria a youth space .
In the orchestral ditch the Simón Bolívar Orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel : `` this music is full of rhythm , '' he warmed .
We always say that it is very Latin American .
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
It 's a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein 's music in our blood !
In this staging , Bartoli plays an older sought-after Maria .
She remembers waking up to her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
The role of Maria has always fascinated me .
First , because it is musically extraordinary !
And then there would be Maria 's personality .
She says it in her song : `` I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and witty and bright . ''
So she 's smart , of course , also naive , and very passionate .
`` She resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , '' laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It 's such a honour for us to work with her .
She is an immensely generous person .
And Bartoli returns the compliment : `` Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! ''
Conducting is a necessity for him .
You see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it 's his life !
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
We both have a more southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
For American director Philip Wm McKinley , the `` West Side Story '' is highly topical : `` this piece is about prejudice and fanaticism . ''
Today , we have the refugees , at that time the Puertorians went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
They are the same issues , and they are just as meaningful today as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Scots Callum Skinner storms home when Briton erects gold for cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men 's team-sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow countryman , Sir Chris Hoy , had embraced , making the legend proud when he stumbled home to win a victory from New Zealand 's favourites .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympics medals .
They repeated the trick after they picked up only a modest sixth place in March at the rail world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver , Jamie Staff .
They did so in time as Hindes appeared .
Hoy 's retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man they stayed at when they saw potential in the Scot , which has now unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny - who sided with Hoy four years ago - and skinners set an Olympics record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Zealanders won in the first round .
And the British trio won the duel with gold .
Hindes was barely back after his round , but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it .
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation , at which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace .
Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped skinner , Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the podium .
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said : `` it 's a flattering comparison . ''
I 'm just here to do my best and make me a name .
We set up an Olympic record in the end and defeated the world champions .
It was just unbelievable .
There is no better way to win this .
After the 2012 triumph at the Kenny and Hoys side , Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the railways after a weak start .
He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England 's rivals .
With such a surprising victory , this time there was no such problem .
Hindes said : `` it feels with all the GB flags in the gallery like London . ''
We 've come together as a team in the last three months .
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
This is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months , that expects us to be successful five days in the Velodrom .
With the form Kenny , it is in the area of the possible that he repeats Hoy 's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , who was also born on 23 March ( an apparently sacred date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the same as that of Hoy .
Kenny takes part next in the sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said : `` I 'm just enjoying this for the moment . ''
The team event is always best .
You can win it with his colleagues .
It feels somewhat lonely to win alone .
Hindes said : `` if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the knighthood . ''
It was the day 's only medal contest , but there was further good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four -four -kilometre race .
They arrived at the goal in 3:51.942 .
The world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3:51.659 .
The first and final round ( 22,42 ) will take place today on the second day of the contest , where Wiggins will certainly be in focus .
He had stepped in yesterday with Officers before qualifying when officials called for him to measure his body size .
In the appropriate women 's competition , which will continue and end tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4:13.260 .
The GB team is relying on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a shar of medals .
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were downgraded .
It played off dramas in the background , according to the resignation of technical head Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and mobbing allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
However , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom , it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GBs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .

Once squeezed over the price from the market , café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shameful café in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi-Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
Of course , prices were squeezed out of his Bedford Avenue shop front .
The Soap Cherie business , which replaced verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cupcakes .
Locals charged it as the last loss in a gentrifying city .
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , `` I know New York is change , but I still ca n't believe that CBGB is dead , the Chelsea hotel gutted and verb is now a soap business . ''
But if New York is change , it is also reinvention .
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint , less than a mile north of its original location .
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
The coffee is still good .
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a long-time employee of the old cafe , who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outpost , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , maintained a lot of things .
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment as well .
He introduced new ingredients .
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garments like capers and sucked onions .
There are natural treasures .
The café no longer serves beer , there are fresh juices for it .
After nine months , Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
`` Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg , '' he said .
Recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint , she would take the path on her own .
After the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
`` It became clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that liked me , '' she said .
Now she is drinking coffee again , even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003 .
He went there before work and invariably always ordered Dassel .
`` I came after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter , '' he said .
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu .
Today , Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he had n't been hungry about the soap business taking the old business space .
In fact , the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cafe 's cold-blown coffee as an ingredient .
`` I think we 're still going to go on their offer , '' Rodriguez said .
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café .
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he prefers to exhibit them soon , so his new neighbours feel welcome .
The location also has other benefits .
A local juice locale would like to fill and sell the cold-blowed coffee into the bottle .
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building .
For many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favourites .
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
When the new cafe opened , Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a home return .

Volkswagen is still glimpsed .
Despite diesel scandals , extradition figures worldwide are rising .
But not all markets are running around .
In the case of recall , there is a term for a term .
Volkswagen is staring at the deliveries more forcefully into the second half of the year .
In the past year , despite the diesel affair , Europe 's largest automobile can continue to show a plus , thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets .
But in July , the core brand , VW , weakened mainly in Western Europe , and thus again burdened the total sales , as the company listed in the Dax said .
Worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July than in the previous month .
In Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were up 14 percent below the previous month .
In Germany 's home market , deliveries sacked by almost a sixth .
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
Moreover , in some core markets , there has been a retention of purchase by `` changing economic conditions . ''
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the UK vote to leave the EU also strained , a spokeswoman explained .
In the US , where the exhaust affair first escalated , there is also a minus to beech .
Big support for VW is the Chinese market .
In total , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is still glimpsed by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only an extradition minus of 0.9 % to 3.37 million vehicles is to be found .
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales luck from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software .
In Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million cars to convert to the workshops .
In the course of the conversion , VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact .
After the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
After retrofitting , the automobile exhibits a `` guarantee '' certificate , but it does not talk about a `` guarantee , '' as it said on Friday in business circles .
The reason is legal .
The `` Focus '' had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models .
This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
From the Department of Transportation , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
`` VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA . ''
`` Deviations from this are not accepted , '' said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , according to the ministry .
VW has taken on the guarantee that , in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power , no deterioration will occur after the conversion , and that all typical vehicle values will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term `` guarantee '' but not as it was called in corporate circles .
In the broad term `` guarantee , '' Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers , for example , to get into a workshop half a year after retrofitting , for example , and to return this to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
Even in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid the fact that , in the event of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal , it will be insecure in terms of possible warranty arrangements , as it was called .
That is why VW does not use the term `` guarantee . ''

Future of Portland 's meltdown due to lifting of energy
The future of Portland 's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers `` jobs - are at stake , as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract , thereby lifting all supply contracts , as the delivering energy company announced .
This move followed the government 's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the plant .
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November .
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa 's plant in Portland are at stake .
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
In addition , it could come to domino effects , as the meltdown consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias consumed .
In 2014 , Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei , which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alcoa 's meltdown in Portland is losing money and risking a closure .
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and , most recently , due to the electricity price for the plant .
AGL , which supplies the large aluminum meltdown with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley , announced that it expects three other owners to cancel their contracts .
The plant is in the majority possession of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina , of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares .
`` AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity through the meltdown , '' the company said .
AGL also said the contracts were so-called `` back-up deals '' that should have come into effect from November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017 .
`` Therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the 17 financial year , '' the electricity supplier said .
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its $ 187 million annual report in `` expectation of a termination . ''
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts , the `` ability of Alcoas ... To operate the meltdown or to ensure the power supply to the meltdown '' does not impair .
The U.S. company said it had completed a 20 -year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still guilty of a statement as to why it resigned from the contract .
Analysts warn of the industry 's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle .
In reference to the analysts `` statements earlier this week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumed around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year .
Should both plants disappear from the market , that would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [ electricity market ] .
And for us as electricity producers , that would not be good , `` he said .

For 31 years exemplary for clarity
The managing director of the `` Veitenstein Group , '' Ruppert Göller , is retiring .
The association is considered to be `` bay-wide exemplary . ''
A small flimsy drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
For example , some time ago in the original , it was in a contribution from the Bayerische Rundfunk .
Little later , the water forum of the government of Unterfranken paid tribute to the purpose association .
The work of the Veitenstein group is `` bayernwide as exemplary . ''
Behind all this is Rupert Göller , who was 31 years in the purpose association , of which 28 years as CEO .
Now , at the age of 65 , he was retired .
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein group , based in Kottendorf , municipality of Breitbrunn , promotes about 150,000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants .
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter , Breitbrunn , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach .
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
The current chairman , Breitbrunn 's Mayor Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert Göller was recruited as a watershed in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director in 1988 .
`` Its tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work to office and organisational activities , budgeting , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends , '' the chairperson said .
As outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurbishment of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re-creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipelines .
There has been no stalemate and there have been repeated innovations , because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
In her Laudatio , she praised Göller 's loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
He has worked with a lot of heartthrob for his Water Confederation and he has lived up to the Water Confederation as if it were his own company .
A few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was able to present the concept of success of the Veitenstein group to the nitrate cut in front of the Water Forum of the District of Unterfranken .
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this .
Rupert Göller , for his part , praised water wart Alfons Griebel , who worked with him for 28 years .
He is the best watershed and he was a loyal crunch .
Together we were an unbeatable team .
As highlights from his point of view , he described the Brunnenbau and the reorganisation of the purpose association .
The biggest challenge and the most difficult bet , however , were the pipe breaking at the high container at Kirchlauter on a 3 January .
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the localities could be supplied with water .
It was also possible to maintain the supply of Neubrunn only because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses .
The management of the drinking water association has been handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter , who follows the succession of Rupert Göller .

The £2 -per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time .
The germinating drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
The NHS 's regulator NICE has recommended a four -year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
The NHS 's regulator NICE has recommended a four -year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke .
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that make up coverings .
When the Belag breaks apart , it can cause a blood clot that closes blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
If the blood clot solves , it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
Ticagrelor , which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely .
NICE 's draft bill , published today , recommends a 12-month intake of 90 mg of Ticagrelor , followed by 60 mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said : `` despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . ''
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
Experience shows that in combination with aspirin , Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
Through a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .

Rio 2016 : ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes an internethit
Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics .
This shows the brave appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
At the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that at times he was no longer seen in the TV images .
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
In the social networks , he subsequently became the viral internethit .
In fact , the 24-year-old finished his forehand with a backlog of 48 seconds and ranked 59th place of 59 starters .
It was , however , his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
Why the 24-year-old nevertheless takes part in the Olympics ?
The Ethiopian got a special start from the international swimming association .
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more familiar .
As most athletes run in Ethopia , they just wanted to do something different .
Preparation is all : ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race .
Quickly , the first nicknames made the round .
Some media described him as `` ROBEL of the Wal . ''
The English tabloid `` the Sun '' with `` dad Bod '' made it funny .
His time , he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 metre freestyle , played no role there .
Comparisons with `` Eric the Eel '' were also drawn .
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney , the run of Eric Moussambani provided media attention .
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to go on his own in a forehand over 100 metres of free style .
Frenetically , Moussambani was fired at the time .
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - multiple deaths
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , the State Department spokesman , Thomas Schnöll , said Friday morning .
She had suffered cut wounds and had been treated in hospital but has already been able to leave this one again .
Her home trip was scheduled for early September .
Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket , as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon , also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard , according to Schnöll .
In the roughly 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hua Hin was first seen exploding two bombs on Thursday night in a nightmare .
According to police , a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrians , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning , two explosives went up again , and another man was killed , according to the authorities .
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning .
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach resort of Patong , which was popular with holidaymakers .
In Surat Thani on the country 's south-east coast , another bomb then exploded that killed an urban employee .
The explosive rate has gone into the air , according to authorities in a flower beet in front of the coastal police force .
Finally , detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast , as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast , called for several injured .
One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin , it said .
`` The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting , '' said Armeegeneral Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists .
`` We assume that this is a coordinated attack . ''
It is too early to comment on possible motives , but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country in the attacks .
The Thai police , on the other hand , said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or to international terrorism .
`` This is only local sabotage , which is limited to limited areas and provinces , '' a spokesman in Bangkok said .
Rather , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta .
In the past few days , the authorities have received intelligence indications of impending attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact date and the places .
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
Police dismissed their officials across the country to step up security around important government buildings , as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amusement districts .
In Thailand , there are always smaller bombings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
In Hua Hin lies a palace used for years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
After the bomb explosions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities should follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
High security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings .
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations , it is not necessary to travel to these provinces .
Increased security risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta .
This gives the military a great deal of influence over the coming years .
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to stir chaos while the country moved towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
The military unta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , is holding itself up to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
However , the military has not managed to get to grips with the uprising of Muslim rebels that has been simmering in the country 's extreme south for years .
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
Just over a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists .
It was the bloodiest attack of the country 's younger history .

Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday , leading to too little co-determination in the team 's decision-making process .
Alternative President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately search for a new coach .
`` Over the last three years , I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , '' said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion .
I 've been thinking long and much over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , this needed it and bring it to a higher level .
To achieve this , the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the team 's performance .
These conditions are not being met at the moment .
Sakic , who had recruited Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked him for his contributions to the team .
`` Patrick informed me of this decision today , '' said Sakic .
We all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was honored during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013 - 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the league 's best coach .
He led the club to 112 points and in first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota 's playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years .
The Avalanches recorded a 39 - 39 - 4 mark in the 2015 - 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points .
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .

Military leadership distorts ISIS intelligence information , notes congressional committee
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground , a congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday .
The provisional report , created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee , Secret Service Commitees and the WehrBudget Command , reports of major discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how prescriptions changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against Islamic State .
The Central Command , short Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` Intelligence information , typically sent off by high-level Centcom commanders , regularly featured a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground , and were consistently more positive than analysis of other intelligence services , '' a newspaper article quoted the report as saying .
`` What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , '' said Ken Calvert , Republican member of the House of Representatives .
The leadership flaws in the Centcom range to the top of the organization .
The ten -page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
Although it does not provide direct indications that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` During the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than the facts , '' the report noted .
For example , a Centcom associate publicly announced that a military recapture of Mossuls could start as early as April or May 2015 .
Mossul , Iraq 's second largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
`` After months of investigation , it is so much clear , '' said Mike Pompeo , Republican Congressman from Kansas , in an opinion .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command 's peaks changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq .
Republicans called the task force into life after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on Islamic State .
The report , published on Thursday , will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
In addition , further investigation by the Centcom reports is under way by the Department of Defense 's inspector general .
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday , coinciding with some of the Republican task force 's conclusions .
`` In 2014 and 2015 , the Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services , '' the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committees , member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff , announced in an opinion .
This process , according to Mr. Schiff , `` delayed the publication of intelligence reports , '' damaged the morality among analysts and `` gave excessively little room for divergent opinions . ''
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said not to have found any evidence of a White House intervention at the Centcom analysts about a `` certain political opinion . ''
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by `` the Daily Beast . ''
Last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon 's inspector general , which were recorded following complaints from Centcom analysts .
Lt. Cmdr . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon press secretary , admitted in an opinion that the Department of Defense would not comment on any reports from Congress , while the inspector general 's investigation was still under way .
But he also admitted that `` experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . ''
The investigation has repercussions beyond the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of defense ministry members ) .
Last year 's accusations , however , raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
Criticizing the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of constraints from more than ten years ago , when a Centcom analyst , Gregory Hooker , drafted a document on how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , foresaw only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
Last year , the team around Mr. Hooker , according to government offices , notes that , contrary to the government 's statements , airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group 's financial position , as these provisional refineries would have been commissioned to sell oil on the black market .
However , this finding was not published , the Times reported in September .
Centcoms then commander , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .

Better traffic flow on the motorway carrier
It regularly stops on the bypass - here 's a picture of November .
But this is to change : the legal blaze is to be extended .
This is good news for all car drivers who are in congestion on the ambient road every night when they drive through the highway ( A 43 ) .
The provincial road construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße 700 meters .
Motorists can then turn right from the Hammer Strasse to the right .
The big advantage : the traffic divides more early , improving the overall flow on the much-vaunted section of the Bundesstraße 51 .
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West .
The carriageway on the carrier nerves the motorists mainly between 17 a.m. and 19 pm .
Working days stretch back to the bridge over the Albersloher route and sometimes beyond .
The reason is the Nadelöhr on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße .
From here , traffic is only steadily channelled through the highway bridge .
The second track had to be rebuilt just over a quarter of a century ago .
The reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary power to include , above all , heavy goods traffic .
For how long this bottleneck and the associated work-day congestion will continue , the competent national operation can not say .
However , there are years to come : the bridge has an official residual duration up to the year 2034 .
For the extension of the legal abbey , the national operation has deliberately chosen the weaker time in the school holidays because it is expected to be disabled .
Traffic will be spurred on the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .

Reid says that Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democrats `` presidential candidate , Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court .
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland 's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March .
The majority leader in Sen. Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the late judge 's successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia .
Reid said on Thursday during a phone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland `` with some degree of certainty . ''
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated .
He praised Garland and said Clinton 's team would not care for unrest with a new candidate .
Garland is the supreme judge for the U.S. Appellation Court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination , being Lakaien and helper workers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
He also noted that Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency .

Relaxing night : tips against sleep disturbances
In the evening you can walk around forever , at night you will be awake for hours , and in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the wake-up .
This is far from recovering .
After all , such problems are in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is often or permanently unrecoverable .
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances speak ?
There are several forms of sleep disorder , and it can be based on a variety of causes , emphasizing Hans-Günter Week , the board member of the German Society for sleep research and sleep medicine .
What one understands , however , is the Insomnie , that is , a disorder and a sleeping disorder .
In particular , many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagenknecht , member of the Board of Directors of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony .
What is behind sleep disturbances ?
The causes of sleep disturbances are complex .
Behind it can be organic , mental or behavioral factors , but also medicines .
Often the sleep disorder is an expression of another illness .
`` Very early waking up is often the case with depression , '' says Week .
And it may be that different factors are mutually dependent .
For example , anyone who has a disc incident may be bad , wakes up every two to three hours and may start to greet about everyday problems and worries , Week gives an example .
This leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
When should I have sleep disturbances to the doctor ?
Anyone who does n't sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor , Week advises .
The impairment can look very different : one is beaten , tired , undisclosed , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily riddled , has mood fluctuations or physical ailments such as stomach or headache .
To alleviate sleep disorder , it is important to find out the causes .
As treatment options come , among other things , behavioral changes , cognitive behavioral therapy , or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Established sleeping medical practitioners rarely exist in Germany , insists Prof. Ingo Fietze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin .
Therefore , if you have sleep problems , you should first contact the doctor .
This can be used to investigate whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should go to the sleeping lab , and what happens ?
For the study in the sleeping laboratory , for example , medical practitioners advise on snoring with breathing suspenders , in sick day fatigue , in sleeping converters or if you do n't find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fietze explains .
It is not really necessary to prepare for the investigation .
You should spend the day normally .
`` Just do n't make a lunchtime sleep , '' says Fietze .
After the cabling , you go to bed at its normal time .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , one wears a nasal glasses , a chest belt and a feather at the finger .
In addition , a camera on the ceiling features the sleeper .
How can people get to grips with the problems ?
There are quite a lot of pitch screws that can be used for better sleep .
Week counts on : regular sleeping and upcoming times , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , not watching TV to sleep , avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately , and that is not conducive at all .

England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London , but across the country .
For me , this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows , just as then in 2012 in London , when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End .
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow .
For our local communities , we alone will create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage .
The doubters had 2012 wrongs and they will also be wrong at Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcoming , but Heathrow answers every question put to him .
Like the Olympics , Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £211 billion in wide-ranging growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the whole of GB .
We have a great team at Heathrow , which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row to the world 's best airport terminal , up to the T2 , which was built amid the world 's two most frequented runways .
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway , which is supported by £16 billion in private investment .
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow 's expansion will also be one .
It is time we steered this Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow , securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .
Lord Paul Dwarton is chairman of the Heathrow Boards and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury

Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by her from the Hepatits C legal battle with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc .
In June , Gilead was freed from a $ 200 million damages payment for breaching two patents of Merck , which were in connection with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead , after an U.S. judge revealed a pattern of misconduct by Mercks , including the opinion of opinion and other unethical acts .
In charging the lawsuit on Thursday , U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to decree the costs incurred while defending the case .
Merck is trying to equalise with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
The case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property on laboratory work , which Sofosbuvir was based on , the active ingredient in Gilead 's medications .

Fierce rains , flooding gives cause for rescue in Louisiana , Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the state of emergency on Friday .
Numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall , the National Weather Service reported .
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already on the way .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the governor 's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , announced that requests for flood vehicles , boats and sandbags were increasing .
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone would have requested ten thousand sandbags .
A flood warning system is being deployed across much of the south of Louisiana until Saturday .
The weather service indicated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
In southern Alabama , a flood-early warning system was deployed on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs , both of which are located in Louisiana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
The metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge .
He also said that a strom-downward flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger , as these will only flow slowly in the Lake Maurepas across the rivers .
The River Tickfaw , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , already reached 09,00 the highest level ever recorded on Friday .
Rescue teams still poured people out of the floodwater in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday .
Hansford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose sharply overnight .
He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him .
`` We woke up and the water flowed and flowed , '' Hansford said .
It reached my waist .
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there , she would never have seen such a high of the river .
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a major military truck and had brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster , where they were housed until Friday .
Krautmann said the flood had `` spread rapidly '' as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions .
According to Krautmann , an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain .
Krautmann said the ground had been significantly softened by the rains since Wednesday .
Authorities said heavy rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching failure in five school districts .
The CBS subsidiary , WWL , reported that an associate in Tangipahoa gave 200 flooded houses .
Residents were evacuated in two churches , which have now both been flooded .
The premiere of the community of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets , which were battered by the flooding .
In the cities of Amite and Hammond , temporary shelters were set up to house the evacuees .
`` Once the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , '' he said .
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa , nearly two dozen roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags provided for residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops .
`` The last major flood we had was in March , '' said Lacy Landrum of the city administration .
This seems to be a similar incident .
In Mississipp , the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it continued to rage on the Gulf Coast .
According to his data , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported as flooding on Thursday , but none were reported on Friday .
Keith Townson , manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
`` I 've seen water in places where I 've never seen it before , '' said Townson , `` and it 's still coming . ''

Pokémon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that 's worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
That teenagers and child no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens , has been lamented by many in the last decade .
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and making it more active .
The time on the screen was initially on the TV , then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones .
So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I am referring , of course , to the Pokémon Go-Wahn , an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990 s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest sank ahead of the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded .
Within a few days , Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons , which are traced with a GPS and , once they have been found , can be `` photographed '' ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or `` captured . ''
A generation that played the game when she was even younger , joined the whip and jumped for the search from the sofa .
In the US , the game led to a significant increase in steps that the `` average '' person puts back every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game 's launch , the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
Many public health campaigns to get people to `` take themselves 30 minutes '' to `` come from the sofa '' and `` be active every day '' encountered deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look elusive .
Nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be overvalued .
Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
Physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
But the miraculous thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
Thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people even close new friendships on the hunt .
As always , there are also mysterious gamblers who always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could run against a door .
What is to be done ?
A breakthrough has occurred .
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier in the day , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game .
The new will lose its charm and the use will decrease over time .
However , due to Pokemon 's success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Queensferry Crossing : bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the North deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife .
It is the first of four closures of the `` cover blowers '' that are approaching the completion around each of the bridge 's three towers .
Fife 's bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 swirling ropes .
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Business Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
He said : `` this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings .
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the pitch .
In total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck is getting a bedtime for the deck in Rosyth today , meaning the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : `` the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
In this fantastic project , the closure represents forward-looking high and low construction .
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower deck in the expansion , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side .
This was achieved by dragging the northern train bridge 700 millimetres south .
This was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate activity .
Massive , as the viaduct is 222 meters long , weighed about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an increase of about 3 % .
Delicate , as the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres .
Thankfully , everything went very well .

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main , therefore , has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
`` It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote , '' says Michael Voigtländer , head of the IW 's financial markets and real estate markets .
After the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
As far as the so-called EU passport is concerned , they have so far been admitted to the UK .
This is just using big U.S. banks .
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs .
The `` Frankfurt Main Finance '' lobby group expects 10,000 new jobs to be created within five years .
For Frankfurt , the IW says , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the eurozone 's largest banks , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority , EIOPA and the ESRB risk council .
In Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
`` Proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate so directly with the oversight , '' says IMF Professor Voigtländer .
Although Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it is doing worse than Dublin in terms of infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
The city also has easy access to commercial real estate .
`` In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices , '' says Voigtländer .
At the Seine , rents for first-class commercial real estate are also 50 % higher than on the Main .
In addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
In a ranking of the company 's consultancy Mercer , the city is ranked 19 th , Luxembourg ranked 33 th , Dublin in 37th place and Paris in th place .
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference : `` with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , '' the IW concluded .
London , however , will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Brexit vote , the economic researchers say .
For this , the balance of power also speaks : in London , according to figures from Landesbank Helaba , around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 62500 .

Donald Trump election campaign indicted after staff allegedly pulled weapon
New York : Donald Trump 's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after it was announced that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a firearm on an employee in February while travelling in a jeep in February .
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte 's National Court by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
Bordini admitted to having waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realised that `` this would not happen . ''
The campaign manager , Earl Philip , `` drew a gun , put his right pointer on the deduction , and rammed the run in Vincents Kneekehle , '' Bordini admitted in his charge .
After complaining at the local and regional campaign management , Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip , he admitted in the indictment .
`` Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage , '' Bordini said .
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the `` second Amendment people '' - firearms owners and gun enthusiasts - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed judges .
Trump 's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of context and that he would not incite violence .
Bordinis ' complaint requires damages from the campaign for the breach of due diligence and from Philip for injury and lasting mental damage .
Trump 's press secretary , Hope Hicks , was not to be reached for an opinion .
Attempts to contact Philip also failed .
WCCB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign .
On calls at his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , was not reacted .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign so far .
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc. , 16 -CS- 14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly : `` It 's getting better '
Like most 6 -year-olds , Edmund Picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
But like the least of his contemporaries , Edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy .
When he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I 'm not creating that .
I 'm not creating that .
I did not admit that .
What is not true at all -- of course , it has been adhered to , `` she said .
Her husband Vincent and her has been told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it .
`` My first answer to that was '' I did n't know that people still do , `` '' explained Picciuto .
Edmund can run with the help of a remedy .
Edmund could not sit or crash until his third year of life and he still ca n't speak .
But he is making slow progress .
He can run with support and bike ride .
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund thought for `` please sing me something before . ''
`` We bring it to him , '' Picciuto told CBS News .
But it 's not a typical character language -- she says , Edmund has invented some characters alone .
Microcephaly has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Edmund , as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy .
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus .
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
What will happen ?
And she still does n't really know .
I have n't asked for the prediction for a long time , because I do n't expect them to be able to tell me anybody really .
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus .
It 's getting better .
You know it 's going to get better for you .
You 'll love your child and your child will love you .

Legislation is constantly being screened in the name of the fight against terrorism .
Following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package .
But what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the concierge .
All his proposals are `` politically reasonable '' for the coalition partner , says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package .
They do n't overcharge anyone .
Other , more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
As Minister of the Interior , however , he is in a position to achieve results and to achieve a `` achievable consensus '' within the coalition .
De Maizière has missed a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
However , these are now all the more extensive .
Some things are already known , proclaimed , pronounced : that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new .
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law .
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is equally unsurprising .
In part , de Maizière is launching a second start for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment , and to crack down on jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport .
`` This will be difficult points for the SPD , '' the CDU man admits .
He still thinks this is reasonable and does not call for any chances in the coalition partner anyway .
A few new ideas presents de Maizière as well .
They have it in part : it plans fast-track procedures for deportation and more opportunities to detain people before deportation .
Refugees who are targeted in the country are expected to chase their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review .
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to put some even worse than hitherto - for example , those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity .
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive .
Some of them are still unbalanced and leave questions open .
And , on a number of points - with regard to the inequality of patience , for example , - the question arises : what does this really have to do with security and terror ?
Yes , de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
But it can not be denied that the offenders of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees .
Moreover , many people worried about security , given the high numbers of refugees .
And things that people were deeply concerned about could not be excluded even in campaign times .
Internal security has been tremendously focused .
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
The uncertainty is great .
And yes , there are election campaigns .
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
Over the past few days , it has been high between the two parties .
First a garnish dispute over the equipment of the federal police , then about a security policy gathering of some Union interior ministers , in which the Ressortchefs also call for a Burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship .
De Maizière is also looking for conciliatory sounds .
He does not think of a departure from the double pass .
We have befriended the discussion in Germany .
It does not make sense to reopen it .
And in a Burka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually `` reasonable '' for the coalition partner , it has yet to be shown .
There is something in it that could cause dispute .
But the SPD is also trying to prop up the issue of internal security .
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first signals caution and says : `` the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . ''

Simone Biles creates gold in the doorway
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all this .
Dynamic on the jump horse .
Effortlessly on the bar .
Breathtaking on the floor .
On whole line brilliant .
And now , finally , Olympic champion .
The 19-year-old American Turnerin erupted to the multi-campaign title on Thursday , widening the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the headlight of the Olympics .
Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and `` final Five '' team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina .
The American Simone Biles is touring on the weaving beam during the women 's single multicampaign in the art turf at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth , while solidifying her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated her sport the last three years , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lou 's Olympic champion said of her that she is `` the best turner I 've ever seen . ''
It was expecting a last test in Brazil , a contest that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations .
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be seen as a disappointment .
The American Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace themselves after they each won gold and silver in the women 's singles multi-campaign inch in the art turf at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell celebration of team coordinator Martha Karolyi .
Although Biles insisted that during her long journey to the top , never planned the future , that 's not really true .
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tumbling passport - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
This is not a coincidence .
This girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman 's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained , became a force .
She has n't lost a multi-campaign contest since the summer of 2013 , a victory series that will last for as long as it wants Biles .
Even though Mustafina led easily by two rotations , the image declined .
Weaving beams and ground turkeys - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurked .
She picked up again with 15.433 on the wearing beam - and set one on it with a 15.933 on the floor .
Raisman gently embraced her as they were expecting her final glue - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles gleefully red , white and blue Eyeliner when the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
Raismans `` performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggled around third place , but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina .
This time , the 22-year-old team captain , called `` grandma '' by the Americans , had a lead .
After her ground exercise , she accused the audience of cushions , overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful .
As for Biles , the 19 -year-old 's rapidly spreading tweet has a whole new meaning from earlier this week :

Amid the Rage of the Olympics , the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are , however late it is , it is the Olympics .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inescapable , a rushing squeeze between competition and quest .
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stove , which is passed from the bracelet to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete .
You ca n't turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour 's conversation in the queue at the Coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there 's Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who is here for the first time at the Olympics and a women 's swarm with greens , could well have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer , turner or even a fan .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting gold in the Olympic trampoline turf .
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same .
Further from the centre , partly in the shadows are the sports that are not universally recognised : air gun shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
We will always have the breast swim and may it prevail for a long time .
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
Although the trampoline rush has already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was perceived so sparingly the last 16 years that many the , I had interviewed , did not know it was an Olympic sport at all .
This could also be regional ignorance .
Although the U.S. sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in the trampoline rush and has had an athlete by 2012 who has managed it to the end .
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline rush has a certain outsider charm , in part because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clownish school than that for the Olympics .
At this point , I should admit that I am not an expert but just an earnest enthusiast .
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of the turf and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it .
The word `` trampoline '' comes from the Spanish El Trampolin , which means as much as `` springboard . ''
Rising sieges jump on a gigantic trampoline , shooting almost up to 30 feet into the air and having to take a series of falling movements ( turning , hitting and saltos ) before landing on their feet .
They are assessed according to the official Olympic program after execution , difficulty level and `` flight time . ''
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
The most common Olympic vector is straight .
Medal hopefuls must go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and forth , up and down in the playground .
Not only are they hunting the finishing line or the starting wall , but also in television broadcasting another heightened goal : that of the world or of the Olympics .
The purposeful pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatical - and it 's enough to even stir a spectator to tears .
But it 's also what I feel as something tiring even when watching these games .
Of this , the trampoline offers a breathing space .
The vector of the trampoline controller is above .
A forward movement is not the goal .
He or she collides , seemingly heavy-handed like an astronaut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back up .
Here , too , there is competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dreamy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It 's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
The women 's qualifying and final will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13,00 Eastern Time ; that of men on Saturday , also at 13,00 .
NBC will broadcast the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14,00 .
Amid the Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult .
If the increase in awareness can only be achieved by the anxiety and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner suggested recently , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan community to be rushed to air .

French court rejects offer over demolition of shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais Jungle where thousands of refugees live .
At a court hearing this week , authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to tear down 72 provisional deals where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer hairdressing services , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or simple meals for a few€ in provisional restaurants .
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and sanity .
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
They also carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional deals , but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were `` absolutely understandable . ''
The judge , Jean-François Molla , said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who `` live in extremely precarious conditions . ''
He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places threatened by the defeat was the Jungle Book Kids `` Café of the camp , which is operated nonprofit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultancy on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors in the camp .
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to uphold the kids `` cafe .
In a letter to the Guardian , it said that the closure would be `` a disaster for these children , the youngest of whom are eight years old . ''
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L `` Auberge des Miert estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer .

Britain picks up silver in 7 -er rugby after Fiji Masterclass catches gold
Britain 's impressive performance at the 7 -er rugby came in the final on Thursday night to an abrupt hold at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a 43 - 7 result at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji issued a masterclass in the handling , side-stepping , retrofitting , line run and raw force to win gold - their first Olympics medal of any colour .
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain 's fourth that day - and they were able to be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
The clear defeat of the Boks , 7 - 5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
But regardless , Fiji would have beaten a 15 -man team in best form at that form .
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably wo n't - that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fiji 's chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind .
Eight years ago , they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan .
Here they lost only one .
This sap will hurt , but progress is astonishing .
Fiji began miraculously , leaving the attacking GBs out of fun .
It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running into driving buses , and the World Series winners went up 5 - 0 when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner .
With still four minutes of game time , Jerry Tuwai added yet another attack from the right corner he converted .
12 - 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
A hevorraging Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa reaching a third gate , but it only held up Fiji .
In the seventh minute , Jasa Veremalua lured a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0 - 17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new one since the rematch and there was still over a minute of game time ... In the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou pressured through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stumbled down to the line to make a gate .
The conversion brought a 29 - 0 to the break .
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning .
That is the way it is .
GB carried out fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap ... For whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji .
Dan Norton launched a try for GB , made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36 - 7 , but the game has long been in favor of the South Seasons , whose fans sang , flags swapped and danced in the grandstand .
It was not hard to admire Fijis `` playful approach .
Mata Viliame set the i-Tüpfelchen with another try in the final seconds .
The Pfiff tweeted , the Fijis hugged himself and GB kicked devastated in the lawns .
Earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20 - 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Britain 's transformation of the difference .
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 -Aside team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .

The U.S. wins fourth match in women 's field hockey , a showdown with Britain faces
A day after she shot three goals during a 6 - 1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women 's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 - 0 .
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but Bam ( 27 ) said she could not remember having ever done that .
`` I have no idea , '' she said .
I 'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind .
However , she knows this : the Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4 - 0 and are in their group with the British in the first place , who remain unbeaten after their 2 - 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals , the game will decide which of the two within their group from six teams will each gain first and second place .
The first-place finish will be a little longer out of the way that the other group cites .
Whatever the game may be on Saturday , Americans have sparked a surprising hurricane through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BAM was part of that team .
She grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey sleeper in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player of the United States , the youngest in the team 's history .
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could n't qualify for the cadre .
Then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
In the following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , became a coach of the national team , and so things began to turn to better .
`` A change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , '' said Bam .
We did n't have the workload in London that we have now .
We 've been able to rip the helm completely .
On Thursday night , Bam opened the goalkeeper in the first half of the game with a retreat from the close range .
India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team were surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1 - 0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands .
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved into the middle and lugged the ball into the gate to give American women a 2 - 0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the United States goalkeeper , Jackie Briggs , who so far had to have a gate in each of the previous games .
She has a run .
Just like Bam .
`` We 're in a good position '' said Parnham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .

To punish , police set up several strip crews as well as a police helicopter .
The punishment went without success .
Perhaps the unknown in front of the apartment was close to the apartment or when it was fleeing .

Mahaj Brown , 6 , `` extinguished by bullets , '' survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police agree that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot .
The boy 's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown .
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including in the Lend , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at the hospital when he was transported to the hospital .
`` He went through a lot , his little body was sparked by bullets , '' his grandmother , Delores Melendez , told the broadcaster .
I just ca n't believe that .
The boy 's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
The boy 's family informed the broadcaster that he is expected to recover .
He should have started the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown .
Three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 -year-old .
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition , according to CBS Philadelphia .
The boy was found hooked up on the front seat of a car along with the 29 -year-old , who is in a critical condition , reports the broadcaster .
The other two victims were not in the car and police are just investigating whether or not to be among one of the injured men of the perpetrators .
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it appeared to have come to a crossfire between several shooters .
Patron hulls for storm rifles traced to various storm guns overturned the scene .
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing fight .
On the road , on both sides of the road , there were sleeves .
There seem to have been several armed fighters involved here , who were very actively involved , `` police chief Anthony Ginaldi told police in Philadelphia to the broadcaster .
Several houses and vehicles have also been hit in the area .
There were no arrests and police are currently reviewing reports of the surveillance video .
On Tuesday , another 6-year-old girl was hit by a squatter at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane .
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect .

Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had established ISIS had been `` sarcasm ''
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by indicating that his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the `` founder '' of the Islamic State terror group had not been serious .
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate 's communication skills , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public .
It also brings his co-workers , who are trying to protect him during an eventful period , into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all .
After making the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night , Mr. Trump resigned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS .
But in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic .
The tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation was completely serious .
When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump mitigate the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
The last storm of criticism prone to Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling polls .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried to return to the issue again .
Speaking on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has already put forward sarcasm to his defense .
At the end of July , he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but he later declared `` of course I meant the sarcastic . ''
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rub back as needed .
`` I think it 's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , '' clarify `` depending on how the reaction is out . '' Said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates .
I also believe , however , that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Trump has adopted an even more predictable tone , as his poll values have continued to decline .
A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist , released on Friday , showed a lead with big lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida .
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologise for his provocative remarks , he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour .
But while he is stepping up the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's jokes have put his loyal co-workers in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him , regardless of how provocative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , a former mayor of New York and one of Trump 's most prominent advocates , gave himself great trouble to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview Thursday .
`` I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments '' said Mr. Giuliani he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump 's statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them backbenchers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled off the troops from Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively bringing the situation in the Middle East under control .
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and being biased against him .
He mocked the `` poor , jolly '' television experts who try to understand him and said , `` you ca n't ! . ''
Some of the Democrats spotted Mr. Trump 's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency .

Rain rather than star snuggling : hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star snuff Guckers in south-west Germany a stronghold by the bill on the night of Friday - but there is still hope .
The night was badly suited for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , the chairman of the star warden Welzheim , Hans-Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
Our hope is on the night of Saturday .
The weather is supposed to be good , then we 'll certainly see a lot of star snuff in the sky .
The star shoes are Perseids , which , at 216,000 kilometres per hour , are among the fastest star snuff .
They have their name because they seemingly come from the star image of Perseus , which goes up in the northeast .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the coach 's cancer to rowing victory
There will be no more emotinous gold than in those games and that 's what what is going to mean .
From the first rowing strike to the last , 220 hard Hieve , who go down in history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa .
Even though it was only the ones who sat at the helm , there were three votes in the boat , the echo of the coach Robin Williams , who was alluding to the second Olympiagold in two without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport who put such a scale .
Their dominance was absolutely , after all , their 39th unbeaten use , which is also unprecedented .
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all , when cancer was diagnosed with him .
As he said , he 's risky .
I had bladder cancer that is operable and that they did .
If you do n't , he 's spreading everywhere .
It would have been a pretty bad situation .
It changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio were lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so it had to go better again soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice .
That 's how it starts .
Rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
In the immediacy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
Stanning , who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a bet in Afghanistan , said `` I was an emotional wreck this week , which is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . ''
It only repeats how much this means to me , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked .
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him , he is the best coach in the world .
I would n't have wanted a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years .
The pair had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could n't keep up .
Even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open up , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were very caught at the moment .
Helen called `` stay in the process , stay in the process . ''
It is really important not to get involved .
We had a good start and at the same time we were n't looking to make some tolls .
We did n't want a fireworks today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did as well .
The pair will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glover must appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall .
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did n't want to say that was my last race .
That would have meant too much pressure .
In London , it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
Here it took about four minutes .
That feels so much better , `` she said .

Police set up tear gas & rubber shells against protesting Brazilian students
Students joined the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate against the government 's reforms for the public education system .
Police set up tear gas and rubber shells against the protesters .
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart , resulting in the police deploying rubber shells and tear gas .
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans .
According to proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money .
Some of the protest participants looked at graffiti against the provisional president , Michel Temer , on walls .
The latest protests took place a few days after protesters took to the streets in masses to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff , who had been unveiled by a vote of the Senate to her defiance from office .

Clinton 's and Trump 's economic policies in comparison : it 's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal - that 's what both Clinton and Trump want .
However , the two U.S. presidential candidates are divided on fiscal and energy policy , as well as on a fundamental issue .
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical , difference .
The , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small , and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
He himself , on the other hand , would be very different , Trump claims .
He will cut back on regulations massively , and he is strongly committed to wide-ranging tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , on the other hand , says that the state has certain tasks to perform , it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
That 's why taxes would be increased for the rich , she says .
Interestingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
In the need to be invested , Trump and Clinton say almost worthwhile .
The democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics , and are , for example , strictly rejected by the Republican state 's state-run Teaparty wing .
So , on Trump , bipartisan discussions could still be held .
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal production in the U.S. again .
Oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas , and the Paris climate change agreement is intended to terminate it .
Clinton , on the other hand , explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program , calling for `` a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs . ''
`` It will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . ''
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
TPP , the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement , both do not want to sign .
At the same time , however , both do not want to isolate the U.S. from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
They should then be paid better , for example , for Clinton .
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 is a hunger wage .
It wants to raise it to $ 15 a hour .
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to go up , then he says he should not be altered .
But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps .
On one side is Trump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
His critics believe that this would only increase the budget deficit .
On the other hand , Clinton , who , at least , wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .

London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS , died in Syria .
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa , Syria a few weeks ago .
It was believed she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa , the group 's bulwark in the country , ITV News reported on Thursday .
Sultana was 17 years old and died , according to her family , shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England .
`` One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - discouraging people from ever making that decision , '' Akunjee said .
In February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London rose into a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultana 's family have been told she has married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .

Supercup : Barca with worries against Seville
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is battling for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday .
The Catalans are stepping out in the duel around the Spanish Supercup against the FC Sevilla , the replay rising three days later at the Camp Nou .
The Doublegewinner has to renounce in the balance of power with the subdued cupfinalist and reigning Europa League champion among others on Neymar , who denies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
Also missing is goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen .
In training , the German suffered a change in the knee in the knee , clarifying the question at Barca at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bravo .
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been betting in Barcelona for two years for status as number one .
Coach Luis Enrique has so far waived a clear decision , leaving Bravo in the league , but Ter Stegen in most other applications .
Before the first compulsory game of the new game season , there is doubt at the Spanish champion about the fitness state of the team , which was humiliated on Saturday in a Test match by Liverpool with 0:4 remaining .
Even at 3:2 in the Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday , Lionel Messi and Co. still did n't really know .
Seville , in turn , has to digest the 2:3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the `` Supercopa de Espana . ''
Barcelona is with so far eleven successes of the record winners in this application .

Escape : `` every whipped woman has experience of sexual violence ''
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone .
When they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatised .
A house offers refuge .
In a large kitchen , four women sit .
Each has a baby that is at most a year old .
One has put her little son in the arm .
He guys with great eyes curious into the room .
His mother stares at the table plate .
Until she notices she is being watched .
She smiles short and kisses the little one .
The scene works normal .
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr .
She is the managing director of Condrobs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with , among other things , the issue of women on the run .
The four women in the kitchen are poultry .
They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised shelters for all-embracing women and their children in Bavaria .
In January , Condrobs made up the establishment along with Pro Familia and the Munich Women 's Aid .
It has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
Men do n't exist - even as visitors .
The exception is a guard in front of the door .
`` It is not exaggerated to say : every woman arriving here has had experience of sexual violence on her flight , '' says Bahr .
`` Men are fleeing for wars because they are being pursued politically because they are threatening torture or death or because their families are sending them to Europe as a hopper , '' she says .
In the case of women , there are other reasons for the escape : `` many are stealing secretly because they do not see any other way out . ''
In their homeland , they have made experience of sexual violence , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
That is what is driving them .
On the run , that goes on .
`` For example , that smugglers are demanding a sexual activity for a bottle of water is not a rare occurrence , '' says Bahr .
And women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
Anyone who thinks that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , is mistaken , tells Bahr .
Here , too , single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst abused .
That leads to about 90 percent of women living in the shelter in Munich 's north , she estimates .
`` Some of the children have certainly not been voluntarily created . ''
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
`` Or they do n't trust to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . ''
As they often do n't know to help , it needs more shelter only for them , calling for Bahr .
In Bavaria , the seven county governments are responsible for accommodating refugees .
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence , some responded with no .
In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken , for example , there is no such thing in government shelters .
Even in swabs , only fled women are not submerged separately , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , the government 's press secretary .
In Oberbayern , Unter- und Mittelfranken , there are floors or own houses in some Community accommodation only for single women and their children .
The exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central shelters exclusively for women .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men .
In a study published for the committee , it says : `` it is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately . ''
`` Lack of privacy , or men and women are housed together , can come to - perpetual - violence against women . ''
In particular , the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen at the Andrank , which there is on the house in Munich .
`` Since it has been around , we have a long waiting list , '' says Bahr .
You could easily make up a second house .

Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2 % federal taxes
On Friday , Hillary Clinton released her tax return for 2015 , which revealed for the Democrats `` presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 % .
In 2015 , the Clintons donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $ 5.3 million in speech honors ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of $ 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure in the foreign ministry .
Clinton 's candidate for the vice presidency , Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia , along with his wife Anne Holton , is publishing his tax returns over the past decade .
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
`` Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , '' Clinton 's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion .
In a stark contrast , Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
`` They are on the train , '' Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter , referring to the release of the Democrats `` presidential candidate .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump 's special adviser , said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax exams are not completed .
Trump 's critics , including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth , his donations for charitable organizations , his business conduct , and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already rushed to the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump is calling for his tax return to be published .
On Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
`` He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . '' She said to the crowd .
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990 s for two years , and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday saying that that could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett , who would make sure people pay the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska , Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has his seat , called for Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
Buffett said he had also undergone a tax review of the IRS and Trump had `` fear '' in front of voters and not in front of the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax returns back to 2007 .
The Clintons , now living in Chappaqua , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
The Clintons `` tax return of 2015 showed that these only amounted to USD 100 of their income as a wage , unlike most of the Americans .
Their main asset was a low-cost index fund , from which Clinton 's dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 were taxed .

Crazy after Kates cycling doppelgänger and other famous doppelgängers of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come out this week over the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot , out of edge and band , who has proved to be an impressive doppelgänger of the Duchess of Cambridge .
But the 24-year-old Olympicist is far from the only one to have gold struggling athlete who has his own famous doppelgänger - at least not if you are allowed to believe in social media .
In honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces currently flimming on our screens , FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood fame .
The hunter and wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch shooting Brady Ellison , left , has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate 's doppelgänger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain arch protector could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio .
The team member of the U.S. team in arch shooting Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star intriguingly similar .
In fact , the arch protector got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
`` I do not see a great similarity , except for facial hair , '' Brady told the Huffington Post .
`` He is a good-looking guy , so I am a compliment . ''
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt be even more focused this year : the upsetting similarity between British wife Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
Russian turner Aliya Mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , is expected to be able to go through as a doppelgänger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan .
And in the swimming pool , South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years .
A gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the `` athletic version '' of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett , who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips .
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova dismisses more than just the sun-drenched skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord , while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to equal a `` athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt . ''
Strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one : one Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the similarities
Theory put in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the pair 's resemblance
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that `` the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical . ''
Indeed , the U.S. soccer star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes .
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney , as well as the gold medal winner in the turkey Gabby Douglas , which features her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

Steel - Light for German steel industry
The crisis-hit and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of€ .
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from eco-electricity support are off the table .
In the case of the liberation of the renewable-energy levy in the stock systems for the so-called equity production in the German steel industry , German Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the `` West German General Newspaper '' ( WAZ , Friday edition ) said .
`` I am really pleased that we have finally managed to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . ''
As a result , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
The steel industry threatened additional costs of between 120 and 240 million€ per year , according to the German industry association .
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission following talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants that an EEG levy of 20 percent is applied .
This , too , is not being raised in the steel industry .
The IG Metal welcomed Germany 's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of equity .
As a result , the status quo of the previous scheme is largely enshrined .
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are particularly important .
`` With regard to our '' steel `` campaign , this is a first step . ''
`` Others must follow . ''
`` Climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emissions trading , '' said IG Metal Chief Executive Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressures since the 2008 financial crisis .
Last year , the situation further intensified when the world 's largest producer of producers threw mass steel into the world market , given the weakening domestic demand .
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations of price dumping .
In the course of this spring , the situation has been somewhat relaxed .
On the one hand , import tariffs on import steel have been effective and , on the other hand , the economic outlook in China has arisen .
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday .
Most recently , prices would have been more stagnant .
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude closures of individual works .
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
In July , German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
They produced a good six percent less crude steel with 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous month , as the Stahl Economic Association announced on Friday .
After a short increase in May , the crowd now declined the second month in succession .
Since the beginning of the year , production has been up by two percent below the previous year 's level .
In the coming months , the association expects an increase in the volume of orders .

Berlin / Schwerin : poll before country elections : SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU .
This resulted in representative surveys of the INSA opinion research institute for the `` picture '' newspaper ( Friday ) .
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely continue to govern , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
In both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to put the head of government .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
The party , according to the survey , would only be just ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD .
The left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.4 per cent ) , the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country 's day .
The Greens are reluctant to return to the heavyweight Landtag , despite slight losses at 6 percent ( previously 8.7 per cent ) .
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each .
According to the Berlin Chamber of Deputies , the SPD would only be 23 % ( election 2011:28.3 % ) .
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent .
It would still be behind the Greens at 19 percent ( 2011:17.6 per cent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.7 per cent ) .
The AfD would be represented at 14 % for the first time in the House of Deputies .
With 5 percent , the FDP could hope for a return , but the pirates would miss the entry , as opposed to 2011 .

Jennifer Aniston : I 'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does n't always have to be perfect or successful .
That 's what the Hollywood star has now made unequivocally clear in an interview .
`` I always get stuck in drawers or get glued from the outside label , which has little to do with me and the reality . ''
`` I myself do not want to be perfect and successful . ''
`` Frankly , these things are more snug to me . ''
Jennifer Aniston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered a `` Miss Perfect '' as she explains in the current `` Cosmopolitan . ''
After all , the actress spends her time at home , premiering TV with loose Dutt and Mexican food , the magazine says .
To the white glut , they raise the question of children 's desire : `` we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , '' according to the Hollywood Star .
In her new movie `` Mother 's Day - Love is not a Children 's Game '' Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
The film runs with us from 25 August .

Destination Platten : who actually buys records ?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates .
Before rushing to the commentary in order to overthrow it under the pseudonym non-AlleEinsamenmen Mittlerenage with rough insults , this statement derives from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-discussed resurgence of records is not on a boom in Millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical items , but due to midlife nostalgia .
Those who recently bought a plate are likely to be aged between 45 and 54 .
In fact , the 18 - 24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group .
It is also not a horden by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But do YouGov 's results vote ?
If this blog were a news report on television , the camera would follow me while running in the midst of a busy street in Soho , wearing a modest grey suit and stealing wildly before standing , holding my hands and saying something like : `` so , let 's take a closer look at it . ''
So , let 's take a look at it .
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetation through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I have from Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three middle-aged men ) to Reckless Records ( data number : eight middle-aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
`` I already appreciate , '' he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
These records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap by email , I did n't follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy plates he could n't afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and bankrupt .
`` A lot of things I buy are from the late 60 s , early 70 s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 , things where I was probably a little too young to buy them , '' he says .
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and happy to spend time alone , and adds : `` I do n't smoke and I do n't drink very much .
That 's my laster .
WEZ , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media hub , people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy their old plates again .
Of the conversations I have had , people have usually devoured so at 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again , `` he says .
That would explain the boom to supporters of the record revision of a certain age .
But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realise that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people .
According to Wez , some of the older customers took impetus to the contactless payment system .
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar soundproofing hulls , from items that wake up happy youth movements .
`` I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation , '' says Wez .
This is the case with me as a collector and I think that is the case with many people .
It 's an easy way to look at it mentally .
`` We are like their social workers ! '' An employee is flying from a record stack .
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a plate last month have not yet listened to them .
The survey also found that 41 % possess a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate do not own a record player .
At this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while bleeding through a stack to Bossa Nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three middle-aged men ) , has noticed a `` trophy aspect '' of the revival .
`` Someone came here only recently and said : '' I do n't have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put them on the shelf , `` he says .
This is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
More product-like , less musical .
We have people who say , `` I do n't have a record player . ''
These are younger people , not older ones , who are slowly coming in .
Fopp , which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records , has a blower audience when I 'm talking .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenage young and middle-aged women .
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts ' latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drenched from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
None of them looks particularly lonely , but nagging mental trauma is hard to detect if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been running around in the shop for a few minutes and considers the varietal of the plates for sale .
It makes a storytelling rather than a big purchase .
She does n't deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It 's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... `` she drives off with a loved sigh .
I do n't know how to explain it - it 's really unique .
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Outfitters .
While I look to muster the jeans hotpants , I watch a group of young teenage girls grooming for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player .
To the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
It is pure `` record art . ''
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
It 's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates .
Even though my investigation revealed that the results of YouGov are voting , they leave , at least in record stores in Soho , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and in online forums .
These people probably work hard at school or in offices .
They are certainly not spending their Thursday morning with the bump through record shops of Berwick Street and the blazing through plates while avoiding the starring look of an intriguing , 30-year-old false presenter who raises over the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men .

CBC commentator for the Olympics apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer `` died like a pig ''
Byron MacDonald 's analysis on the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4 x200m freelance swimmers outraged viewers of the CBC 's Livetransfer of the Olmypical Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer `` went off like Mief '' and during the race like `` a pig died . ''
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was switched off when he handed out his own opinions at the end of the 4 x200m freelance swimming pool .
Macdonald , who had been picked into the CBS 's commentator team to lend more `` colour , '' could be heard saying : `` this little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . ''
Too excited , went off like Mief , died like a pig .
Thank you for that .
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan , 14 , swam the second stage of swimming staffing 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada 's Taylor Ruck , allowing the Canadians to close the gap to China .
Viewers across Canada quickly reacted online after they were shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted , `` has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China '' died like a pig `` ? ? ?
The idiot did not capture that they were still on broadcast. ``
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200 m outdoor swimming pool for women : `` this little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection , baby . ''
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came swiftly and hard , at which many put it to the speech
Twitter users did n't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user , Sarah Paradis , wrote : `` WoW , \ HASH ByronMacDonald .
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists .
A short time later , Scott Russel , who moderated the CBC broadcast , apologised live for MacDonald 's comment , saying : `` we apologise that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . ''
It was an unfortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened. ``
CBC apologised at the end over 90 times at the people who replied to the Bemerkt via Twitter
The commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC coped and added his apology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald 's comments
The network also apologised quickly and issued a communication .
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
We quickly apologised to our viewers last night on broadcast and our followers on social media .
To make one thing clear , Byron 's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person .
Yet they were inappropriate and an unhappily chosen wording ; Byron is very sorry about what he said .
On Thursday afternoon , MacDonald apologised in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that she be interpreted as a personal attack .
`` I 'd like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women 's swimming squad in the CBC Olympics , he said .
`` I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person . ''
Of course , no disregard was intended and I am very sorry. ``

Community , spirit , health : singing does seniors well
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the Lehram studies she belted the compartment music , and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior chorus .
`` Singing moves me - emotionally and physically , '' she describes .
After a probe , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more alive , she says .
By the way , she does something good about her health and her mind .
Because singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league .
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music , describing Hackler .
Through regular interaction , seniors can establish and maintain social contacts .
Because often social and family structures are settled in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir : `` to speak out and to organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association . ''
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense , Hackler says .
Because in doing so , seniors train a deep and controlled breathing .
Those who regularly call for their lungs do not get out of the puste as quickly as they are in everyday life .
Even when it comes to getting the sound of voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby .
On older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula Lenz from the federal Labor community of senior organisations .
In the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time .
By means of lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia sufferers are devoid of long-standing events .
In the case of singing , a special performance is also required for the head , Lenz explains .
At the same time , focusing on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm , adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
Just elderly people who live alone do not just focus on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the chorus , Hackler says .
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir .
To show yourself : if I long for something , I will be better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens .
So there 's good reason to start singing , so there 's enough .
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , Lenz advises .
You are not singing alone - with 50 singing people , who is listening when a tone goes on ?
In search of the suitable offer , seniors have different options , Hackler says .
Sings someone from the familiar circle in a senior chorus , you can easily join .
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area .
If you want to sing in a church choir , you can turn directly to the municipality or the church .
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the Internet search .
Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises Hackler .
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age .

Asocial family destroys social housing in Saltash , Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a deluge with a £50,000 damage because it had terrorised their neighbours .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash , Cornwall , according to a long list of complaints .
After being violently removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition .
The walls pointed out glowing holes , wooden dieles were ripped up , rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls .
The family have been resettled and it is believed she now lives in a private shelter
Donna McEvoy , who works for house administration at Cornwall Housing , said she fears the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
She said : `` It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people do n't have to live in this way .
There are many things to take into account , as this property will probably be seen as not such a beautiful part of Cornwall .
The family is notorious and their reputation is also .
The pair had three sons who lived in the flat in the meantime and police said that the terror that had inflicted on the family included street fighting with baseball blasts , intimidation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive cries , strikes and flight .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June .
In some rooms of the house , which will be demolished in circumstances , old rubbish was found
It has been ripped up in the property where drugs have been traded in the past
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be regularly called to the police
Cornwall Housing deleted her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out .
The deluge was cheered by facilitated neighbors who said their lives were being made to hell .
One said : `` they did not care about anyone . ''
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable .
`` This morning we could not sleep . ''
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we 're not accustomed to that !
Now that they are finally away , it will be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said that it would have failed the family to cooperate with local authorities .
The family lived in the house , to which police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house , rubbish and old toys were thrown down
He added : `` it is a disgrace that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as a deluge is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing .
This was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work done by my team , the police of Devon and Cornwall , as well as members of the community who have been courageous on us and have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will give consolation to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .

Workers of house administration will now have to remove rubbish mountains that surround the house
In 2014 , police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70 g of cannabis , as well as scales , paraphernals and cash of £1,700 .
Skeldon was given a fine after she pleaded guilty to the possession of a drug B drug in trade view .
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son , Lee Skeldon , who died in a car crash in 2013 .
After they were without a shelter , it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
Many room walls of the house were decorated with graffiti .
Police say it will delight tenants who do n't stick to the house order
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall Police announced that the deluge was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not abide by the house order .
`` This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusations and to those who have been damaged by such behaviour , '' she said .
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Kepler misses rotation rate of stars in Plejades `` star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades star .
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars in star clusters are rotating at different rates and in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary formation .
`` We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , '' said Luisa Rebull , a researcher at the Caltech 's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The star cluster of the Plejades is 445 light years away from Earth .
Many stars in this star cluster , which emerged around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adulthood .
They are now turning the fastest .
At peak rates , these maturing stars encounter large quantities of star winds .
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
When a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow .
Kepler misses the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a discernible star fleck -- such as sunshine .
The latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that more massive stars are turning more slowly than fewer massive stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones .
`` In the '' ballet `` of the Plejades , we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars , '' Rebull said .
As the star cluster of the Plejades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
`` The star cluster of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , '' Rebull said .
There is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How , When and Why stars slow their rotation rates and hang up their `` dance shoes . ''
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades , which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal .

Condoms with Chilipuder , fireworks promote Tanzanian elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going into settlements inhabited by humans - they throw condoms at them filled with chilipuder .
The method has proven to be effective , and the Honeyguide Foundation , which had the idea to do so years ago , has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals .
Previously , many spears used to defend themselves .
Friday is world telephone day dedicated to animal welfare .
`` Since we developed the ... toolkit , we have been able to observe a change in attitude within these communities , making them much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant , '' said Honeyguide 's managing director Damian Bell in a statement .
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blistering into a horn .
If he is not deterred , a so-called `` Chiliwolke '' will be thrown .
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom , the end of which is turned down to the ignition .
When it is ignited , the condom bursts with a bang and sprints fine dust to Chilipuder into the air .
A whiff quite usually already out to chase the elephant .
One last possibility is an advertiser that shoots a golfing fireworks into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

Patrick Roy resigns as coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led to minor co-determination in the team 's decision-making process .
Alternate President/General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
`` In the last three years , I have met my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , '' said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion .
I have been thinking long and a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level .
To achieve this , the trainer 's vision and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
He must also have a co-determination right in decisions that affect the team 's performance .
These conditions are not being met at the moment .
Sakic , who hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked him for his contributions to the team .
`` Patrick has informed me of this decision today , '' said Sakic .
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was honored during his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the league 's best coach .
He led the club to 112 points and to first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota and missed the postseason in each of the last two years .
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper , Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .

Russia 's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff , Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov has been part of Putin 's closest confidant for many years .
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Envoy for Environmental and Transportation Affairs .
In an opinion from the Kremlin , it is that , without giving reasons , Putin `` ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . ''
Anton Vaino , who has been Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo .
The Kremlin 's website says ( in Russian ) that he was later the chief executive and chief executive of the government staff .
On his appointment , he said to Putin : `` thank you for your confidence . ''
I think that it is the government 's most important task to support your activity as head of state on draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and advised Vaino as his successor .
Do you see the smiling faces ?
This move has kept Moscow shrouded in mystery .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin 's closest confidants and works like he did for the Soviet secret service , the KGB .
As chief of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
At a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request .
But despite the smiles for the cameras , few are convinced here - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
So is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
Nobody knows that at the moment .
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president would want to head Russian environmental policy at once - met with great skepticism .
In his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Kremlin website , Ivanov said `` it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - arduous posts for four years .
As it turns out , I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov took the post in December 2011 .
Previously , he was deputy prime minister and defense minister .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the KGB State Security Service .
In the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , which replaced the KGB , Ivanov was appointed to his deputy .
When Putin came to power , he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most .
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin 's second term , as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution .
But this post was taken by another , close ally of Putin , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later .

Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs it incurred from the Hepatits C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc .
In June , Gilead was freed from a $ 200 million compensation payment for violating two patents of Merck and Harvoni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misconduct by Mercks , including the Meineides and other unethical acts .
In elevating the lawsuit filed Thursday , U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to enactment of the charges incurred during the defense of the case .
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
The case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and took ownership of laboratory work involving Sofosbuvir , the active ingredient in Gilead 's medications .

Building ground in double pack
With issues surrounding construction , the local council has focused on the most recent meeting .
With relief , the panel adopted Mayor Robert Putz 's message that `` at last the marketing of the recently designated residential area can begin . ''
After clearing the land , parking and development issues and making the applications for surveying , the sale of the plots of land in the residential areas `` Road '' and `` Schönau-West '' ( Binderstraße - Explanation section 1 ) is no longer in the process of being sold .
The local council is convinced that the buildings in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and mature seniors alike .
As it was said , developers can now sign up at City Hall , the awarding of the parcels is expected to be discussed by the local council at its September meeting .
In order to be able to respond to requests for the settlement of further businesses , linked to the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to amend the land use plan , which was first created in spring this year .
In the area of Untertimlarn , the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two parcels in the direction of the state road 2112 .

It is constantly being screened in the name of the fight against terrorism .
After the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package .
But what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler .
All his proposals are `` politically reasonable '' to the coalition partner , says the federal interior minister at the presentation of his new security package .
They do not overdo anyone .
Other , more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
As interior minister , however , he is interested in results and in a `` achievable consensus '' within the coalition .
Following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach , de Maizière has missed a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic .
However , these are all the more extensive .
Something is already known , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new .
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapons law .
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is not surprising .
In part , de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that have not been made with the SPD : he wants to criminalize sympathy for terrorist groups and strip jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport .
`` That will be difficult points for the SPD , '' admits the CDU man .
He still thinks that this is reasonable and I do not ask for anything , which is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway .
A few new ideas also presents de Maizière .
They have it in part : it plans fast-track procedures for deportation and more opportunities to incarcerate people from deportation .
Refugees targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security review .
In the case of refuges for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity .
Some of it is politically and legally sensitive .
Some also do not work out and leave questions unanswered .
And on a number of points , where there is unequal treatment , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
Yes , de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
But it can not be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees .
Moreover , many people were worried about safety , given the high numbers of refugees .
And things that people deeply employed could not be left out in election campaigns .
Internal security has been very much in the spotlight .
First the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
There is a great deal of uncertainty .
And yes , there are election campaigns .
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security .
Over the past few days , it has been high between the two parties .
Only a gardening dispute over equipping the federal police , then over a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers , in which the department chiefs also call for a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship .
De Maizière is also looking for conciliatory tones .
He does not think there is any departure from the double pass .
We have been satisfied with the discussion in Germany .
To reopen it does not make sense .
And in a burqa ban , he has constitutional concerns .
Whether his own package is constitutional on all corners , and whether it is actually `` reasonable '' for the coalition partner , has yet to show up .
There is a lot in it that could cause a dispute .
But the SPD , too , is currently trying to capitalise on the issue of internal security .
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel has signalled a cautious willingness to talk and says : `` the SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security . ''

Scots Callum Skinner stormed home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men 's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris hoy had embraced and made the legend proud when he stormed home to capture a victory from New Zealand 's favourites .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympics medals .
They repeated the trick after they holed only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
They did so in good time as a hint .
Hoys 's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny - who won with hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standings the New Zealanders won in the first round .
And the British trio won the duel with gold .
Hindes fell short after his round , but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it .
A change of strategy made much of the transformation , in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and , above all , Skinner to keep the pace .
Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner , Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the podium .
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said : `` it is a flattering comparison . ''
I am just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
We set an Olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions .
It was just incredible .
There is no better way to win this .
After the 2012 triumph at Kennys and Hoys , Hindes admitted he deliberately fell on the train after a weak start .
He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England 's rivals .
This time there was no such problem with such a surprising victory .
Hindes said : `` it feels with all the GB flags in the gallery like London . ''
We have come together as a team in the last three months .
We have come away so badly in so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
That is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velodrome .
With the form of Kennys , it is in the realm of the possible that he repeats Hoy 's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than hoy , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently sacred date for British sport ; on the day were also born Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the equivalent of hoy .
Kenny is next in the sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said : `` I am enjoying this just for the moment . ''
The team event is always best .
You can win it with his colleagues .
It feels a bit lonely to win alone .
Hindes said : `` if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the knight . ''
It was the only medal contest of the day , but there was further good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race .
They came in at 3 : 51.942 on goal .
The world record holder , who won gold in London in 2012 , was third at 3 : 51.659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) will take place today on the second day of the contest , where Wiggins will certainly be in focus .
He had struggled with appointees before the qualification yesterday , when officials called him to measure his body size .
In the corresponding women 's competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4 : 13.260 .
The GB team relies on its strong rail cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a bar of medals .
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were lowered .
It played out drama in the background , according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations , as well as the retirement of sizes such as hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
But if you look at the first evening of the competition at the velodrome , it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBS , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .

London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza sultana , one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS , reportedly died in Syria .
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa , Syria , a few weeks ago .
It was believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa , the group 's bulwark in the country , ITV News reported Thursday .
Sultana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England .
`` One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - stopping people from ever making that decision , '' said Akunjee .
In February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London climbed into a plane heading towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultana 's family has been told that she has married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and , within a few months , became the widow .

Rescue at Moelfre Bay : three men ' lucky still alive '
Three men are `` lucky still alive '' after being thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey .

Olympics 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught : due to a positive doping test , Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases .
A caught athlete would have almost won a medal .
Before the seventh race day , the first official doping cases became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000-meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa of Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have been tested positive and ruled out in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions , these messages come at the untime .
Last Sunday , Chen showed the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid , which is used as a masking agent for doping substances .
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
On Sunday , the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100m butterfly , only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen should have taken part in the forerunners over 50 m free style .
Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
The National Association takes the matter `` very seriously and requires full cooperation in the investigations , '' Xinhua quoted a news release as saying : `` we will cooperate with the International Sports Tribunal CAS and will accept the verdict . ''
For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC , but the CAS responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases .
Also on the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample at Danekowa went through , the 33-year-old went into the offensive itself .
`` I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive '' , this was `` an incredible shock , '' she told the Bulgarian TV channel BNT .
She is innocent , '' the only explanation could be dietary supplements , '' the athlete said .
According to the report , the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO .
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended , according to BNT , the B sample has already been positive .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete .
`` I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , '' he said , adding : `` we Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been ruled out . ''
For example , all the weights from the chronically doping-impaired nation must not take part in Rio .
On Friday , the case was also known as `` Adrian Zielinski , '' the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tomasz tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier .
Both deny enrollment , but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
Before the start of the athletes , the Danekowa case is another major blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
The International Federation of IAAF had banned the entire Russian team except for systematic doping , and Kenya also produced a lot of bad news in Rio .
In swimming , the previous offense in China had also caused fierce clashes between athletes .
So the Frenchman , Camille Lacourt , attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly .
`` Sun Yang pinkelt purple . ''
`` When I see the podium over 200 m free style , I want to hand over , '' Lacourt said on French radio .
Sun was also at the centre of a dispute with the Australian Mack Horton .
`` I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters , '' this one said .
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant Trimetazidin at the Chinese championships in 2014 , but had to sit down only a three-month lock .

Despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in Olympic time , cycling professional Tony Martin does not want to be subdued .
`` I continue to keep the World Cup in mind , stay confident and fight on , '' the 31-year-old wrote Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
He does not have a statement for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar front .
`` I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday 's time , '' Martin said .
He had to analyse calmly the reasons for the debacle .
At the time World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin actually wanted to fight for the title .
`` I am going to look at everything that we have changed recently . ''
`` This includes my position , '' wrote the three-time time world champion who lost on Wednesday to the 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara ( Switzerland ) .

Adblock Plus , Facebook in ' cat and mouse game ' on ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to bypass ad blocking , a `` cat and mouse game '' are the same .
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop site , Adblock Plus published a blogpost in which it said users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding of its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect what part of the page is advertising .
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes .
In a blogpost , Adblock Ben Williams spokesman Ben Williams wrote that `` this kind of hit-and-go battle between the notifying open source community and the bypass has already been underway since the invention of ad blockers , '' and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's largest corporate social media company has entered the fray is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry .
Worldwide , according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe , about 200 million people use ad blockers ; nearly four times as much in 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebooks .
The company has it on ad blockers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook 's mobile app for the social network and Instagram , a spokesman said .
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient share of revenue , so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its `` ad preferences tool '' to give people more control over advertising aimed at them .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that Adblock 's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
`` For users , that is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , '' said a spokesman for Facebook in an e-mail message .
Ad blockers are a blunt means , which is why we have focused instead on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into people 's hands .

Despite doping : these athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been jailed twice for doping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .

Other overturned athletics scorers can only laugh at this - they are fighting in Rio for medals .
The issue of doping remains the headlines at the Rio Olympics .
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa , who complained about her starting right just before the Games after a doping ban , was mercilessly paused and booted out at her start ( 100 meters ) .

But there are many other athletes who go to the Olympic Games in Rio , despite the doping past .
Here is an overview :
Justin Gatlin ( 100 , 200 , 4x100-m-staple/USA ) : the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics .
He had already been jailed two times for doping ( in 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
Since his spell , the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion runs even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the biggest challenger by Usain Bolt .
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce ( 100 , 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaica ) : the two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit down a six-month lock in 2010 after it proved the intake of the painkiller Oxycodon .

Sandra Perkovic ( Discus/Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant medium methylhexanamine .
Perkovic denied the knowingly ingested and was jailed for six months .
The four widest worshippers this year go to the account of the big gold favorites .
LaShawn Merritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x400-m-Staffel/USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 metres , was positively tested in 2010 and jailed for 21 months .
One of the means of pencilling was responsible , Merritt said .
This year , the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the world 's fastest man so far .
Iwan Tichon ( Hammerthrow , Belarus ) : hardly an athlete has been deprived of so many medals afterward .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with trainer 's cancer to rowing victory
There will be no more emotive gold than in these games , and that is what they want .
From the first rowing strike to the last , 220 hard Hieve that went into history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa .
Even if it was only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat , the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , who was present at the second Olympics in succession without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport who set such a benchmark .
Their dominance was absolute , after all , their 39th unprotected use , which is also unprecedented .
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not reflect the nature of triumph .
Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and no one was more helpful than the coach who , 30 months ago , did not know if he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
As he said , he was risky .
I had bladder cancer , which is operable and they did .
If you do not , it is spreading everywhere .
It would have been a pretty bad situation .
It changes a little bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014 , outside the season , which kept the break to a minimum , in case that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough .
That is how it starts .
Rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
In the immediacy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a bit more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
Stanning , who was a principal in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said `` I was an emotional wreck this week , which is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . ''
It just repeats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin have worked .
It has been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him , he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have a better person to train or want a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years .
The pair had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
Even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were caught very much at the moment .
Helen called `` stay in the process , stay in the process . ''
It is really important not to get carried away .
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something Tolles .
We did not want fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which is what we did .
The couple will take a time-out for a year before making any decisions about his future .
Glover must appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall .
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that was my last race .
That would have meant too much pressure .
In London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
It took about four minutes .
That feels so much better , '' she said .

Airline not liable : fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf ( Az . : 18 U 124/14 ) .
The plaintiff had broken a knee ligament in the fall .
The accident , however , could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life , the court said .
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages .

Salzburg `` West Side Story '' with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the `` West Side Story '' with Tony and Mary as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Julia .
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
A musical conquered Salzburg : the `` West Side Story '' , Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece .
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of Classic and performed a youth dream with the role of Mary .
In the orchestra , the Simón Bolívar Orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel : `` this music is full of rhythm , '' he joked .
We always say that it is very Latin American .
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
It is a wonderful blend , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein 's music really in our blood !
In this staging , Bartoli plays an older Mary .
She remembers with sorrow at her favourite with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
The role of Mary has always fascinated me .
First , because it is musically exceptional !
And then there would be Marias personality .
She says it in her song : `` I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and witty and bright . ''
So she is wise , of course , also naive , and very passionate .
`` She is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , '' laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It is such an honour for us to work with her .
She is an immensely generous person .
And Bartoli returns the compliment : `` Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! ''
Conducting is a necessity for him .
You see it in any of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
We both have a rather southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
For American director Philip Wm . McKinley , the `` West Side Story '' is highly topical : `` this piece is about prejudice and fanaticism . ''
Today we have the refugees , then the Puerto Ricans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
These are the same issues , and they are as meaningful today as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Treats wants Nacktkalendar for `` women and for men ''
The Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017 .
But instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017 .
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differs from Oldschool-Playboys because `` Playboy is for men . ''
I am doing this for women .
He seems to believe that it does the calendar .
`` We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classical nudity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , '' Shaw said in a press release on the release of the calendars .
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York .

Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical battle on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced their dismissal in a joint statement .
Gibson , who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner , apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his dismissal .
On the set , there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion .
I regret the incident , '' he said in a statement .
Details of how Gibson 's character from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , will be released , according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios , likely to be released at a later date .
The 54-year-old , who previously played in the sitcom dharma & Greg , has been with it since the first season of the series in 2005 .
`` I love Criminal Minds and have plugged my whole cardiac arrest for the last 12 years , '' Gibson said in a message released Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will not be possible now .
I would just like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and , above all , the best fans you can only wish for a series .
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September .

Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS brand is about to be reduced to a back-office role , according to the bank 's CEO .
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank 's global ambitions .
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago .
During that time , brand strategist RBS has used `` RBS '' to protect other end-consumer financial brands .
She supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship , from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now it has decided to put more national brands in focus .
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all RSB references , the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest .
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other , smaller brands for retail banking that will be given more prominence - Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's Military Bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire .
He told BBC Scotland : `` the RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be busy as we become more a bank of brands now . ''
As the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became a global brand .
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global objectives , but local objectives .
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
`` It is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus on inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? '' said the CEO .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
We can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

The fee per cubic metre of waste water is from 1 October 2016 for the area of Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro ; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euro ( previously 2.26 Euro ) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros ( so far 2.18 euros ) .
At the Azendorf plant , the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are needed .
After an over-the-counter calculation , the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre .
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser ( CSU ) reported , when the budget was approved by the Landratsamt Kulmbach , it was found that these waste water plants were going to be covered .
The Kasendorf market is obliged , on the basis of a legal basis , to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner .
From 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial and industrial enterprises from Welshkahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse .
Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
As the managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel , a new calculation of the charges for sewerage systems was necessary for the market community .
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overdrafts and undercoverings from the previous calculation period should also be compensated .
The serious increase in fees is based on the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small installations with very low waste water , which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
For example , due to the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be seriously affected .
There is also a slight decline in the volume of waste water in all three plants .
Furthermore , in the last period of calculation , significant amounts of rehabilitation and repair expenses have been incurred in all three plants , not least because of their age .
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Welschenkahl , Neudorf and Reuth , as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage plant , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage .
In the pumping plant of Welschenkahl , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be overtaken from scratch and , after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be used , the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be built in order to be able to comply with the water legislation in the future .
Schmidt : `` to these extraordinary expenses came the updated maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . ''
The same is true of electricity costs , which were well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 .
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants , the cost of operation and maintenance was `` fully beaten '' .
In addition , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water plants , has been spared over the past 20 years .
In the view of stone houses , the situation for these installations will remain precarious in the long term , especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater network in Friesenbachtal can not be extended because of the lack of facilities .

Donald Trump election campaign indicted after staff allegedly pulled gun
New York : Donald Trump 's campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina turned a firearm to an employee in February while traveling in a jeep in February .
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the District Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in that state .
Bordini admitted for months that the matter would be settled internally before realising that `` that would not happen . ''
The campaign manager , Earl Philip , '' drew a pistol , put his right index finger on the deduction , and rammed the run in Vincents Kniekehle , '' gave Bordini in his indictment .
After complaining to the local and regional campaign manager , Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip , he admitted in the indictment .
`` Guns do not have to be fired to cause damage , '' admitted Bordini .
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the `` second Amendment people '' - firearms owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should appoint .
Trump 's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence .
Bordini 's complaint calls for damages from the campaign for due diligence and Philip for bodily injury and sustained psychological damage .
Trump 's press secretary , Hope Hicks , was unable to reach an opinion .
Attempts to contact Philip also failed .
WCCB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer employees of the campaign .
Calls at his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , did not respond .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far held a controversial campaign .
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc. , 16-CS-14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

`` A generation protested '' in Ethiopia , Long a US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed in shootings during clashes with police .
Is Ethiopia in the process of collapsing ?
Over the last decade , it has been one of Africa 's most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy .
But in recent months , anti-government protests shook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
Last week , thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
The government 's response was ruthless , according to human rights organizations .
Witnesses said police shot and killed scores of unarmed protesters .
Videos in circulation about the protests , presumably from the last or earlier this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now asking for an in-depth investigation .
`` It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , '' said Rashid Abdi , the project manager of the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region , particularly in Somalia .
Ethiopia 's economy expanded at a considerable pace .
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa .
The streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
Although Ethiopia has been far from a model for democracy , human rights organisations have consistently led the government 's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissidents effectively silenced .
Many were sent into exile or in jail , killed or driven into the expanses of the desert .
But that could change .
`` If you suppress people and these no other options have other options besides protesting , it breaks out , '' said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
The whole youth protests .
A generation is protesting .
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to the stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticized election last year , the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
At the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea ; a battle for this treacherous , controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front , which have been more or less defeated in recent years , could exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves .
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode beneath the surface after years of gestation .
The first seems innocuous : smartphones .
It is only in recent years that many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media , as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and Internet services improved .
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying .
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since eons , the Amharas , who come from the predominantly Christian highlands , have prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos , many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas .
But even that is changing .
`` We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella , '' said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of Oromos .
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group , who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , the intelligence services , trade and politics .
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was Ethiopia 's prime minister until his death on an undisclosed illness in 2012 for 17 years .
He was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
Analysts say he was particularly savvy at seeing early signs of discontent and using special representatives to edit opponents and make them harmless .
`` The current regime lacks this fundamental skill , '' said Mr Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopia 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take Mr Meles 's position .
Unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say he does not have the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray .
Many worry that the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a revolt was in 2005 , after thousands protested against elections , which , according to analysts , appears to have been sworn in by the government and then stolen .
During the ensuing raids , many protesters were killed , even if they were less than in recent months , and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty .
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disgust of the Ethiopian government .
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month , protesters in Gondar , an amharic city run by Tigray conducted deals and the hatred toward the Tigray is becoming more common on social media .
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a strange position .
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced it had closed that base .
While the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
`` This , '' said Mr Abdi , '' is a very thin gratuity . ''

Group rises in start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people playing video games is a giant trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit .
The technology group buys the start-up Beam , which specializes in this hobby .
How much money is flowing for the acquisition , Microsoft did not notify it on Thursday .
Beam first went to the launch in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
You can watch others in the game , but you can also intervene yourself .
For example , they can give the players missions and face enemies and provide equipment .
The game giant Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports .
On the way to the global media event , Facebook is to help .
The advertising industry is already hoarding .
The staff of the start-up , which has its headquarters so far in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , are moving to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond , as beam co-founder and chief executive Matt Salsamendi said .
This means that the acquisition will not change for the customers .
According to Microsoft , Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console .
The market for live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly .
Well-known platforms are twitch and YouTube gaming .
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for nearly $ 1 billion .
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google Mother Alphabet .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : the first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communicator came onto the market .
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
It was thicker and bigger , so it was not good either .
On the contrary , it was pretty scary .
The built-in memory initially averaged eight megabytes , which would be enough today for about two Selfies with high resolution .
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes .
The `` Nokia 9000 Communicator '' came in exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
For a few euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the Communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the CeBIT computer fair in Hannover , Germany .
In fact , the new mobile phone could provide a lot for then-standards : SMS and e-mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the Communicator to reach .
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser , albeit agonizingly slow .
A calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the cellphone could be folded up like a laptop .
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen .
Pretty proud was the price : 2700 D-mark , so about 1400 euros .
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
No one was able to predict in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
Since then , everything has been different .
The smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled .
The market now dominates suppliers , all of which came much later than Nokia .
Always and everywhere online , this is everyday life for a lot of people .
In 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
About 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million pieces .
Global sales of equipment are around € 400 billion .
In addition , there are the good business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications groups .
Around the smartphone , an entire industry has now emerged .
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007 , when Apple chief Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at the Mac World .
He promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communicator , all easy to use by touch screen .
Apple 's winning streak began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , which dominated the market , had the downside .
They eventually disappeared , Blackberry has to fight .
The sayings now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung .
The smartphone is taken for granted 20 years after its invention .
On average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
`` We all need to learn to put the smartphone away , too , '' said Janina Kugel , in the Siemens board of staff .
Permanent accessibility is now a curse and a blessing .

Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games , the Zen des Trampolins
Wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympics .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable , a racing staple between competition and aspiration .
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stomach , stretched from the armor to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete .
You can not turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour 's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there is Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who is here for the first time at the Olympics and a women 's black with greats , could well have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer , Turner or even Fechter .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is battling gold in the Olympic trampoline .
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event the same .
Further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised : air pistols shooting , archery , badminton , Taekwondo .
We will always have the breast swim and may it be long .
But if I can make modest arguments for my particular darling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was perceived the last 16 years so sparingly that many of the ones I had interviewed did not know it is an Olympian type at all .
That could also be regional ignorance .
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round .
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices of the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women .
DONG Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline jump has a certain outsider charm , in part because for the unenlightened ear it sounds more appropriate for a clowning school than that for the Olympic Games .
At this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a naturalized enthusiast .
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonish citation of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of the tournament and diving , the two sports that essentially unites it .
The word `` trampoline '' comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as `` springboard . ''
Aspiring victors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to make a series of falling movements ( turning , hitting and saltos ) before they land on their feet .
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program after execution , difficulty and `` flight time '' .
Second-round athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
Medal hopefuls have to go further in their pursuit of gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the goal , sometimes back and forth , up and down the pitch .
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but also , in television broadcasting , another cavalier goal : that of the world or the Olympiarecord .
The purposeful pursuit is nobel , admirable , even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears .
But it is also what I find to be a bit tiring even when watching these games .
Of this , the trampoline offers a breathing space .
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up .
A forward movement is not the goal .
He or she jumps off , seemingly heavy-handed like an astronaut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly up again .
Again there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , just the dreamy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
The women 's qualification and final rounds will be held Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC will broadcast the Endrunden as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
In the midst of the Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult .
If consciousness can be achieved only by the angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner suggested recently , according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr Dooley awaits his fledgling , new fan base .

Jennifer Aniston : I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
That is what the Hollywood star clearly made clear in an interview now .
`` I will always be plugged into drawers or glued from outside labels , which with me and reality usually have little to do with it . ''
`` I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . ''
`` To be honest , these things are rather snuff to me . ''
Jennifer Aniston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered `` miss Perfect '' as she explains in the current `` cosmopolitan . ''
After all , the actress spends her time at home , TV with loose Dutt and Mexican food , the magazine says .
To the white glut , she raises the question of the child 's wish : `` we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , '' according to the Hollywood star .
In her new film , '' Mother 's Day - Love is Not a Children 's Game '' , Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
The film runs with us from the 25th of August .

Intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play `` The invisible House '' .
The association Nima 's and the boy theater are now planning a music project .
The association Nima 's enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
The `` class International '' of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece `` The invisible house '' of the boy Theatre Münster .
In the context of the `` Intercultural journey '' initiated by the association Nima 's , 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the staging in the small house .
Since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migrant and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project .
Most of the young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and spoke little German .
Thanks to the choreography , the scenic images and video animations , they were able to follow the course of action , according to the press release of the boy Theatre Münster .
The association Nima 's , founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg of Sprakel , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theater project .
From October to December , young people between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , spectacle and music .
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language placement are in the planning .
The project `` Intercultural journey '' continues .
Given the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .

How to protect yourself with krav Maga from gun attacks
The world out there is a dangerous place , but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you .
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi , a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance .
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber .
If you approach you from behind , you should first turn around so you can see your attacker and `` get out of the firing line , '' Mizrachi says .
Then take the gun between your suburb and your shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow .
Then beat him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the attacker crumbles in pain , hands the gun out of his hands , beat him with the run and move backwards while they turn the gun on him .
With attackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , seize the gun and twist it , so the attacker can 't shoot .
At the same time , shift the weight to the gun and beat the attacker to the chest , then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and put the gun on it .
Does it sound difficult ?
Watch the video to see exactly how it prefers Mizrachi .
But remember that , in a robbery , it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a krav Maga grandmaster .

Berlin/Schwerin : poll ahead of country elections : SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU .
This resulted in representative surveys of opinion research institute INSA for the `` Bild '' newspaper ( Friday ) .
While the red-black ruling coalition in the north could continue to govern narrowly , this is not possible , according to the survey figures in Berlin .
In both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to put the head of the government .
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
The party , according to the poll , was only slightly ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD .
The left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.4 percent ) , the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country Friday .
The Greens , despite slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , were returning to the Schweriner Landtag .
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each .
For the Berlin Chamber of Deputies , the SPD would be only 23 % ( 2011 : 28.3 % ) .
The CDU reached only 18 percent , after 23.4 percent .
They would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.7 percent ) .
The AfD would be represented in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time , with 14 % .
With 5 % , the FDP could hope to return , but the pirates would miss the move , unlike in 2011 .

Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in star cluster of Plejades
The newest mission with the Kepler Space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades ' star building .
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates in star clusters , as well as in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary structure .
`` We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , '' said Luisa Rebull , a researcher at Caltech 's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The star cluster of the Plejades is 445 light years away from Earth .
Many stars in this cluster of stars , created about 125 million years ago , now reach adulthood .
They are now turning the fastest .
At peak rotation rates , these mature stars produce large amounts of star winds .
As these winds travel through the stars ' magnetic fields , they have a braking effect on the stars .
When a star is aging , his rotation rate starts to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star flecks -- such as sunflecks -- .
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones .
`` In the '' ballet `` of the Plejades , we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars , '' said Rebull .
As the star of the Plejades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
`` The star cluster of Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , '' said Rebull .
There is much in front of us that we would like to know more about how the How , When and Why Stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their `` dance shoes '' .
Rebull and her colleagues have extensively reported in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the Pleijades ' rotation rates , which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal .

Assistant doctors strike : calls for new industrial action
Deputy Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labor action in their disputes over a new contract .
The Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has called on its entire council to approve more industrial action from early September .
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address concerns about the treaty .
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA .
It was rejected by 58 percent of its members who voted in the elections .
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , JDC 's chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained `` persistently calm '' on problems , adding that the treaty was rejected .
She said : `` in view of this , the JDC board voted to reject the proposed new treaty in full and called for official renegotiation to all your concerns . ''
In response to the government 's silence , the JDC board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor action , which begins in early September .
The disputes caused assistant doctors to strike six times this year , the first total outages in the history of the NHS .
The head of the BMA assistant physician Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract , which had been recommended by the BMA .
He told BMA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the treaty was beneficial and should be adopted .
After the vote , Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced .

Community , mind , health : singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she studied music and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir .
`` Singing moves me - emotionally and physically , '' she describes .
After a sample , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says .
By the way , she is doing something good for her health and her mind .
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives , says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League .
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music , describing Hackler .
Through regular meetings , seniors can establish and maintain social contacts .
Because social and family structures are often solved in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir : `` to speak out and organize , to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction '' .
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense , says Hackler .
Because of this , seniors train a deep and controlled breathing .
If you ask for your lungs regularly , you will not be able to get out of the pste as quickly as possible .
Even when it comes to getting the sound of voice in age , singing is an ideal hobby .
To older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula Lenz of the federal labor community of senior civil organizations .
In the older generations , the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explained .
Lenz frequently observed that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their teenage years .
Through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia sufferers remember long past events .
When singing , the head is also required to perform a special performance , explains Lenz .
To concentrate at the same time on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
Especially older people , who live on their own , do not just focus on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition of the singing in the choir , Hackler said .
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
Also , self-esteem grows by singing in the choir .
To show yourself : if I am long for something , I will get better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens .
Good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he feels to have little talent , Lenz advises .
You are not singing alone - at 50 singing people , who is listening when a sound goes next ?
In search of the appropriate offer , seniors have different options , says Hackler .
Singing someone from the acquaintance in a senior choir , you can easily join .
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area .
If you want to sing in a church choir , you can go directly to the town or church .
Many seniors can also be found on the Internet .
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors to help with the Internet search .
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir , advises Hackler .
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age .

Bomb blast in Thailand - Austrians injured - multiple deaths
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the Foreign Ministry spokesman , Thomas Schnöll , Friday morning .
She suffered cutting wounds and was treated in hospital , but has already been able to leave .
Her home trip was scheduled for early September .
It is still unclear whether the further explosions on the island of Phuket and the southern cities of Surat Thani , Phang NGA , Trang and Chumphon also affect Austrian citizens .
The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard , Schnöll said .
In the approximately 200 kilometers ( 30 miles ) south of the capital , Bangkok , Hua Hin was first seen exploding two bombs in a nightclub on Thursday night .
According to police , a Thai woman was killed and some 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning , two explosive devices went up again , and another person was killed , according to the authorities .
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the Badestrands Patong , which was popular with holidaymakers .
Another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the country 's southeast coast , killing an urban employee .
The explosive device had gone into the air , according to authorities in a flower shelter in front of the site of the coastal police .
Finally , detonations in Phang NGA and Trang on the southwest coast , as well as in Chumphon , on the southeast coast , claimed several injured .
One would go from a link to the explosions in Hua Hin , it said .
`` The bombings carry the same handwriting , '' said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists .
`` We assume that this is a coordinated attack . ''
It is too early to comment on possible motives , but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks , typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
The Thai police , however , said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or with international terrorism .
`` That is just local sabotage , which is restricted to limited areas and provinces , '' said a spokesman in Bangkok .
Rather , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta .
Authorities would have received intelligence evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country in the past few days - though they had not been informed of the exact timing and location .
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
Police instructed their officials across the country to step up security around key government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand , but they are mostly not against tourists .
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
After the current bomb explosions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
High security risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla , as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area .
There is no need to travel to these provinces after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations .
Increased safety risk ( Level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta .
It also gives the military great influence in the years to come .
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos as the country moves toward stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
The military unta , which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , is benefiting itself in bringing the kingdom back to stability and order .
However , the military has also failed to rein in the insurgency of Muslim rebels , which has been languishing in the far south of the country for years .
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
Just under a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists .
It was the bloodiest attack in the country 's recent history .

Britain pick silver in 7-man rugby after Fiji Masterclass gold Holt
Britain 's impressive performance at 7-under rugby came in the final on Thursday night to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji gave a master class in handling , side-Stepping , relegation , line runs and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-poor consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain 's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
The Boks ' clear defeat , 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
But regardless , Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form in this form .
It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fijis head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult road behind .
Eight years ago , they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide sevens .
Here , they lost only one .
This sleep will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks GBS out of fun .
The World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau rallied in the corner .
With still four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted .
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball .
A heaving run by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa reaching a third gate , but it only stopped Fiji .
In the seventh minute , Jasa Veremalua put a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new one since the rematch and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou pressured through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate .
The conversion brought a 29-0 lead to the break .
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learns .
That is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Fijian gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half , until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant midplay from Fiji .
Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB , made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 , but the game had long been in favor of South Texans , whose fans sang , waved flags and danced in the grandstand .
It was not hard to admire Fijis 's playful approach .
Mata Viliame set the i-goaltender with another try in the final seconds .
The Pfiff tweeted , the Fijis hugged themselves and GB kicked smashed in the lawn .
Earlier in the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 defeats and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Britain 's conversion of the difference .
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half .
A brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .

Russia and Turkey : an `` alliance of outsiders '' ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
Leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to give up their hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions .
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St Petersburg Palace , I can not deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
There was the handshake , yes .
But Putin 's smile acted narrowly , and he barely radiated warmth , even for his restrained conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his `` dear friend '' Putin - according to a report full five times .
I could not count it any more .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis levels , but will even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened .
To me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
But a sustainable coolness , broadcast by Putin , showed that Russia 's head of state had forgotten nothing .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the downing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was wrecked .
Putin split out and accused Ankara of having fallen behind Russia .
The offense was even greater as it was committed by an alleged friend .
Rebuilding the veto will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since Nov .
For months , state-controlled media conducted a fierce , full attack on Ankara .
At one time , it seemed the Turks were to blame for everything .
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan 's own family had benefited from the illegal trade in oil in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State .
He vehemently denied this .
But in St.Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , that meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan , which he wanted to hear .
Russia was a kind of victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire are clear .
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after being unveiled almost by his office last month in a failed coup .
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
The number has fallen by almost 90 % .
In Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume .
They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean .
This week , state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish farm imports are allowed again .
As a report in Vedemosti put it : `` tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response .
To this end , the ongoing resentment comes at the snail 's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey 's relationship with the West .
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup .
This is , of course , a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change .
The summit in this glamorous palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to depict , as an analyst once told me , the `` alliance of outsiders '' : two countries that feel wronged by the West and feel badly treated and are now allied .
However , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even jumped the issue .
Turkey 's president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize them .
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria .
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again .

The depressing food of the economic crisis in `` a rich meal ''
In March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
As a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like pâte de foie gras and Maryland water-turtle soup .
His menu on that day was slightly more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pepper and as dessert a plum pudding .
`` It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , '' said Jane Ziegelman .
Her husband Andrew CoE added , '' it was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . ''
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
CoE 's latest book , '' chop Suey , '' was about Chinese cuisine in the US , while Ziegelman was told about life in a home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective in her book `` 97 Orchard . ''
Her latest collaboration , '' a decent meal , '' which will appear in the Harper Verlag on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg 's Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small snack snack in the Flatiron District , which has been in store since the 1929 stock market crash .
Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive groves , while CoE , 57 , made turkeys with potato pepper and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten , this found the pair fit for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression .
`` Rich foods were very popular , '' Ziegelman said .
There was peanut broth , liver cheese and bean bread .
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners .
Coe grinned .
`` It must have been in the stomach like lead , '' he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet .
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastures for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War .
`` It was a time when food for the Americans became a central , tense issue , '' CoE begged , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
Equally tense was the new budget diet : mysterious dishes such as broth and casserolls became staple foods , the casserole as `` wonderful way to recycle food , '' noted Ziegelman , as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
Meat , which has been the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
Strange mixtures were tried , as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cuisine .
During her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with peanut butter .
`` It was not a popular addition at lunch , '' says Coe .
Ziegelmann continues : `` it was surreal . ''
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
It was typical for many of the house economic recipes .
As never before , or ever since , budget economists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - were so keen on the country 's eating habits .
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become `` budget politicians '' and meet the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
`` A Square Meal '' is a celebration of historical delicacies .
Especially tasty are the reports of the government 's response to the starving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoover 's Lass-mich-cake-eating attitude .
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen , he dined like the million-strong man of world to which he has become .
`` He liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce , '' said Coe .
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a Smoking .
He was wonderfully unrealistic .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to set an example with his stomach .
As described in the book , the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most dismal. ``
Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet .
The legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegelman , as well as how science was applied to food .
The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman 's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
`` She had a real fear of wasting food , '' said CoE .
Ziegelman recalled , '' she made people really sick . ''
There was the windbag incident .
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg , they and CoE drew a dessert that they had prepared at home : the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunchtime .
`` It is called prune whip , '' said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to miss modest recipes a send name .
There were no battered cream , just plums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Each appeared somewhat reluctant to have a spoon in the tough , brown glibber .
Amazingly , it was not bad .
CoE picked up an aftershock three times .
Like a Can-Do buddy , he said to his wife , '' A couple of chopped walnuts would help . ''

Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly : `` it is getting better ''
Like most 6-year-olds , Edmund Picciuto loves the singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
But like the least of his contemporaries , Edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy .
When he first came home , my first thought was , I do not get that .
I do not do that .
I did not get into it .
What is not right at all -- of course , you got into it , '' she said .
Her husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund may never recognize them , and that he may not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it .
`` My first response to this was ' I did not know that people still do , ' '' declared Picciuto .
Edmund can run with the help of a walker .
Edmund could not sit and crawl until his third year of life , and he still can not speak .
But he is making slow progress .
He can run with support and cycling .
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund for `` Please sing me something before `` . ``
`` We are bringing him sign language , '' Picciuto told CBS News .
But it is not a typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some characters on his own .
Microcephaly has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Edmund infections , as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy .
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus .
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked , what will happen ?
What will happen ?
And she still does not really know .
I have not been asking for the prognosis for a long time , because I do not expect them to really tell me anyone .
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus .
It is getting better .
You know it will be better for you .
You will love your child and your child will love you .

Nagold : game and fun at summer release
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and adolescents of the socio-educational day group/social group work of the child protection bishop Nagold with their carers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf , near Mühlacker .
In the quietly situated Freizeitheim Hardtramdle , the joyful group was hospitalized during the first school holiday week .
Several full-day trips were on the program .
On the one hand , it went to bail with the visit of the string zoo .
Second to Maulbronn , where there was a special children 's guide in the world-famous monastery .
The third excursion led to Pforzheim .
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Celts .
On the hot days , the group gathered at the deep lake in Maulbronn , which invited you to jump , swim and plan .
Culinary delights have been pampered by children and caregivers with their self-prepared corpses such as the Sauren Spittle , the Seebronner Pfanznle , Iselshauser-Bloff , English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese .
In workshops was baked , beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game .
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on fire and the final `` colorful evening '' .
On the day of the journey home , the sun and the children and young people were happy .

Escape : `` any fleeing woman has experience of sexual violence ''
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who flee on their own .
When they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatized .
A house offers refuge .
In a large kitchen , there are four women .
Each has a baby , which is no more than a year old .
One has put her little son in the arm .
He looks with big eyes curious in the room .
His mother stares at the table plate .
Until she realizes she is being watched .
She smiles short and kisses the little one .
The scene looks normal .
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr .
She is a division manager of Condrobs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with , among other things , women on the run .
The four women in the kitchen are fleeing .
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation for women and their children in Bavaria .
In January , Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women 's Aid .
It has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
Men do not exist - even as a visitor .
The exception is a guard at the door .
`` It is not an exaggeration to say that any woman who arrives here has made on her escape experiences with sexual violence , '' Bahr says .
`` Men are fleeing because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatening torture or death or because their families send them as hopefuls to Europe , '' she tells .
In women , there are other reasons for the escape : `` many are stealing from it because they see no other way out . ''
In their homeland , they have experience of sexual violence , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
That is what drives them .
On the run , that goes on .
`` That smugglers , for example , demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity , '' says Bahr .
And the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
Anyone who thinks that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is mistaken , tells Bahr .
Here , too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and , at worst , abused .
That means that about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized , she estimated .
`` Some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . ''
Many women are so used to saying nothing .
`` Or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big . ''
As they often do not know how to help , there is a need for more accommodation only for them , Bahr asks .
In Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees .
On the question of whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of responsibility , some answer no .
In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodation .
Even in Swabia , abandoned women are not being accommodated separately , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , press officer of the government .
In Oberbayern , Unter- und Mittelfranken , there are only for single women and their children in some dormitories or their own houses .
The exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
The European Parliament 's Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be separated from men .
In a study published for the committee , it said : `` it is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately . ''
`` Lacking the privacy , or getting men and women together , it can turn into - perpetual - violence against women . ''
In particular , the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , the study says .
The way in which women feel this need for protection can be seen at the arrival of the house in Munich .
`` Since it has been around , that there is us , we have a long waiting list , '' Bahr says .
You could easily set up a second house .

Traveler Ian Wright slams for a travel guide his tongue at Europe 's dirtiest places
A British traveller underwent his immune system and Würgereflex of a serious examination - leaving some of the dirtiest and most eclectic places in Europe .
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk shouted his course on a euro note , a railing at the Piccadilly Circus , a sprinkling of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system .
Before leaving each object , he used a luminometer to show up and show us what he is going to get into .
But the experiment , which was filmed under the title `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' brought some surprising results to light .
The idea of leaking the wrinkles of a train toilette , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely repulsive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
On his trip through Europe , Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
Fortunately , nothing left him , more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth .
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
From public purses at stations to spot-buttons of toilets , the task put his immune system definitively under a sample
In the film , he told reporters : `` as a child , I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film , he lived up to his reputation in any case .
The only thing he opposed was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
His trial stroke showed a luminous number of over 4000 units .
In comparison , the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their luminous number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' , which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom .
In the film , he says , '' that comes close to the worst I have got in a toilet . ''
There is nothing more dirty than that !
I am not going to spot anything here because it is ecclesiastical here .
`` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio .
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio 's freezer , which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Valios senior Venice president for snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics .
We led crazy brainstormings that ended that we said `` Let us call Ian . ''
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and , with the documentary , we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the movie shows we have a great sense of humour !
Tom HAKALA , who led the film 's directing , added : `` let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I have instructed him to lick , like the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film . ''
Of course there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult .
I am glad we have taken some of these dirty treats on film. ``
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio , 84 percent of all respondents surveyed milk-acid bacteria in particular , with the well-being of stomach and intestine , and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria .

Simone Biles creates gold in Damenturnen
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all that .
Dynamically on the jump horse .
Effortlessly on the beam .
Stunning on the ground .
Absolutely brilliant .
And now , at last , Olympic champion .
The 19-year-old American Turner drove to the multi-match title on Thursday and widened the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympics .
Their total score of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and `` final Five '' team adin Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina .
American women Simone Biles Turnt on the beam during the women 's singles tournament at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman to win a multiple-fight title and , overall , the fifth , while retaining her reputation for being the best of her generation , or even at all .
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment .
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years , winning 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou bailout of her said she is `` the best turner I have ever seen . ''
It was expecting a final test in Brazil , a contest that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations .
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be seen as a disappointment .
The Americans Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman hug themselves after they each won gold and silver in the women 's multiple-team tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal Tuesday while serving as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi .
Although Biles insisted , during her long road to the top , never planned the future , that is not really true .
Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
This is no coincidence .
This girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman 's mother during a school trip to the gym in which Boorman trained , became the force .
She has not lost multi-match competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning series that will continue as long as Biles wishes .
Even if Mustafina led by two turns slightly , the picture blew up .
Sweat beams and ground urns - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lauded .
She picked up again with 15.433 on the sweep bar - and put one on it with a 15.933 on the floor .
Raisman embraced them gently as they awaited their final gloss - a mere formality - and tears flowed on Biles gleefully red , white and blue Eyeliner , when the vision she once described in her collection book became the reality .
Raismans ' performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she struggled for third place , but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina .
This time , the 22-year-old team captain , called `` Grandma '' by the Americans , had a head start .
After her floor exercise , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful .
As for Biles , the fast-spreading tweet of 19-year-olds from earlier this week has a whole new meaning :

Police : 3 victims in serial murder case at music hearing in car shot
According to police reports released Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix 's first serial murder case while they were staying in the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis 's daughter Maleah were shot dead June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance , authorities said .
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while he was on the front passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , the report said .
Police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery , as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2.900 that was owned by one of the adult victims .
Phoenix Sgt . Jonathan Howard 's police spokesman said the shooting caused investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks .
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured , mostly in Hispanic residential areas within four months .
`` It is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , '' said Howard of the KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , earlier this month .
It is believed the suspect used several vehicles , including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
Investigators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis 's daughter Maleah still died on the spot .
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer .
Investigators found cartridges and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room .

Shoppers in Primark outrage over woman who tried shamelessly underwear amid business
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underhoses .
To aggravate the situation , she mustered how she looked , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf .
She stumbled further and tried four pairs of underhoses in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone .
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone where the woman tried the underdogs before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was in the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , '' she grabbed her again and left the store without buying anything . ''
She said : `` people could not believe what they saw . ''
Standing in the middle of the sales floor , she took a pair of underhoses out of the exposition , pulled her own tights and trousers and tried them .
`` She did not even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , cheeky like Oskar . ''
`` Everybody stared when she pulled out the underhoses that obviously did not like her as she put her back on the shelf . ''
She repeated the same thing with three other underdogs before she finally decided that she liked nothing , moved back and forth .
`` She did not seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underhoses she had tried . ''
Ms Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : `` how disgusting to think that someone would take shelter with someone who had a different person and who was not washed . ''
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added : `` as I have been told , the staff have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after it went - which is just as good . ''
`` I would hate to go home with a new pair of underhoses and find out that another woman had them and pulled out again and they did not wash . ''
A Primark spokesman said : `` Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 at our store in Folkstone . ''
All eligible products were pulled out of the sale .

De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July , many people were concerned about further attacks .
The state must respond calmly and decisively at the same time to terrorist threats .
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists .
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly , however , it would increase the security and strength of the people 's support for refugee policy .
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the federal election in 2017 .
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces , '' in mid-four-digit magnitude over several years . ''
Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
Video surveillance is to be improved , and gun law is being amended in such a way as to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet .
The last much-discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be respected , according to de Maizières .
However , he wants to seek solutions in the dialogue with the medical profession on how to reduce the vulnerability of citizens , he said , with a view , for example , to mental discoveries .
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees , the Minister believes that better social care is needed .
Teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people .
In order to prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Darknet ) de Maizière plans to use covert investigators .
SPD chief Gabriel said : `` the SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further enhance security . ''
It is important for the Home Secretary to speak out clearly against action .
`` That was a slap in the face for the sharpmakers in the CDU/CSU , '' Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group ( Friday ) .
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the union after a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
A general ban on full obfuscation is a constitutional problem .
You can not ban everything you are opposed to , and I reject the wearing of the burqa .
We can talk about rules such as road transport or witnesses in court .
Green leader Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate new anti-terrorist packages and capacity to act .
Left-wing party chief Bernd Riexinger said : `` fleet scraps and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring security to the people of this country . ''

Olympics : triple fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya 's athlete is in danger after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and current coach , John Anzrah , had made a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich .
This was reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controllers .
The World Association of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to appeal its own investigations , an IAAF spokesman said .
`` Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC , the IAAF will make an assessment , '' it said in an IAAF statement .
`` He ( Anzrah ) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich , the sample surrendered and signed , '' said Kenya 's chief of mission Stephan Arap SOI .
He was in possession of the athlete 's accreditation , which was on the list for training inspections of the World Anti-Doping Agency .
Ferguson Rotich was in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
Four days earlier , Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been stripped of the Rio Games .
He is alleged to have informed his country 's money payments athletes about upcoming doping tests .
Media reports said he was arrested on his return at Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping offences .
In announcing the more than 2000 doping target checks issued by the IOC before the Rio Games , it was unusually pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system .
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began .
As a result , WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in line with WADA rules .
Kenya is considered a major runner nation .
The country 's athletics won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
In a series of ARD television reports , there have been repeated accusations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had employed them in Russian athletics .
It has been demonstrated that there has been a systematic and systematic approach to this sport .
Russia 's athletics were subsequently ruled out of the Summer Games .

Cats react more sensitively than hangover to cries of young animals
Biologists have studied in Hanover what effect the rowing of cat babies has on adult animals .
To her surprise , the males did not leave the males cold , but they were always the same as the females .
Female cats can recognize the degree of excitement of cat babies at the mixing of the little ones .
They respond by 10 percent faster to sounds of kittens who choose in great distress , as scientists have found out from the animal medical college and the Medical University of Hanover ( MHH ) .
Hangovers also respond to the cries of kittens - but always the same .
`` Apparently , the acoustic differences between the inhibition of less and heavily drowned young animals for the males are either unperceivable or not of significance , '' said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH .
She is an author of the study , which was published this Friday in the trade magazine `` BMC evolutionary Biology . ''
In a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries differed with the urgency of their need for assistance .
A total of nine adult cadres and eight females were observed from the MHH animal husbandry .
They were played for three minutes from the sausage box and separated from the mother and siblings .
On the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens , which were raised in addition .
The researchers hold their findings despite the low sample for meaningful .
`` All females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , reacted differently to the cries , '' Konerding said .
They turned faster to the loudspeaker when that call played out of the much more drowning kittens .
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity .
`` A surprise was that the males reacted at all , '' the biologist said .
In the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noise on a number of occasions .
Also , some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , whether they were mothers or not , the biologist Marina Scheumann reported .

GfK leader resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GFK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann .
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprising .
The difficult situation of the market research firm GFK allowed the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann to be all the more insecure the longer the success he promised .
Turmoil at the head of the Nuremberg-based market research firm GFK : after once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company 's management , the world 's number five industry faces a human new start .
GfK 's board chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already out of the supervisory body with effect from 12 September .
The management on the Board of Directors already acquired the previous member of the Executive Board , Gerhard Hausruckinger , on 1 September .
He is to formally assume the role of a `` CEO '' until a successor is found for Hartmann .
As a reason for the resignations , the company called `` different views '' on the long-term business orientation .
Details did not want to call a company spokesman Friday .
Anyone who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear .
In investors ' circles , it was said on Friday that the disappointment of the further lack of success of the restructuring launched years ago had been great for shareholders .
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011 .
`` The fruits of the restructuring , however , are not yet visible after 5 years , '' it said .
Given the latest bad GfK business figures , each shareholder will eventually be restless .
`` If that were the case at BMW , that would also make the quandts like that , '' it said .
The company had also failed to halt its loss in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter .
At 361.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior-year quarter .
Related to the first half of the year , sales shrank by 3.4 percent to 721.2 million euros .
The gain in the second quarter mainly weighed on the company 's sunken value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
The company 's depreciation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business , gave the Group a loss of EUR 148.2 million .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GFK still generated a net profit of 19.7 million .

England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
For me , that represented the biggest attraction of Heathrow , just as it did in London at the time in 2012 , when we ran a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End .
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow .
For our local communities , we alone will create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage .
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcoming , but Heathrow answers every question put to him .
Like the Olympics , Heathrow is for many , not individual , an infrastructure project .
Enlargement is a way of creating up to 180,000 new jobs , £ 211bn of sustainable growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of the GB .
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £ 11bn expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T5 - which was chosen for five years in a row to the world 's best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built amid the world 's two most frequented runways .
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway , which is backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , thereby securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury

Illness : when the organiser pays
Sick holidaymakers will only receive money after their journey , if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel .
However , that is only the case when more than ten per cent of guests have been proven to show the same symptoms .
In the negotiated case , a family was badly affected by diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish leave .
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a faulty sewage plant , which allegedly polled the seawater .
The family believed the trip was flawed - and sounded against the organizer .
In court , the plaintiffs had no success .
It is true that the water treatment plant was broken .
But the organizer learned about it shortly before the departure of the plaintiffs .
He had to assume until then that the sea water was in order .
So he did not violate his information requirements , according to the ruling .
No contamination has been found in the samples of the water .
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly through contagion among themselves - is part of the general risk of life .
Out of 691 guests , only 38 were sickened .

Pokémon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been lamented by many over the last decade .
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active .
The time on screen was initially confined to the TV , then to video games and , most recently , to smartphones .
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I am referring , of course , to the Pokémon Go-Wahn , an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , interest decreased before the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
The market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded .
Within a few days , Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , players with their smartphones go out and look for Pokémons , which is tracked with a GPS and , once found , can be `` photographed '' ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or `` captured '' .
A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped for the search from the sofa .
In the US , the game led to a significant increase in steps that put the `` average '' person back every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game 's launch , the number of folks who train for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to improve performance .
Many public health education campaigns that want to get people to `` take 30 minutes of time to come '' `` from the sofa '' and `` to be active every day '' came on deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look elder .
However , the importance of sport can not be overstated .
Whoever drives sports regularly reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
Physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
Thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people even find new friendships on the hunt .
As always , there are also mammoth gamblers who always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could run against a door .
What is to be done ?
There has been a breakthrough .
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does .
The new will lose its charm and the use will ease with time .
However , because of Pokemon 's success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is manageable .
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variation on the beach with some colleagues .
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old .
CHIO : `` golden sports pyramid '' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hunted in the fast gallop home to the fodder troughs .
One kilometer at this pace , I was scared .
`` It was not a good experience , '' Langer says .
And so the riding career ended up again .
On Saturday , Germany 's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
He left with his family over the plant of the ALRV , on a horse he did not even bother for photo purposes .
Langer was the first time in Aachen and also with the CHIO .
The reason was quite convincing .
The German sports aid was given to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid .
At awards , the likeable athlete is not lacking .
Federal Cross of Merit , Silver 's laurel , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
Even the British Queen has already adored him .
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
In Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday .
`` This award means a lot to me , '' says Langer , '' because it is awarded not only for sporting successes , but also for social engagement . ''
For decades , Langer has been promoting the young .
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
With 15 other outstanding athletes , the two-time U.S. Masters champion was inducted into the `` Hall of Fame of German Sports '' on Saturday .
The performances include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt , the Turner Eberhard Gienger , the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch , Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt , the rowers Peter-Michael Kolbe , the Judoka Frank Wieneke , the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich .
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
After the official part , the illustrious society wandered into the Springstadion , where the Lavazza Prize was running .
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals .

NASA climate model : Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have taken up similar conditions with its hot , waterless surface and carbon-dense atmosphere .
Scientists have previously hinted that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin , earthquake-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus .
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect it from rapid evaporation .
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
`` In the GISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day side of the sun for almost two months , '' explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release .
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat .
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of Earth today .
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously suspected of planetary researchers .
Although it was probably habitable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years .
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away by the ultraviolet light .
As their Hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters .

U.S. win fourth match in women 's field hockey , showdown with Britain
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women 's American field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the Americans won by 3-0 .
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but Bam ( 27 ) said she could not remember having ever done that .
`` I have no idea . '' she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
However , she knows that : the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place , who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet Saturday in the last game of the first round .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals , the game will decide which of the two within their group from six teams will each gain the first and second place .
The first place will go a little longer for the strong Dutch , who will lead the other group .
Whatever the game on Saturday , the American women have sparked a surprising upset by their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the past London Games .
BAM was part of this team .
She grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey sleeper in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University ) , with 16 years she became national playwright , the youngest in the team 's history .
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she failed to qualify for the caddie .
Then came 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
The following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , coach of the national team , began to turn things around for the better .
`` A culture change , a mental change and a physical change , '' Bam said .
We did not have the workload in London that we have now .
We have been able to take the helm completely .
On Thursday night , Bam opened the torch in the first half of the game with a rebound from close range .
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 down into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands .
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved to the middle and lubricated the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the final quarter .
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper , Jackie Briggs , who has so far had to concede a gate in each of the previous games .
She has a run .
Same as Bam .
`` We are in a good position , '' said Parnham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .

Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Levan Dzhagaryan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year .
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest on the part of Russian companies in shops in the country has grown sharply , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking on existing links with Iran , while new firms are willing to gain access to the market .
Of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , '' said Dzhagaryan .
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of the year 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 , and was $ 856 million .
In particular , Russian imports into Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and totaled $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
The trade recovery has been achieved by supplies of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , '' said the ambassador .
Dzhagaryan is out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
Last year , Russian expatriate representatives issued some 35,000 visas , primarily travel visas , to Iranian citizens .
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year , will be broken , '' he said .
At the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
`` I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd , which have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , '' he said .

Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax return for 2015 on Friday , delivering an income of $ 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 % for the Democrats ' presidential candidacy and her husband .
In 2015 , the Clintons donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $ 5.3 million in Redehonorars ; the former secretary of state gave an income of $ 3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department .
Clinton 's candidate for the vice presidency , Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia , along with his wife Anne Holton , published his tax returns of the past decade .
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
`` Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , '' gave Clinton 's campaign hero Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion .
In a stark contrast , Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backers on his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
`` They are on the train , '' Clinton campaign aide Ian SAMS wrote on Twitter , referring to the release of the Democrats ' presidential candidacy .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump 's special adviser , told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are not completed .
Trump 's critics , including the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , have already said that his refusal raises questions about wealth , his donations to charitable organizations , his business practices , and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already cracked down on the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-profile Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax return .
On Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
`` He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns , '' she said to the crowd .
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s for two years , and a New York Times economics journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday , saying that could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a settlement named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett , who would ensure that people earning more than $ 1 million pay a tax cut of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska called for Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has his seat here , to exchange Trump for a meeting on their tax returns .
Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the IRS and Trump was `` afraid '' of the voters , not the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has scaled back tax returns until 2007 .
The Clintons , who now live in Chappaqua , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
Clinton 's 2015 tax return showed that those only paid $ 100 of their income as a wage , unlike the bulk of all Americans .
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund , from which Clinton 's dividends and earnings of $ 109,000 were taxed .

Mahaj Brown , 6 , '' riddled with bullets , '' survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is being shot .
The boy 's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown .
The grandparents said Brown suffered several stab injuries , including in the lender , leg , arm and belly , but that he was hospitalized when he was transported to the hospital .
`` He has gone through a lot , his little body was riddled with bullets , '' shared his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station .
I simply can not believe that .
The boy 's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries .
The boy 's family told the station that he is expected to recover .
He should have started the first class at a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people shot at Germantown .
Also shot down were three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old .
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition , according to CBS Philadelphia .
The boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old , who is in a critical condition , the station reported .
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the injured men .
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be a crossfire between several shooters .
Cartridges for storm guns , traced to various storm guns , overturned the scene .
It seems that this has clearly been an ongoing struggle .
On the street , on both sides of the trail , there were hugs .
So there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved , '' shared police chief Anthony Ginaldi of police in Philadelphia told the station .
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
No arrests have been made and police are currently reportedly reviewing the surveillance video .
On Tuesday , another 6-year-old girl was hit by a transcript at the arm when she played in front of her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect .

Podolski attacks ' gala ' after Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey .
In Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
For the first time after the attempted coup , a major football match is taking place in Turkey .
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski 's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : `` business as usual '' .
Even when the state of emergency was declared after the attempted coup in July , the government insisted that the daily lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected .
This does not , however , apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is responsible for the attempted coup .
This does not stop before football .
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against former strongman Hakan Sükür .
Thus , the South American now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
South Africa is said to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
It is true that the state of emergency imposed for 90 days is still in force until October , but in fact it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks .
The nightly `` democracy guards '' in public places across the country , Erdogan said Wednesday .
Sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan .
Especially fans of the workers ' club Besiktas are traditionally not among the president 's friends .
What unites the majority of Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military coups .
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas .
At Pokalwinner `` Gala '' it will come back to Lukas Podolski again .
The Kölner in the past season proved his athletic value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club .
In the final game against Fenerbahce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
The newspaper `` Fanatik '' cheered him : `` he was the best in the place . ''
He finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the Cup .
Thanks to `` Poldi , '' the disappointing season for the record champion was a conciliatory finish .
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League , the `` lions '' also dropped out in the Europa League early on .
In the South Lig , it was only to rank six .
The season was not good .
The Cup was the only way to win something .
`` That is what we did and that is the most important thing , '' said Podolski .
For Masters Besiktas , the game year ran better .
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez , who , with 26 seasons as a South Florida goalkeeper , put the base to the 14th title .
That is also the reason fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old 's return .
In the case of the AC Florence under contract and Besiktas only borrowed Gomez after the attempted coup , he announced that he had failed to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
`` If Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , '' said the trade magazine `` Kicker '' club chief Fikret Orman .
To do this , however , the Stürmer would have to be prepared to renounce about a third of his annual salute estimated at 7.5 million euros , Orman said , adding : `` his salary at Florence we can not pay . ''

28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center .
The victim 's brother said he can not imagine anyone who would want to harm him , '' Finally , it went uphill again at him . ''
The corpse , found Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall , was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco , the Justice Department said in San Francisco .
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is on the running .
The victim 's brother , Louis Galicia , told the ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank , who formerly worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were `` shocked and destroyed on the ground '' over his death .
`` We are a small team that works like a close family and we are going to miss him painfully , '' said the spokesman .
Our thoughts and condolences are in this difficult time at Franks 's family and friends .
Louis Galicia admitted that Frank initially lived in hostels , but that `` things for him finally went uphill . ''
`` He found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , '' shared Louis Garcia KGO .
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother .
He was a friendly person with a big heart .
His way to connect with his family was to always give us something to cook , prepare us dinner , '' said Louis Galicia .
He never wanted to take part in any kind of controversy .
He was the brother who swam with the electricity .
`` In everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this unvarnished diamond that brightened bright every day , '' he said .
Anyone with information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD 's execution phone under the number 415-575-4444 .

French court rejects bid over demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to crack down dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungles of Calais , where thousands of refugees live .
At a court hearing this week , authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to tear down 72 provisional stores where people inside the camp are selling goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks , offering hairdressers , or selling tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants .
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that pose a fire and sanity risk .
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
They also said that the makeshift shops and restaurants would often provide shelter and free meals for people in need .
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional shops , but admitted that the concerns of Calais prefecture were `` absolutely understandable . ''
The judge Jean-François Molla said the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who `` live in extremely precarious conditions . ''
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids ' Café of the camp , which is commonly operated , and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors in the camp .
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the kids ' cafe .
In a letter to the Guardian , it said the closure would be `` a disaster for these children , the youngest of whom is eight years old . ''
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L ' Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9000 people - the highest number so far - after a sharp rise in newcomers over the summer .

Data clamp : so perfidious blacker hackers get their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful .
According to a recent survey of malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America , Britain and Germany , 40 percent of companies surveyed over the past 12 months have been at least once , in part , victims of an attack with blackmailer software .
In Germany , nearly 20 percent of firms were already targets of a ransomware blackout .
40 % of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the systems and data that were attacked .
According to the observations of Malwarebytes , the perpetrators are specializing in attacks in corporate networks .
If they are successful there , the potentially blackened ransom is significantly higher than for private users .
`` We are currently watching a frighteningly rapid evolution of the malware , '' explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in talks with the `` world '' .
In 2008 , most malware programs were designed to send advertising .
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves .
Only private users were the target , but the switch to company attacks has been terribly fast over the last few months .
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim 's computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals in a sustainable way .
Then the software presents the demands of the blackmailers .
In order to get the end keys code to the files , the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin .
However , where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is closed .
As a result , the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes .
22 % of the affected German firms reported revenue losses by Ransomware , 13 % had to disrupt business altogether ; in one case , people were in danger of life .
In Germany , hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records .
`` We always tell the victims : do not pay , it only encourages the problem , '' explains Kleczynski .
But 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay are getting their data back .
It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators ' demand in the face of a standstill in operation .
The hackers , in turn , know this and are trying everything to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , F-Secure security researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to take more money .
They declare their victims by chat , how they can pay by Bitcoin , set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files .
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted .
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackouts , the hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work , explains security expert Chester WISNIEWSKI of the antivirus provider Sophos : `` a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week . ''
However , it is more likely that there are three or four people .
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual blackmailers .
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
`` Included in the scope of delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and branding can be changed , '' says WISNIEWSKI .
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
So you log into one of the forums underground , buys the set of a criminal and instructs you to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
Payment is made per infected computer .
`` Usually the criminals charge spammers with the spread , '' explains WISNIEWSKI .
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data .
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on the ability to repel Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software .
Accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
`` If the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful performance , the perpetrators are threatening instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , '' explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski .
As a result , the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
It would also be possible for the perpetrators to take completely new targets on the Internet in the future .
At the hacker conference Defcon , security researchers showed how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control .
In the middle of winter , the release of such blocked heating could well be worth a ransom .
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0 .

Old buildings , some Lindenbäumchen , interspersed with the rest of the cobblestones : the Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight , but the police are one of the `` dangerous places '' of the city .
Walk down the road from east to west , passing on playgrounds , a freshly coated kindergarten and a biolad .
To the facade of a grey house someone has sprayed `` ugly ! ''
Compared to a Lidl , which is soon to be demolished , it is already being built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created .
Articles about this `` trendy district '' , as the real estate company Friedrichshain called it , are , however , preferred in recent weeks with burning cars .
The reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and are used for events .
Especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had argued several times since the beginning of the year for tough police action against the project , describing the area as a `` no-go zone '' for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
After being cleared on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the cadtery crews , with 300 police officers , patrolled the police for three weeks , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground , blocked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
Meanwhile , construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown homeowners .
On July 13 , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers withdrew amid the jubilation of sympathizers and residents .
On this summer afternoon , the road is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun , others entertain Späti .
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens .
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in the Kiez since 1999 , and Jana * , who has three children here , are mainly generated by the police presence .
With residents of the home projects , they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification .
It does not sound like a Kiez , who mostly wanted police protection against vandalising leftists .
The ditch of the Berlin interior senator and the police between house occupants and their neighbours does not seem to exist .
Friedrichshain , in the east of Berlin , was actually a traditional working-class district , which today also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city .
Home occupation and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the Kiez : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all of Mainz Street near the rig .
While the Mainzer had been cleared under great police escort in a veritable street battle , many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago .
At the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and polling liners from all over the world .
That is also evident in the rents , which have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 in new rentals .
Many of the new constructions in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on wrapped slices or freshly coated facades that have been tossed with color bags .
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words `` left-wing violence '' .
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against police officers .
Most of the crimes are causing material damage , which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of insecurity .
As far as violence is concerned , it is appeasement : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , who are certainly not .
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in the Rigaer .
For the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : `` here you help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere '' .
Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer street - and stayed .
That is why it was so important for the residents to get their street back : the police , the politics and the media , all of whom suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district in July .
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer , the road continues to be taken away : by faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that crowd out the old inhabitants .
`` These are , after all , condominiums that are not interesting to many here - they are more likely to be people who are not so good , '' she says .
`` I absolutely do not approve of violence and destruction . ''
But what should you do if someone never listens ?
There is frustration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Kerstin Neugebauer , who is annoyed by color bombs , has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez .
Anyone who moves should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a pub district can complain about noise there .
All of the people presented with first names asked not to be named with their proper name

Jewish director crushed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after ' Arab ' call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media revolt after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-selection as it asked Arab guests , according to an employee. ``
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentary `` Shoah '' , left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ .
During his last stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel 's country selection list .
The country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
Wrote Lanzmann .
Instead , the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center .
After a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The answer he received there , '' shocked him , '' Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel employee said the measure was a `` deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels . ''
The reason behind it sparked even more fury in the director .
`` The bulk of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted , '' Lanzmann 's employee was quoted as saying .
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a `` great shame , '' the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported .
We were appalled and dismayed by this event .
This is really very shameful .
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more shameful .
That does not require any explanation .
We expect the hotel `` to draw the right conclusions , '' said the official .
The incident caused quite a lot of resonance on the Internet , in which people called the whole thing a scandal .
Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it had `` succumbed to the alleged calls of Arab guests . ''
`` Shame on you , '' it said in another post , noting that the hotel , located at the noble Kurfürstendamm , is near a synagogue .
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations of itself and called the incident an `` oversight '' and `` apologized '' at Lanzmann , Der Spiegel reported .
`` There has never been a direct statement `` not to include Israel in the Quick List , '' quoting the Süddeutsche Zeitung a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel .
It adds that the country selection has now been added .

Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunts proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it .
In July , Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract forced and said the NHS would be in a `` no-man 's land '' and any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients .
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care at uncomfortable times .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the BMA 's chairman for assistant physicians told a news conference last night : `` assistant physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly . ''
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors are under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out .
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks resonated with the government 's reluctance to take part , and sometimes to deafening silence .
That was the one promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open .
`` Jeremy Hunt needs to act now , lift the imposition and address the concerns of assistant doctors . ''
If he fails to do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further industrial action .
The latest strike in late April saw an upswing of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules , as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to provide cover to doctors on the strike mail chain .
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
The BMA wants a better weekend reward for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , director-general of the NHS staff , urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike .
Mortimer said : `` labor action measures do not achieve anything of the little , but already strain teams and service providers and prepare the patients , carers and their families only for concern , distress and disruption . ''
Over the last two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns about the guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries .
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how seriously employers , the Health Education England and the Department of Health were about to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November , February and May .

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
So , in competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg , the city of Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and firms relocating from London .
`` It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote , '' says Michael Voigtländer , head of the IW 's financial markets and real estate markets .
After the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to run from London to financial transactions across the EU .
For the so-called EU passport , they have been granted authorisation in the United Kingdom .
That is what large US banks are using .
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs .
The lobbying association `` Frankfurt Main Finance '' anticipates 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
For Frankfurt , IW , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the eurozone 's largest banks , as well as other key authorities such as the European insurance supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB risk council .
In Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial industry than the ECB .
`` Proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with oversight , '' says IMF professor Voigtländer .
Luxembourg is a large fund industry , but , like Dublin , it is worse off in terms of infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
Furthermore , the city with easily available commercial real estate .
`` In Paris , it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices , '' says Voigtländer .
At the Seine , rents for first-class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
In addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
In a ranking of business consultancy Mercer , the city stands at No . seven , Luxembourg at No . 19 , Dublin at No . 33 and Paris in 37th place .
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences : `` with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , '' the IW concludes .
But , despite Brexit 's vote , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , economic researchers say .
This is also true of the balance of power : in London , according to the figures of Landesbank Helaba , around 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 ; in Frankfurt it was 62500 .

Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands punitive interest rates from wealthy savers - as the second institute in Germany .
Bank chief Josef Paul said Thursday : `` it is only about 139 customers who parked 40 million euros on giro or daytime bank accounts . ''
The German Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : normal savers would have to `` not worry about paying for their Spartan penalty . ''
Camp banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate .
As of September , Raiffeisenbank Gmund will require private and corporate customers to spend more than 100,000 euros on giro or daily money accounts .
`` The first 100,000 euros are free . ''
`` The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year , '' Paul said .
He has been hitting EUR 40 million for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not use .
`` Those are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , '' the bank chief said .
`` I can not lay down for every million 4000 euros . ''
In accordance with the ' polluter pays ' principle , the cost is now continuing .
Leaving the cash simply in the Raiffeisenbank 's coffers would be far too dangerous : `` I have already experienced four assaults , I do not want to be the fifth ! '' said the bank board .
Most customers would have understood and switched to other forms of investment .
Only a few migrated to other banks .
The Bavarian Cooperative Association said : `` the ECB 's extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs at all banks . ''
To wear it on its own is ' not possible in the long term ' .
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
With punitive interest rates for deposits from three million euros , the Thuringian People and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kemmer , chief executive of the banking association , said : `` we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong . ''
One banker said that at Tegernsee , there is `` a clientele that is somewhat more exuberant from the assets . ''
`` That can become a problem for a small bank '' if it hires free money .
The cooperative bank Gmund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach-Egern , Kreuth and Tegernsee .
Well-known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
The Bavarian Confederation `` is currently not known to any other banks that charge an outlay for deposits from private customers , '' said spokesman Ernst .
The President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken ( BVR ) , Uwe fröhlich , declared at the end of June : `` the threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very , very high '' .
The competition is tough , and it drops the drain on investors .
Customers in Germany will not like it in width .

Donald Trump admits ″ huge problems ″ in election campaign
The US Republican leadership is plagued by massive worries about losing its majority even in traditionally conservative states .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah .
A rare moment in which the multi-millionaire and self-reliant multimillionaire said something like concerns , correspondents reported .
After throwing 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race , doubts are now growing about his success in the battle for the White House .
`` We have huge problems in Utah , '' said Trump before evangelical Christians he asked for support in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
Blaming false reports about his candidacy , he again picked up his familiar media credentials .
Republican strongholds wraps up
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans .
According to a SurveyUSA survey in June , Trump and his rival , Hillary Clinton , were on an equal footing .
Other institutions see Trump ahead , but not by the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk .
In an interview broadcast by Sen. CNBC , Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton 's march again : `` just as I have done so far . ''
And afterwards : this will be `` either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday '' .
He is doing nothing other than `` telling the truth . ''
If it was not rich for him in the end , for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Trump said .
Then I return to a very good way of life .
According to press reports , Trump 's party should have threatened to withdraw funds to support his campaign , should he not be able to present better poll numbers .
Instead , the Republican Party 's candidates for Congress should be given more support .

31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water association `` Veitensteingruppe '' , Ruppert Göller , is retiring .
The association is regarded as a `` Bavarian model '' .
A small Franconian drinking water association as a role model for the big water producers .
That is how it was said some time ago in the original tone in a post by the Bavarian radio .
Little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia paid tribute to the association .
The work of the Veitensteingruppe yellow `` bayernfar as exemplary '' .
Behind all this is Rupert Göller , who has been a member of staff for 31 years , 28 years as managing director .
He was now retired at the age of 65 .
The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe , based in Kottendorf , municipality of Breitbrunn , promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants .
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter , Breitbrunn , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach .
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
The current chairman , Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert Göller was recruited as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Purpose Federation in 1988 .
`` His duties have been very diverse and they ranged from water management and maintenance work to office and organizational activities , budgeting , calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends , '' the chairwoman said .
As outstanding events it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land acquisitions in the area of new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the rehabilitation of the reservoirs ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
There has been no standstill , and there have been repeated innovations because water is living and drinking water is the most important food .
In her Laudatio , she praised Göller 's faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
He has worked with a great deal of heart for his water purifier , and he has lived up to the water purifier as if it were his own company .
A few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was able to present the concept of success of the Veitensteingruppe to reduce nitrate before the Water Forum of the District of Lower Franconia .
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this .
Rupert Göller , for his part , praised water wart Alfons Griebel , who worked with him for 28 years .
He is the best water goalkeeper and he was a faithful crisp .
Together we were an unbeatable team .
As highlights from his point of view , he described the Brunnenbau and the restructuring of the purpose association .
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , was the piping on the high container at Kirchlauter on a 3 January .
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
It was also possible to maintain the supply of Neubrunn , because it was filled with hoses .
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter , who is the successor of Rupert Göller .

Reid says Clinton will remain in the case of an election victory at Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democratic presidential nominee , Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court .
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland 's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March .
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge at the Antonin Scalia Supreme Court .
Reid said Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland `` with some degree of certainty . ''
A Reid spokeswoman later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated .
He praised Garland and said Clinton 's team would not provide for unrest with a new candidate .
Garland is the top judge for the U.S. appeals court for the District of Columbia .
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garland nomination , were lackeys and aides of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
He also noted that Donald Trump was unfit for the presidency .

Killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others : Khaled Omar .
He was the hero of Aleppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
He risked everything to save others ' lives .
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a Fassbomb attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the White Helmets , a civil protection group that , according to the Bild newspaper , has saved nearly 60 000 lives so far .
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone .
They are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Guard showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
It made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of war .
As a hero , however , he never saw himself , saying , according to the picture , '' for me , that is the real jihad . ''
`` If I am dying to save lives , I think God sees in me a martyr . ''
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the latest bombing in Syria .
Helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
A woman and two children died , seven people were suffering from breathing .
`` We are now eliminating the poisonous remains of the bomb , lest children play with it , '' the Bild quoted his last words before he died .
The Assad regime 's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists .

One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans .
Sounds pretty overloaded , but the HR-V , constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , turns out to be very flexible in everyday life .
Although only 1.60 m high HR-V looks small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work at any point .
The materials of the interior are well processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit upper side is there .
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
There is not only a trunk of 453 litres at high and 1026 litres , but there are the `` Magic Seats '' .
This is less magical than it sounds : the rear seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinemas and thus offer storage space , which is 1.24 metres high from the floor to the ceiling .
The trunk can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 horsepower accelerates the HR V thanks to torque of up to 300 nm in wide speed ranges .
However , he is likely to do his job somewhat quieter .
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing .
There is another motorization : a 1.5-lb petrol tank with 96 kW/130 horsepower .
An all-wheel drive is not offered .
Driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamism and comfort .
But steering is likely to be a little more direct .
The equipment in the tested top variant `` Executive '' leaves nothing to be desired .
The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the gauge assistant .
The collision warner sometimes irritates , because he evaluates many obstacles as `` approaching objects '' .
The remote light assistant works very reliably .
And the intelligent temporegler responds to the traffic sign detection and drops speed when needed .
The full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7-inch touchscreen , Navi , app integration and more .
Two USB and one HDMI connectors are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach .
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order .
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros , the diesel from 23000 euros .
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard .
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .

Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was `` sarcasm ''
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign , saying that his oft-repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the `` founders '' of the terrorist group Islamic State was not serious .
That clarification raised new questions about the communications skills of the Republican presidential nominee , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public .
It also brings his comrades , who seek to protect him during an eventful phase , into the peculiar position of having to explain statements he might not have meant at all .
After making the suggestion at a campaign event Wednesday night , Mr. Trump rested on the claim Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
But in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic .
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day , when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation was entirely serious .
When conservative radio writer Hugh Hewitt sought to help Mr. Trump to soften the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential nominee did not want to know anything about it .
The last storm of criticism cracked down on Mr. Trump , while trying to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling poll numbers on the economic situation .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again .
Speaking on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has already raised sarcasm to his defense .
At the end of July , he drew strong criticism when he suggested that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but he later declared , '' Of course , I meant the sarcastic . ''
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back down as needed .
`` I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then , if necessary , '' clarify `` depending on how the reaction is out , '' said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates .
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
Instead of defying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone , as his poll ratings have continued to decline .
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist , released Friday , showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida .
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks , he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humor .
But , while he has been the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's joke has put his loyal fellow Democrats in the uncomfortable position of having to stand up to him , no matter how provocative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , former mayor of New York and one of Trump 's most prominent advocacy groups , made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday .
`` I think what he is saying are legitimate , political comments , '' said Mr. Giuliani , adding he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump 's statements on whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
It is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them backbenchers , completely wrong , and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , it allowed ISIS to spread out by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East .
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of spying on each of his words and being biased against him .
He scorned the `` poor , jolly '' TV experts who try to understand him and said , '' you can 't ! ''
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump 's apology as just one more proof that he was unfit for the presidency .

Haigerloch : pilgrims to the gates of mercy
The ministrants from the peace group Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the move on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg .
Together , four stages have been dealt with .
In order to bridge the period up to the next romantic ride of all mini transmitters in probably two years , the Saint-Anna Oberministrantenround has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage .
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and it was decided finally for the bishop 's town of Freiburg , where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy with the open gates of mercy at the Freiburger Münster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Minis from Bittelbronn , Gruol , Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern were on the way .
Earlier in the evening , Pfarrer Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and gave the pilgrims .
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen , where there was also a Munster of Our Lady , and so the pilgrimage was taken by the Münster .
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and lyrics .
On the other hand , the minis at field crossings , chapels or churches were also on the way to sing together a song from Pilger-Liedheft .
For the overnight stays , parish heaters of the local parishes were available .
At the milestones , Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast .
It went on for the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach .
The day after St. Peter , which was the most strenuous stretch of road , had to first descend at around 500 meters of altitude and then come back again .
The deserved reward was in the evenings a common barbecue on the beach .
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
Visibly relieved and happy , the Minis met in the later afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and went through the gates of mercy .
With a little impulse , God was thanked here .
At the evening fair in the Münster , the mini was greeted by collaborator Markus Obert on the pilgrimage .
After the service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar .
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis .
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train .
In the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .

Culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former mayor of Tower hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored , as a damning government report revealed today .
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally blames police , election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to `` over-sensitivities regarding Ethnie and Religion . ''
The former minister of integration and municipal government , who is now an anti-corruption royal , said intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up roadblocks outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters .
He recommends that voters should have an identity card to prove their identity in elections .
At the moment , a voter only has to name his name and address .
The report suggests not wearing removable ink on a person 's finger when they cast their ballot to prevent someone from voting twice .
Whistleblower should get more protection , says Sir Eric
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups .
`` That is not just against electoral fraud , but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it , '' he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower hamlets campaign scandal in east London .
Last year , a special election court ruled that incumbent Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
The court found that Rahman had `` cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community '' and that he had silenced his critics with racissism and Islamophobia .
Rahman is said to have `` led his campaign on the basis that it is the religous duty of Muslims to choose him . ''
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation in which one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
In particular , he expressed an alarm at the fraudulent election - where the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including driving out identity cards to prove identity
His report says : `` as evidence , it was appropriate to put pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , to vote according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds .
`` There were concerns that ... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour because of '' politically correct `` over-sensitivities regarding Ethnie and Religion . ''
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations had been made to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists are editing letter papers to stop `` polling . ''
The report , which is being considered by Theresa May , also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
Consider options to ask voters before the election , according to your ID .
Do not use removable ink on a person 's finger once she has cast her vote to prevent someone from voting twice .
To carry out systematic checks on a person 's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
A three-year limit on applications for automatic mail votes .
Ban that political activists process full postal elections and envelopes of letter elections .
The police give the authority to set up closures around polling stations .
A change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 ( People 's Rights Act 1983 ) .
Photography ban in polling stations .
Requirement that only English should be used in polling stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
Intensification of training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booths alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it `` amazing '' that after the Tower hamlets case no criminal complaint was made .
`` The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unfit for purpose because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , '' he said .
He was found guilty on a number of grounds for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
He also criticizes the ineffective `` quake controls '' of the city halls ' election registration departments .
Sir Eric said : `` the court ruling in Tower hamlets last year was a warning sign .
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .

Woman killed in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night .
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was ousted in the early hours of Thursday amid a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight .
A woman took to the streets in the Dark `` in an act of desperation '' and was hit by several cars , police said in Vaud .
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49 , who was overrun by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
She still died on the ground .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , who asked these as well as any witnesses of the incident to sign up .
An investigation has been opened , which is a `` logical '' step in such a situation , Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be shown .
Was a collision preventable ?
That is something the prosecutor has to decide , '' said Hofstetter .
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable .
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway , the newspaper said .
Last year , a policewoman accused of negligent killing was acquitted after she overran and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014 .
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had become unconscious on the street , the court heard .
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a `` completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation , '' the judge said .
Anyone who has any further information on the incident Thursday near Morges should contact police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .

North Sea oil workers resume talks , set off strike
Labor disputes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all the contenders are set for a new round of talks , negotiators said .
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been conducted sporadically on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
`` Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the settlement process of the current dispute , '' it said in a joint statement .
We will hold some full-day sessions in the next few weeks , which will start early next year to address the issues .
The unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group this year cut rates to its contractor in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
The company 's rate cut follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014 .
The company said additional cuts would give the company the space needed to come through the market downturn .
Shell has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it rationalises its activities as a result of its mega-mergers with the British energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was heightened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with Labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation .
The North Sea is important to the regional economy , he said .
`` In the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , '' he said in a statement .
2016 is expected to be less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .

Heavy rain , flooding give rise to rescue in Louisiana , Mississippi
Heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday , with more rain expected throughout Saturday .
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains , the National Weather Service reported .
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to help affected communities .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the governor 's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , said that requests for flood vehicles , boats and sandbags were multiplying .
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested tens of thousands of sandbags .
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisiana until Saturday .
The weather service indicated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
A tsunami warning system was set up in the south of Alabamas on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
The River Comite near baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs , both of which are located in Louisiana , are all likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
The metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes into the suburbs near baton Rouge .
He also said that a stroke-down exuberance in Ascension Parish poses a danger , as these are going to flow slowly into Lake Maurepas across the river .
The Tickfaw River , south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.00 on Friday .
Rescue teams still trapped people from the floodwaters in the Amite district and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and stepson were among those rescued Friday near Gloster .
Hansford , 62 , says water from Beaver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his home , rose sharply overnight .
He said another stepson , who lives nearby , had been warned .
`` We woke up and the water flowed and poured in , '' said Hansford .
It reached my waist .
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years in which she lived there , she had never seen such a high tide of the river .
Hansford said he and his family members all had disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hansford said that Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the nearest fire station in Gloster , where they were staying until Friday .
Krautmann said the flooding had `` spread quickly '' as there continued to be heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation orders .
According to Krautmann , an observer arrived near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain .
Krautmann said the ground had been considerably swollen by the rains since Wednesday .
Authorities said heavy rains and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and tuition failure in five school districts .
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a subordinate in Tangipahoa gave up 200 flooded homes .
Residents were evacuated in two churches , which were now both flooded .
The suburb of the municipality of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that were strapped from the floods .
In the cities of Amite and Hammond , emergency shelters were set up to house the evacuees .
`` Once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , '' he said .
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa , nearly two dozens of roads were closed due to the flooding and provided sandbags to residents who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
`` The last major flooding we had was in March , '' said Lacy Landrum of the city government .
This seems to be a similar incident .
In Mississipp , emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
According to his figures , a handful of homes were to have been reported flooded Thursday , but none were reported on Friday .
Keith Townson , manager at shopper Value Foods in Amite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
`` I have seen water in places I have never seen before , '' said Townson , '' and it is still coming . ''

Police deploy tear gas & rubber floors against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government 's reforms for the public education system .
Police set up tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
The trouble began when police officers tried to disperse the students , causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas .
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans .
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , slightly fewer than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money .
Some of the protest participants saw graffiti against interim President Michel Temer sprayed on walls .
The latest protests occurred a few days after demonstrators in crowds took to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff , who had been removed from office by a Senate vote on her dismissal .

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and `` title defender '' Zhang Jike 4 : 0 ( 12.5.4.4 ) on Thursday in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro .
That brings the world ranking first to the Golden Grand Slam with success at WM , World Cup , World Tour Finals tournament and Olympia .
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani .
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made up the title with each other .
It was clear that for the third time in succession a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the five rings .
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic staircase was former SVS-NÖ-legionnaire Ryu Seung-min of South Korea .
Ma and Zhang were left alone at the plate , between the sentences and on time-outs they had no coaches at all .
Those had retired to the gallery and left their butts in fair competition on their own .
`` The matches so far I have played for my country . ''
`` In the final I am playing for me , '' Zhang said folly .
After the match , gold and silver medal winners with the China flag .
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided .
Ma had really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set .
After that , he set the pace at the plate and left Zhang with a total of 13 points .
By the superiority of Ma , it did not develop the expected matching match .
But there were still enough breathtaking balls to see .
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4 : 1 .
The white rusher had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against German champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov , who was then in medical treatment , had to settle `` ultimately '' with Blech .
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner ( 38/2004 ) and Jörgen Persson ( 42/2008 ) were , by the way , in similarly high table tennis .

Here comes the Enforcement trailer
Germany 's Raser must adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various German states , including Hesse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are meant to be particularly effective .
The futuristic Enforcement trailer of the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
For example , at highway construction sites or rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed with a stationary flash .
However , a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly .
The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient : its battery holds five days for continuous measurement operation , and the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
Laser measuring technology can also cover all vehicles across multiple tracks simultaneously .
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans after time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
In high condition you can move the trailer , according to the manufacturer , with each car with trailer clutch .
In order for it not to be simply cloned , it is lowered in the measurement operation , so that the wheels disappear in the armored and , by the way , shot-proof external hull .
In addition , a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flash from vandalism .
Since 2015 , according to Vitronic , the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used .
Foreign authorities also flash the new technology : recently , France has recovered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .

The right-wing `` identity movement '' has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
According to several national offices , the constitutional protectors in the federation have also placed the group under observation .
`` We see in the ' identitarian movement ' evidence of aspirations against the liberal democratic basic order , '' said constitutional protection chief Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
Thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or of the Middle East are being defamed in an extremist manner .
That is why we are watching the movement .
The `` identitarian movement '' is a grouping with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
It is opposed to `` multiculturalism '' , '' uncontrolled mass immigration '' and the `` loss of its own identity by over-alienation '' .
Constitutional protectors in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hesse , Berlin , Baden-Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the `` identitarian '' .
Maaßen said his authority had agreed closely with the national offices in the decision .
`` Groups like the ' identitarian movement ' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , '' said the constitutional protection chief .
In general , extremists try to raise them with youthful language , often with pop music .
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists .
This is not an advertisement for your own cause .
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally .
Young people are particularly vulnerable .
This is dangerous .
Most recently , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of `` identifiers '' to AfD politicians .
Maaßen said he did not have any findings .
For constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view .
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist , changes their target and becomes so extremist .
The decisive factor , therefore , is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
This is not apparent .
In view of the marked increase in the number of crimes committed and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , he said that he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context .
In recent years , however , we have found that there can be right-wing terrorist structures .
There was the Old School Society or the Freital Group .
It may well be that there are other right-wing extremist groups or micro-groups who are planning attacks against asylum seekers , against refugees or attacks from other extremist motives .
However , a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not visible .
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Worried about the fact that there were many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared on the right scene .
That is the worrying thing .
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene .
`` So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists , who were perhaps politically indifferent or elected , for example , the CDU , SPD or the left , who then radicalised themselves through extreme right-wing extremism '' .

Queensferry Crossing : bridge now linked to Fife
The £ 1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the north deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife .
It is the first of four closures of the `` cover blower , '' which is nearing completion around each of the bridge 's three towers .
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 swirls .
The £ 1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017 .
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
He said : `` this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry crossings .
We are all witnesses to an engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone .
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit .
Overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge checks are in their place and the final section of the deck gets a betting ring for the deck today in Rosyth , which means the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge constructors said : `` the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
In this fantastic project , the shutter represents forward-looking high and deep construction .
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower deck , we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side .
This was achieved by dragging the northern accessory bridge 700 millimeters south .
This was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate activity .
Massive , as the viaduct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and has had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3 % .
Delicate , as the tolerances to which the team was working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres away .
Fortunately , everything went very well .

More than just a Kardashian reality TV star , KENDALL is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
KENDALL Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue .
KENDALL , who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to the Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday .
`` In a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this cover to the cry , '' wrote KENDALL .
The unveiling of the covers followed a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar ? ) , scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family ( with the exception of problem cases Rob and Caitlyn , and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic twist : they have all planned a surprise party .
That represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children 's show ( Seacrest brought the sentence , '' you would have forgotten that we had forgotten you ? , '' with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a sink at 8 o'clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity .
With a view to the September issue of Vogue , a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun .
Kendall 's big sister Kim may have beaten her on the Vogue cover ( she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year .
With a scale that resembles an imagery rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertisers ( Laut Fashionista were advertising from the 832 pages of rolling 615 pages of advertising ) .
The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that images of the magazine leaked in the past two years even before the official announcement .
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In recent years , there have been clearly more `` celebrities who are modelling '' as `` models who are celebrities '' on the cover .
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady Gaga had the honor .
But even with the low chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the `` breakthrough model '' of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video ( even if it is all about Jenner ) .
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career .
Of course , Jenner 's success does not suit everyone .
With her reality TV story , Jenner 's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense .
In June , the former Victoria 's Secret model criticized Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called it `` the mist of the moment . ''
Those feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover .
But , at the point of dissatisfaction , the point seems to be getting off the ground .
KENDALL Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue .
It is , in the truest sense of the word , a supermodel .
She runs for Marc Jacobs .
She makes adverts for your Grunting of Estee Lauder .
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps .
She sells from her made pictures of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to the magazine LOVE .
And in her spare time she is seen in reality TV , presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children .

Relationship STAT in Bargteheide - man shoots at life companion
A 35-year-old man fired at his partner at about 10 : 45.00 a.m. on Friday at a multifamily house in Bargteheide ( County Stormarn ) and fatally injured her .
`` The man himself called at us and indicated to have shot his life partner , '' a police spokeswoman said .
The perpetrator is on the run , after which he will be publicly punished .
Now nationwide , because Sven S. could be traveling by car .
The man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown , and has a gossip .
Meanwhile , police have released a photo of him .
It is a few years old , though .
Meanwhile , the man wears a glitch .
The man is not supposed to be addressed directly .
He could still carry the gun at himself , police said .
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
The police are talking about a `` relationship '' .
The victim was born in 1988 , the perpetrator in 1981 .
The police in Lübeck initially did not want to give details of the behaviour or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim , but confirmed that a person had been killed .
`` It is a killing offense . ''
`` More we are not saying at the moment , '' said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck .
According to eyewitnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SEK ) was at the scene .

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass exodus
`` Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases , '' says the chairman of the Gülen-close foundation dialogue and world , Ercan Karakoyun .
In the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum-seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term , it could even become `` some hundreds of thousands '' , believes association chairman Ali Toprak .
Following the coup attempt by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the attempted coup , the Kurdish community is expecting a mass exodus to Germany .
`` In the short term , I expect tens of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand asylum-seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , '' says association chairman Ali Toprak of the `` world '' of Friday .
Because the government overran Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago , 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey were on the run .
After the sworn coup , secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added .
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey .
`` It can not be that a state that takes even refugees is producing refugees in their own country , '' Toprak said .
The association 's leader lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in ancient towns .
As a result , Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
`` They are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or driven out in the last hundred years , '' said Toprak , who is also a CDU member .
The association chief demanded that the federal government `` position itself as strongly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters . ''
In Germany , too , there is a `` witch hunt '' against Erdogan critics .
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition figures .
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys teachers and other academics .
`` Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan , sits on packed suitcases , by the way , the Kemalists and secularists , '' said Ercan Karakoyun , chairman of the Gülen-near foundation dialogue and education , the `` world '' .
As the newspaper reported on the basis of figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks , even before the coup , represented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany .
At the date of 30 June , this was 11,386 people , representing almost 29 % of the total eligible for asylum ( 39.625 ) .
This survey is not based on war , poverty or lack of prospects .
According to the Basic Law , asylum is only justified politically , in other words by the state , individually persecuted .

Snapchat ' Anime ' effect as Asian cartoon criticised
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired , but some observers say it is insensitive to races .
With its filter tool , Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are blunt , self-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day .
All mistakes are made to the public .
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past , accusing them that the app would promote Blackface or promote white skin as a beauty deal .
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them sledgehammers , false teeth and inflated cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - `` yellowish . ''
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat told reporters that it had deactivated the feature .
The company offered an apology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters rather than a caricature of Asians .
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of offending cliches .
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison .
In an e-mail , Grace Sparapani , a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely circulated about the photos , said the filter was `` vulnerable and to say the least unpleasant . ''
She added that `` it is difficult to argue with the backlash of a very restive Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not yellow , but that the yellow face has been drawn to the abysmal extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company to cross this cultural stumbling wire .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands .
And Snapchat 's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
When one of Snapchat 's filters generates an image that is offensive to a user , '' so it is much more difficult for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be , '' said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account urged others to do the same .
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag : _SHARP_ DeleteSnapchat .
`` Either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , '' said the Chinese-American Zhu , '' or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what is against . ''
Others share her opinion , a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered .
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but , according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a personnel manager focused on under-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
For her part , Zhu said she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added , '' I wonder if they need more users like us to say that is not O.K . ''

Better flow of traffic on the motorway
It regularly blew up on the bypass - here 's a picture of Nov .
But this is about to change : the legal trajectory is to be extended .
This is good news for all car drivers who are standing in the traffic on the ambient road every evening when travelling via the motorway ( A 43 ) .
Road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16/17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße .
Motorists can then walk directly from the hammer road to the right .
The great advantage : the traffic divides at an early stage , improving the overall flow on the very busy section of the Bundesstraße 51 .
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district agency of Münster-West .
The road narrowing on the accessory nerves motorists , especially between 5 and 19 pm .
On weekdays , the backlog extends to the bridge over the Albersloher route and sometimes beyond .
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the departure of Weseler Straße .
From here , traffic will only be channelled across the motorway bridge .
The second track had to be rebuilt well over three years ago .
The reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the required capacity to capture , in particular , heavy goods traffic .
It is not possible to say how long this bottleneck and the associated daily traffic jam will continue .
However , for years to come , the bridge has an official residual use up to 2034 .
For the extension of the legal trajectory , the national company has consciously chosen the weaker time in the school holidays because of the risk of disability .
Traffic will pass through the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .

Destination plates : who is actually buying records ?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates .
Before you rush to the commentary to sow it under the pseudonym of non-alleys with rough insults , this statement is derived from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to midlife nostalgia .
Those who have recently bought a plate are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54 .
In fact , the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group .
It is also not hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But do the results of YouGov vote ?
If this blog were a news report on television I would follow the camera while running in the middle of a busy street in Soho , wearing a modest grey suit , wearing a modest gray suit before standing , holding my hands and saying something determinate like : `` so let us take a closer look at it . ''
So , let us take a look at it .
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to gauge their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I got from Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men of middle age ) into Reckless Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
`` I appreciate already , '' he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
These records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e-mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and plucked .
`` A lot of things I buy are from the late sixties , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 , things where I was probably a little too young to buy them , '' he says .
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and would like to spend time alone , adding : `` I do not smoke and I do not drink very much .
That is my truck .
WEZ , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many clients he meets will apply to the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pub , people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy back their old records .
From the conversations I have had , people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again , '' he says .
That would explain the boom to supporters of the record reviewer of a certain age .
But what about the supposed emotional importance of plates ?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people .
According to WEZ , some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system .
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record hulls , of objects that call for happy youth memories .
`` I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation , '' says WEZ .
That is so with me as a collector and I think it is like that with a lot of people .
It is an easy way to deal with mentally .
`` We are like their social workers ! '' flutes an employee from a record stack .
An ICM poll in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a plate last month had not heard it yet .
The survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own a record player .
At this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while blowing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men of middle age ) , has noticed a `` trophy aspect '' of the revival .
`` Someone just came here recently and said , ' I do not have a record player , but I would love to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf , ' '' he says .
This is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
More product-laser , less musical .
We have people who say , '' I do not have a record player . ''
These are younger people , not older ones , who are slow to come out .
Fopp , who has devoted the record to almost an entire floor , has a blower audience when I rehearse .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists who take photos , teenage boys and middle-aged women .
Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drunk from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
None of them looks terribly lonely , but nagging mental trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been running around in the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of the plates for sale .
It is more of a showcase than a big purchase .
She does not deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It is easy to hear music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... `` she drives off with a loving sigh .
I do not know how to explain it - it is really unique .
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Outfitters .
While I seem to be giving the jeans hotpants to patterns , I watch a group of young teenagers who group up for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player .
To the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are merely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
It is pure `` record art . ''
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like plates .
Even though my research revealed that YouGov 's results are true , they , at least in record stores in Soho , do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality , record shops and in online forums .
These people probably work hard at school or in offices .
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through record-setting shops of Berwick Street and leaves through plates as they mimic the startling look of an uncanny , 30-year-old false presenter who rises over the shoulders of nothing middle-aged men .

What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis .
In December 2014 , he first picked up gold at the short-track world championships in Doha , setting his first world record at the same time .
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has protected himself via Facebook against his ex-teammates in the critique .
`` In a country where an Olympic champion gets a € 20,000 premium and a jungle kingdom € 150,000 , no one should be surprised about missing medals , '' the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday .
The support system in swimming is bad , but the doping controls are very good .
This means that we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the issue of doping , or even do it .
`` I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here , '' he continued .
If he wanted to start a comeback , Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency , Germany ( Nada ) .
That is the way to keep it with countries .
`` Anyone who can not be controlled for a certain period prior to WM/OS by independent controllers of WADA/FINA should not be allowed to participate , '' asks the pollster , who now runs an ice cream parlour .

Bulgaria booked for first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1 % on a monthly basis .
This is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % was recorded .
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CPI -0.8 % .

Asocial family destroys pre-delocation social housing in Saltash , Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a deluge with damage of £ 50,000 because it had terrorised their neighbours .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash , Cornwall .
After being forcibly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state .
The walls had gaping holes , wooden diapers were ripped up , rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was tasted to the walls .
The family have been resettled and it is thought she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy , who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing , said she feared the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
She said : `` it has been an absolute nightmare for people here and I am of the view that people do not have to live this way .
There are many things to consider , as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall .
The family is notorious and their reputation is also .
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and police said the terror that the family had inflicted had included street battles with baseball sleepers , intimidating residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive cries , strife and flukes .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June .
In some rooms of the house that may be demolished , old garbage was found
In the property in which drugs were traded in the past , the wooden diapers were ripped up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing deluded her and her partner this week violently from the estate after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out .
The delogization was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made to hell .
One said : `` they did not care about anybody . ''
We lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
`` This morning we could not sleep . ''
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
Now where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities .
The family lived in the house , to which the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years
Rubbish and old toys were dumped on the overgrown side of the townhouse
He added : `` it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as a delusion is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering .
This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that has been done by my team , the police of Devon and Cornwall , as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and who have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated .
FITZPATRICK said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
A dirty mattress left in one of the house 's bedrooms after dehydration on the floor
Home management workers will now have to clean up rubbish mountains that surround the house
In 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and cash of £ 1,700 .
Skeldon received a fine after she pleaded guilty to possession of a class B drug in trading terms .
She claimed the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
After they were without shelter , it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti .
Police say they will delve tenants who do not adhere to house order
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police said that the delotion was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not abide by the house order .
`` This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusation , as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior , '' she said .
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Rio 2016 : Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internethit
The Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games .
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
In the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia was so slow that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times .
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected .
In the social networks , Habte subsequently became a viral internethite .
In fact , the 24-year-old finished his previous run with a back-to-back 48 seconds and clinched the 59th place of 59 starters .
But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics ?
The Ethiopian got a special start from the international swimming federation .
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more known .
Since most athletes are running in aesopia , Habte simply wanted to do something else .
Preparation is all : Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race .
The first nicknames quickly made the round .
Some media described him as `` Robel the Wal . ''
Following a `` welfare bite '' , the English tabloid `` The Sun '' was funny with `` Dad Bod '' .
His time , he first struck with a minute and nearly five seconds left over the 100-meter freehand , played no role there .
Comparisons with `` Eric the Eel '' were also drawn .
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics , the run of Eric Moussambani provided media attention .
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea , when he had to compete on his own in an advance over 100 metres .
Frenetic , Moussambani was fired at the time .
The then 22-year-old first learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Once squeezed over price from the market , Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
Of course , prices have been squeezed out of his Bedford Avenue store front .
The store soap Cherie , which replaced verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cupcakes .
Locals cheered it as the last loss in a gentrified city .
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , '' I know New York is changing , but I still can not believe that CBGB dead , the Chelsea Hotel excepted and Verb is now a soap business . ''
But if New York is changing , it is also reinvention .
A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere .
The coffee is still good , too .
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a longtime employee of the old cafe who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
When he offered a client to provide funds for a new outsider , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , blasted a lot .
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
He introduced new ingredients .
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sauced onions .
There are natural bowls .
The cafe no longer serves beer , there are fresh juices for it .
After nine months , Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
`` Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg , '' he said .
Recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer .
OLIVEIRA , 34 , previously lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb on a regular basis .
Even after she moved to Greenpoint , she would take the road .
After the verb closed , she gave up the coffee rink for a while , she said .
`` I became clear that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , '' she said .
Now she is drinking coffee again , even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal is another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
He went there before the work and invariably ordered the same .
`` I came quarters after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they are preparing my Everything bagel with butter , '' he said .
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
Nowadays , Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he switches his Everything bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said he had no grudge about the soap business taking the old business room .
In fact , the owners of the soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cafe 's cold-blooded coffee as an ingredient .
`` I think we are still going to go down on their offer , '' said Rodriguez .
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe .
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to issue it soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
The location also has other advantages .
A local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold coffee .
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a nearby building .
For many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
When the new cafe opened , Whitt said that entering the premises and ordering a new coffee was felt like a return home .
`` I had to smell that , '' he said .

Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania : `` go where it hurts ''
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , they understood .
In 2021 , the election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , and the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
Because blighter than it has been so far , it is not : summer vacation , heat and land election campaign - that bites .
The locals , who are to be persuaded by the pollsters , are on vacation .
The vast majority of holidaymakers travelling in the country , on Usedom , Rügen or Hiddensee , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country day .
In addition to this , there are practical problems : during the holidays , helpers hanging up posters , blowing up balloons , distributing flyers and counting votes at the end of the day are difficult to find .
Until September 4 , 2016 , the last day of the election , Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has yet to campaign .
The hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
And it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , leader of a SPD/CDU coalition , must fear for his office .
The SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU in polls .
Exciting is how much novice AfD cuts off and what is left coalition dust .
Sellering , 66 years old and has been head of government since 2008 , is making an almost unobtrusive campaign , seen by his granddaughters .
He travels through the country , distributes roses and chats a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor , Harald Ringstorff , did .
Otherwise , Seelering has got cold feet and is blaming Chancellor Merkel on the inheritance of the AfD .
Her refugee policy , her `` We create that '' has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists , which is likely to cost him the nice job now .
The CDU , with its top candidate , the Home Secretary Lorenz Caffier , has already experienced what it is like to campaign at the wrong time in the right place .
She has invited twice chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies ; Merkel 's federal election circle is in the northeast .
But the target group did not vote , it was more North Rhine-Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern .
`` There was probably the majority from other states , '' said Vincent Kokert , general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , recently in the NDR .
But it is also a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
Otherwise , the Northeast CDU largely abandons the usual campaign stalls on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and air balloons .
That , Kokert says , is just playing a `` minor role . ''
The Union , too , has noticed that it is basing itself on the land , that it has to make an effort to find a wire to the people .
It is like the left , the SPD , the Greens : there is little in the way of the country .
However , the CDU campaigner Kokert 's advice to his fellow activists is also self-defeating : `` you have to go where it hurts , that is where the people are : Dorffeste , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used '' .
Because much is at stake , Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly dedicated campaign .
In surveys , the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and just before the AfD ( 19 ) .
In the 2011 election , the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , small party with seven percent in the polls , are likely to make the leap into the country day .
They make a modern virtue out of holiday hardship and largely put their campaign on the Internet .
`` Online campaigning '' , it calls the country 's president Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green campaigners are embarking on track searches for local voters among holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , the top candidate , winds straight up with a houseboat through the mecklenburgic lakes and still finds it beautiful .
Her impression : `` election holiday in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment '' .

A controversial baseball star emerges
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the U.S. baseball star in best days from Base to Base .
After his emotional resignation announcement , the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay rays .
`` I love this game and this team . ''
`` I say ' Goodbye ' to both , '' explained the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League baseball ( MLB ) .
Rodriguez was voted the league 's most valuable player three times , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signature under a ten-year contract awarded him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
Until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - on full salary .
As a player , it paid Rodriguez back with performance for a long time .
With 696 homers , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( `` runs '' ) for the Seattle mariners ( 1994-2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001-2004 ) and the Yankees since 2005 , he made some milestones .
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie mays , only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
But in baseball 's glory hall , the 41-year-old is not likely to be included .
Because so successful Rodriguez - nicknamed `` A-Rod '' - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
As early as 2009 , the superstar at `` ESPN '' admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 , it was closed for 211 lots due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect , for years , to have received performance-enhancing funds through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida .
After a legal battle , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
`` The league might even have done me a favor for the year 2014 , because I have been through 20 years without a break , '' Rodriguez told reporters at the time .
Even his farewell days do not go straight .
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games , Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench .
`` My job does not include a farewell tour . ''
`` My job involves trying to win every game , '' Yankees coach Joe Girardi said .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and echoed relations with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , expressed sympathy for fans from the Yankee archrival Boston Red SOx .
`` We want A-Rod , '' sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

Relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
In the evenings you get around forever , at night you are awake and in the morning you ca n't think of sleep anymore .
That is far from relaxing .
After all , such problems are in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 % feel their sleep often or permanently as not recovering .
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur ?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances , and they can cause a variety of causes , says Hans-Günter We < unk > , member of the board of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlafforung und Schlafmedizin .
What you mean by this is the insomnie , that is , an insomnia and sleep disorder .
It is precisely the sleep that makes many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagenknecht , a member of the Executive Board in the German Home Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony .
What is behind sleep disorders ?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex .
Behind this can be organic , mental or behavioral factors , but also drugs .
Not infrequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
`` Very early waking up is especially common in a depression , '' says We < unk > .
And it may be that different factors require each other .
For example , if you have a bandwagon , you can be bad , wake up every two to three hours , and perhaps begin to grapple with everyday problems and worries .
That leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
When should you have sleep disturbances to the doctor ?
Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor , advises weed .
The impairment may look very different : one is off , tired , idle , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily appealing , has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache .
To ease the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
Treatment options include behavioral changes , cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
There are hardly any sleep doctors in Germany , says Prof. Ingo Fietze , director of the interdisciplinary dormitory center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin .
That is why , when it comes to sleep problems , you should first contact the doctor .
The can check with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should go to the sleep lab , and what happens ?
For examinations in the sleep lab , medics advise , for example , on snoring with respirators , on sickle dayfatigue , sleep converters or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fietze explains .
You do not really have to prepare for the investigation .
You should spend the day normally .
`` Just please do not make a luncheon , '' says Fietze .
After the swirling , you go to bed at his normal time .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , you wear a nasal glasses , a breast belt and a fan on your finger .
There is also a camera on the ceiling .
How can people get a grip on the problems ?
There are quite a lot of screws that can be used for a better sleep .
Weaving counts : regular sleep and uplift times , not too long in bed , do not go to sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , drink alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start counting immediately and that is not conducive at all .

Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information , puts Committee of Congress firmly
Military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground , a congressional investigator said in a report Thursday .
The preliminary report , prepared by a task force of Republican members of the congressional committee , intelligence committees and the Wehrbudget budget committee , reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how presenters changed their assessments of U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
The Central Command , briefly Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` Intelligence information , typically sent by senior Centcom commanders , regularly marked a more positive picture of America 's efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , '' a newspaper article quoted the report as saying .
`` What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our leaders , '' said Ken Calvert , Republican member of the House of Representatives .
The leadership failures at Centcom extend to the top of the organization .
The 10-page report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces .
Although it does not provide direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State 's threat , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` During the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before Congress were far more positive than the facts , '' the report noted .
For example , a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin as early as April or May 2015 .
Mosul , Iraq 's second largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
`` After months of investigation , so much is clear , '' said Mike Pompeo , Republican congressman from Kansas , in an opinion .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command 's spikes changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq .
Republicans launched the task force after they conceded that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
The report released Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
In addition , further investigation of the Centcom reports is under way by the General Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence .
Democratic members of the News Service Committee released their own findings on Thursday , agreeing with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force .
`` In 2014 and 2015 , the Centcom created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments to ISIL and the Iraqi security services , '' the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee , a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff , disclosed in an opinion .
That process , according to Mr. Schiff , '' delayed the release of intelligence reports , '' damaging the morale among analysts and `` gave overly little room for dissent . ''
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats vowed not to have any indication of White House intervention at the Centcom analysts in terms of a `` certain political opinion . ''
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by `` The Daily Beast . ''
Last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon 's general inspector general , which was taken after complaints from Centcom analysts .
LT. Cmdr . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon press officer , said in an opinion that the Defense Department would not comment on any reports by Congress , while the general inspector general 's investigation was still under way .
But he also admitted that `` experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . ''
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense Department members ) .
Last year 's accusations , however , raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
Critique about intelligence about Islamic State reminiscences about the Islamic State more than a decade ago , when a Centcom analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a document about how , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , George W. Bush envisioned only a small occupying force in Iraq , and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
Last year , the team around Mr. Hooker noted , according to government sources , that contrary to the government 's statements , airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the terrorist group 's financial position , since those temporary refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
That finding , however , has not been released , the Times reported in September .
Centcoms 's then-commander , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , has been criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .

Who is building Braunschweig 's cheap homes ?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more accountable in the future .
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years ?
The SPD proposes a `` living concept '' for the next Council meeting .
But dispute is programmed .
First of all , the question is : who is supposed to build the cheap housing ?
There is no regulation so far .
SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann said : `` we agree with the Greens : anyone who wants to build on urban areas will have to designate 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future . ''
However , the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock .
However , the big point of contention in the town hall , Bratmann said , is `` how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? ''
`` We want investors on such land to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . ''
A new urban housing support programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be funded , is designed to provide incentives .
The problem , Bratmann said , is `` there is still no agreement between the groups at the moment . ''
The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible .
The left still wants tough conditions for investors .
Despite this , Bratmann said , the situation in the housing market is deteriorating .
If the concept of action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration .
More staff is needed .
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
But the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 1260 new homes , which should be built anyway .
But how do you compensate for the loss of some 1300 cheap homes , the promotion of which will expire in the next few years ?
By 2020 alone , it will be 500 homes .
To prevent that , according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm , running ties should now be purchased from the city .
Consideration should also be given to getting housing back into price-fixing .
This is possible in the western city .
At one stroke , the problem could be solved .
Because in the western city , deadlines expire at the end of the year .
Around 1800 homes could be put back into price-fixing for cheap housing .
Only : that is what the owners want , the housing companies do not want .
There will be a drastic increase in the number of social housing in the western part of the city , away from the objective of the so-called mixing .
There should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city .
The Greens expect there to be some movement in the debate .
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says : `` for a broad majority , the CDU needs to go on board . ''
That has focused on more building sites for single-family homes .
But this does not mean that a compromise can not be found .

Emmett Macfarlane tweeted , '' Hat the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China `` like a pig has died `` ? ? ? ?
The idiot did not capitalize that they were still on broadcast. ``
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming squad for women : `` this little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection , baby . ''

It was an unhappily chosen phrase , we are sorry it happened. ``
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times at the people who responded to the note on Twitter
Fellow commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald

We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast .
Last night we quickly apologised to our viewers on broadcast and our followers on social media .
To make one clear , Byron 's comments related to the swimmer 's performance and not to her as a person .
Yet they were inadequate and an unhappily chosen phrase . Byron does what he has said , very sorry .
On Thursday afternoon , MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment , saying it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
`` I would love to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women 's swimming squad in the CBC Olympics , '' he said .
`` I was referring to the performance of the swimmers and not to them as a person . ''
Of course , no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry. ``

Frankie Dettori reaches on Predilection his 3.000th win at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3.000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British win at Newmarket on Friday .
He set a milestone on Predilection , which is trained by John Gosden , on his local circuit with his second win of the night .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
The three-time winner Dettori , who won before Ghayyar , said : `` it is something special . ''
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago .
It is not a big meeting , it is not Royal Ascot - it is a banal Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am relieved and very humble .
Dettori takes the jubilation as he takes on preaching the victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the impeachment race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who scored more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the nine-time Derby winner , had 4.493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved before him .
He has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
He is a fantastic ambassador for race , his enthusiasm and charisma has excited fans for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a couple of weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked up 6000 profits if he was not just a weekend and big-tournament jockey !
Frankie has already won almost 30 years of winners in GB , which is great .
He has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that , he is an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
It was nerve-wracking .
A whole series of major tournament wins , including his famous `` glorious Seven '' in 1996 in Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
Three years ago , he initially had trouble returning from his six-month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubles and return to his best form .
And he is still far from the end - Dettori once said he wants to continue in competitions until his at least 50.th .

Clinton 's and Trump 's economic policies in comparison : it 's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - that is what both Clinton and Trump want .
However , the two US presidential candidates are divided on fiscal and energy policy , as well as on a fundamental issue .
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental , more philosophical difference .
The , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
He himself would be very different , claims Trump .
He will drive back regulation massively , and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , however , says the state has certain tasks to perform , it has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it .
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich , she says .
Interestingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
It must be invested in , say , Trump and Clinton almost word-for-word .
The Democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies , and are strongly opposed by Republicans ' state-critical teaparty-wing .
So there could be partisan discussions on Trump .
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the US .
Oil production is also expected to be possible in areas protected so far , and the Paris climate agreement is to be terminated .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with her investment program , and demands that `` a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs . ''
`` It will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . ''
But not only in terms of infrastructure , but also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
TPP , the trans-Pacific trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
At the same time , both do not want to isolate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
They are also supposed to be paid better , asking for Clinton .
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 is a starvation wage .
It wants to raise it to $ 15 an hour .
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear : once , he says , the minimum wage must be up , then he says he should not be changed .
But the big debate in the coming months is likely to be more about the fiscal policy of the two camps .
On the one hand , Trump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth .
His critics believe that this would only increase the budget deficit .
On the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to ask the wealthy to pay more tax , and whose critics say more taxes are not the solution , either .

Greenland shark : the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter .
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna .
He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland sharks only get young people with 150 years of age .
The Greenland shark boils down at the bottom of the North Atlantic , and in an hour , on average , it is just 1,220 metres far .
Only when it arrives , the five-metre long animal speeds up to a saturated 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast with this maximum speed as a seal .
This lonely lifestyle , however , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal `` science '' , in any case , from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old .
`` Madness , '' said Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute of demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for vertebrates .
Of course , the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will be staged .
Just lacked the evidence .
Greenland sharks are hard to observe , after all they live in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they tend to dip on the surface only in winter .
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks .
They were at a time when they had six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen .
Looters do this sharks anyway : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swallowed the jaw of a young polar bear .
They may hunt down sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for carcasses that tore down from higher water layers .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland sharks , which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 502 centimeter measured .
To determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lineage of the sharks using the carbon 14 method .
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks , the proteins contained in it are not renewed later .
The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon-14 in the linescore .
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 ' s , when nuclear weapons tests brought greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
On the other hand , in the 220 centimetres of the third smallest animal , the nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
In contrast , all the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lineage , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
In fact , the carbon 14-watch for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 , while the record shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old .
The fact that Greenland females only get young people when they are longer than four metres was well known .
Now the researchers of the length have been able to assign an age .
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the brink of sexual maturity and their age was determined at 156 years of age , Greenland sharks are apparently allowed at least one and a half centuries .
This , too , is likely to be the world record for vertebrates .
It is no coincidence that such methusaleme is mainly living in icy waters .
Also , the previous record holder , a 211-year-old Greenland whale , in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip , was caught before Alaska .
The low temperatures often include the organism of the animals living there .
So they mature later - and aging more slowly .
In order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant .
Another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
`` So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible , '' explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein .
A very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources in a long life .

The £ 2-a-day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after being advised by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time .
The grinning drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
The regulator NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year enrollment to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
The regulator NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year enrollment to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fatty materials in the artery walls that form the siege .
If the bag breaks apart , it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
When the blood clot dissolves , it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
Ticagrelor , which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique , reduces that risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely .
NICE 's bond proposal , published today , recommends a 12-month enrollment of 90mg Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center said : `` despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . ''
Fear of another heart attack may have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
Experience shows that Ticagrelor , in combination with aspirin , is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit .
The information about the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .

B27-rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from closure
There is nothing to tinker with the speed with which the B 27 is being cleaned up .
There is a lot of praise for those responsible for the construction work , which starts at 5.30 in the morning and does not end until 20 : 00 .
`` They have made it all pretty tender , '' says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet petrol station .
That is a super team .
There is also no delay .
The construction site could be moved to the south at half-time by the end of October , and everything will be ready by the end of October .
Praise will also be given to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up temporary vehicles .
Since the construction site migrated to the south on Monday , and the closure of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to ROTTENBURG has been restored , the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed .
Citizens can now move from Ofterdingen from the B 27 .
The alternative traffic through the place seems to go back .
`` There were some significant complaints there , '' says the deputy chief executive , Florian King , who is responsible for the transport management of the remediation .
The residents of Bachsatzstraße , Steinlachstrasse , Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise , because many trails were searched and more familiar to their Navi than the signage .
Which resulted in some lorries being frantic in residential areas .
As the speed limits were also not observed , the municipality increased the measurement vehicle from Mössingen .
`` There were significant overruns , '' says King , who turned himself in on the location on the spot .
Two to three per minute have already been blown away .
The quickest was traveling at 77 kilometers in the Tempo-30 zone .
Since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become calmer .
For the business people at the B 27 , it is only a small consolation that for customers from ROTTENBURG the road is now open again .
Business people do not like to look in the cards .
But the fact that the B 27-refurbishment has led to revenue collapses leaves everyone who is asked to look through .
However , some are more and some less affected .
Who has less to do with the `` end customer '' , that is to say , for other companies , for which the restoration has little impact .
Even in the case of the car company MAIER , Thomas Sulz speaks of a `` slight decrease '' , but also admits that of course `` the runner-up is missing '' .
Most battered are the locals along the road .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the steakhouse , formerly crown , finds clear words .
This is already a threat .
Not just him , but all the restaurants have hit it `` hard . ''
Customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil were missing .
We have to be happy about every euro sales .
The revenue losses put it at `` well over 50 percent . ''
Road renovation has `` thrown back its farm '' by two years .
Half of his staff have made him redundant .
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been made redundant , the policy would have reacted differently .
Instead , the President of the Government , Mr Jörg Schmidt , responded to a request from Göhner on whether there could be financial compensation , with the reference that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at the B 27. now , it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refurbishment .
Göhner knows from other counties where such a thing has been more generous .
For all the complaints , Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
After all , the family business has been here since 1715 , he points to the long history .
He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management .
If you can 't drive , it is nice somewhere else .
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will come back after the end of the restoration work .
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , Göhner is keeping the impact of the B 27 building on its clientele for the biggest crisis its restaurant has experienced in its long-running history .
Six months of construction work , that is brutal .

Steel - A ray of hope for the German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry has been spared millions of euros in additional costs .
Financial strains that have threatened the industry from eco-electricity extraction are off the table .
It stands by the exemption from the renewable energy levy in the inventories of the German steel industry , said Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the `` Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung '' ( WAZ , Friday edition ) .
`` I am really pleased that we have finally been able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . ''
The European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
The steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year , according to the German industry association .
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission following discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager , Commissioner for Competition .
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works will there be an EEG surcharge of 20 % .
But this , too , is not being raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany 's agreement with the EU Commission on its own production .
This will largely establish the status quo of the previous regime .
Gabriel 's successful effort for the steel industry was particularly important .
`` In terms of our ' steel ' campaign , this is a first step . ''
`` Others have to follow . ''
`` Even in the reform of the emissions trading trade , climate and employment targets are to be weighed up , '' said IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
Last year , the situation continued to deteriorate as the world 's largest producer country threw massive steel onto the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw out Chinese steel group price dumping
Over the course of this spring , the situation has been somewhat relaxed .
On the one hand , import duties imposed on imported steel have an effect ; on the other , the economic outlook in China has brightened .
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday .
Most recently , prices would have been more stagnant .
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Last but not least , ThyssenKrupp did not want to rule out closures of individual works .
Some 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
In July , German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
They produced , with 3.4 million tons , well six percent less crude steel than in the previous month , the economic association Stahl said on Friday .
After a brief increase in May , the manufactured crowd now went back the second month in a row .
Since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year .
The association expects to increase emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .

Future of Portland 's melting plant due to repeal of energy contract
The future of Portland 's aluminum smelting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake , as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts , the energy company said .
That move followed the government 's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant .
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November .
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa 's plant in Portland are at stake .
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk when closing .
In addition , there could be knock-on effects , as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria 's total power generation .
In 2014 , Alcoa completed the Point Henry melting plant , which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alcoa 's melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking a closure .
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AGL , which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley , said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts .
The plant is in the majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina , of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares .
`` AGL assumes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melting plant , '' the company said .
AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called `` backup business '' , which should have come into effect from November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12-month notice period , so they will end in 2017 .
`` From that point of view , AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17 , '' said the electricity supplier .
All potential effects on AGL revenues from FY18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $ 187 million in `` expectation of a termination . ''
Alcoa said the decision to tender the contracts would not affect the `` ability of Alcoas ... to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant . ''
The U.S. company said it completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if it still owes a statement as to why it resigned from the contract .
Analysts are warning about the industry 's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle .
Referring to analysts ' statements earlier in the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland had about 600 megawatts and Tomago consume about 900 megawatts of electricity annually .
Should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [ electricity market ] .
And for us as power producers , that would not be good , '' he said .

Community law centres have 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country 's aid needs are rejected annually by community law centres , while the industry is capitalizing on the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions .
In Queensland , three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unjust delogies and the like - are already dismissed for seeking free legal advice and legal advice .
Legal services of the municipality , which are already over-stretched , are ready for further cuts .
As of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
The director of community law centres of Queesland James Farrell said the latest survey of the National Association of Local Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being turned away each year .
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government 's decision .
`` Queensland 's community law centres are chronically underfunded , which means thousands of people are being turned away from important services you need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crushing debts , families who go through separations , workers who have been unfairly sacked - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows they can not get the help they need .
The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
We call on the Federal Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice , as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis , to immediately lift these budget cuts so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems .
Last year , the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their customer communities and that the Palaszczuk Government is investing in this important work .

Supercup : Barca with worries against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona struggles on Sunday to take the first step to the first title win in the new football season .
The Catalans are competing in the duel around the Spanish Supercup against FC Seville , the replay rising three days later at Camp Nou .
The Doublegewinner must dispense with the inferior cupfinalist and reigning Europa League champion , among others , on Neymar , who is contesting the Olympic soccer tournament with Brazil .
Also missing is Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen .
The German suffered a change in the knee in the course of the training , thus settling the question at Barca at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bravo .
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
Coach Luis Enrique has thus far waived a clear decision in this regard , leaving Bravo in the league but Ter Stegen in most of the rest of the competitions .
Before the first game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness status of the team , which was humiliated on Saturday in a test match of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
Also at 3 : 2 in the Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday , Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know yet .
Sevilla , in turn , has to digest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the `` Supercopa de Espana '' .
Barcelona , with eleven successes so far , is the record winner in this application .

Post rises in trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action .
The interest of other companies in the company appears to be large .
The Post is planning to sell its electric vehicle streetscooter as well .
Shortly , the Group intends to start trading with the transporter .
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market as of next year .
`` We want to get into the sale to third parties , '' a Post spokesman said Friday .
The company has been checking for months whether to sell its self-developed streetscooter , with the letters and packs , to other establishments as well .
Post Board Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always enquiries , for example from craftsmen .
According to the news magazine `` Der Spiegel '' , the Bonn Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles .
In the poetry factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and layer .
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
`` We will take a very , very robust step towards 2020 , '' he had said at the end of July .
I can imagine that we are switching the entire fleet .

Crazy after Kates cycling doubleheader and other famous doppelgers of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of touch this week about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot except Rand and Band , who has proved to be an impressive doubleheader of the Duchess of Cambridge .
But the 24-year-old Olympionicist this summer is far from the only one to have gold struggling athlete , who has his own famous doppelganger - at least not if you are allowed to believe social media .
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that currently flicker on our screens , FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood famous .
The hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in the archery Brady Ellison , left , has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
In addition to Kate 's doubleheader on the racetrack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archery could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio .
The team member of the US team in the archery Brady Ellison caused a onslaught on Twitter after images on which he looked uncannily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star .
In fact , the boyfriend got the madness in social media and admitted that he has already been told since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
`` I myself do not see any great similarity , except for facial hair , '' shared Brady told the Huffington Post .
`` He is a gut-wrenching guy , so I take that as a compliment . ''
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become more central this year : the alluring resemblance between British wide leader Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina , with her big , expressive eyes , is supposed to go through as a doubleheader for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan .
And in the swimming pool , South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years .
One gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the `` athletic version '' of the inception actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett , who has similarly severe eyebrows and lips .
Russian silver medallist Yulia Efimova points out more than just the sun-baked skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord , while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans , a `` athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt . ''
Strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
Not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the couple 's similarity
One Twitter user explained her satisfaction that `` the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical . ''
Indeed , US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes .
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile , which is nearly identical to that of actress Laura Linney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Turte Gabby Douglas , which features its own beautiful , broad smile , similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

Despite diesel affidavits , Europe 's largest car manufacturer has continued to show a plus in the past year , thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets .
However , in July , the core brand VW weakened , especially in Western Europe , and thereby reaped the total sales , as notified by the company in the Dax .
Worldwide , the VW brand sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous month .
In Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were up 14 percent below the previous month .
In Germany 's home market , deliveries rose by almost one-sixth .
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
In addition , there has been a buying back in some core markets through `` changing economic conditions '' .
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British voted to leave the EU , a spokeswoman said .
In the US , where the exhaust affair escalated first , a minus is also on the way .
Great support for VW is the Chinese market .
Overall , the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is still gagged by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , it is only an extradition minus 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles .
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to show a sales stream from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in that time , worldwide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had tampered with a software exhaust test .
In Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops .
In the course of the conversion , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative impact .
After the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
The car manufacturer provides the customer with a `` guaranteed '' certificate after the conversion , but I am not talking about a `` guarantee '' , as was stated in the company circles on Friday .
The reason for this is legal niceties .
The `` Focus '' had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models .
This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Transport Ministry last Monday .
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
`` VW must fully comply with the conditions of my commission of inquiry and the KBA . ''
`` Deviations from them will not be accepted , '' said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , according to the ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all type-approval relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term `` guarantee '' but not , as it was said in corporate circles .
With the broad term `` guarantee '' , Volkswagen sees the possibility that , for example , customers will be able to come back to the new software half a year after conversion - and this could return to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
It is also important , in the interests of the customer , to avoid the possibility that any other damage that has nothing to do with the Abgassal scandal will lead to uncertainty regarding possible warranty arrangements , as has been said .
That is why VW does not use the term ' guarantee ' .

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer .
She is also a social worker on the ground .
Since July , Annika Deuschle has been the refugee agency for Urbach .
The social pedagogy supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger .
It sees itself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , refugee aid workers , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Regine 's customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there , the ferocious wool mill , which has a particular problem .
For example , some - less spotty than the multitude of desirable tasks - meant that when the administration wanted to put out the job .
The search for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work , has just been searched .
But administrative work is not their central area , says Annika Deuschle .
Above all , it is about organization , work with people on the ground , and also behind the scenes , as well as network activity .
The 31-year-old has been around for about six weeks .
It has a 50 per cent stake in three years .
`` It was high time , '' says Regine 's client , that supports Annika Deuschle 's honorary and full-time actors .
There are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
New containers will soon be found in Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognised .
The local authorities are responsible for the connection .
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes .
The costs of building , renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the county office to the municipality and the Jobcentre .
Problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer their apartment .
The search has been very difficult for some time .
De facto the administration does not find any private housing .
So far , it is not working to rely on private housing , according to Deuschle .
Therefore , public housing needs to be stimulated , as it is so beautiful .
So new containers will soon be set up in Wasenstraße .
But only housing is not done .
Perspective is the key word , Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a fixed lead , it is internships , training places , school places , one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants that need to be funded or set up .
`` More places would be good , '' says Regine 's customer .
Many work in the building yard or help house masters , do nonprofit work - and that is motivated and very properly , as Annika Deuschle reports .
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact .
That is ' no employment therapy ' .
But activity does not just mean work .
The day needs a fixed structure , say Deuschle and customer .
People would need to develop a sense of belonging .
So there is a need for offers such as sports , contacts with locals and , above all , language courses .
Professional courses are rare .
So here , too , administration and honorary officials are jumping in .
It is vital that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
The long duration of the procedures is a problem .
They must explain to refugees that it is taking time to bridge the gap , for example , with language courses .
Anyone who eventually feels that he is unable to help anyone in Urbach should not be able to work and be useless , who will never integrate .
The clear majority is motivated .
However , there are also problems , says the customer , '' people who have nothing at all '' , so the work of the Deuschle and the customer is always to motivate others .
All of this is a `` mammoth task '' .
A difficult question : have the two , following recent events , been afraid of radicalisation , even in a small community like Urbach ?
`` No , '' Regine tells customers quite clearly , '' what some might call naive '' .
The helpers , however , are already sensitized .
These incidents are also a matter for the refugees .
They would have the fear that the perpetrators would bring them completely into disrepute .
`` They want to show they have nothing to do with it , '' says Regine 's customer .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
So principal and honorary officials must look for activities on the ground and in the region .
They always have in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach .
Does Germany need a cap ?
To answer this question clearly is to shy away from politics .
Actually , it is unfair to put them on the ground .
`` In Urbach we have not arrived yet where we want to go , '' says Annika Deuschle .
No new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Regine 's customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the existing people in a reasonable way .
These are currently about 100 people , mostly young men .
But if people are in need , they need help , both women agree .
The political situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .

Why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
That is what I imagine under the women 's Olympic team in the tournament , and that for more than one reason .
First , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
And second , this team has three turners , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren `` Laurie '' Hernandez , who have been inspiring for many young girls of other skin color .
The structure of this crew , the Aly Raisman , who is Jewish and Madison Kocian , who is a Catholic , makes everyone proud .
This team finally reflects the US .
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
In the last four years , the number one female Turner has been an Afro-American .
Last year , Simone and Gabby were _SHARP_ 1 and _SHARP_ 2 .
That shows strength .
At the last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered .
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez , as they delivered unexpected but masterful gym routines .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multifight event for women .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We are seeing the top of this sport , but so tournament classes across the country do not look out .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all hit the same road as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team .
They are the `` last five '' because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team , and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer .
But the reality is that Turns is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gyms , which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , deployment , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their Turner and families ) .
The majority of these tournament clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
In these clubs , Turner receives all her training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , trainer of Laurie Hernandez , both have trained their athletes since they started the tournament .
We need to allow the communities of Aun countless young girls , inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie , to have a more affordable and accessible gym .
I founded my tournament of 20 years .
At my events , we have offered free and affordable tournament in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and Hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
In September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high quality tournaments to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
It develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
This combination offers lifetime benefits for health and school and professional success .
It is the inspiration of this team that will make thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that is great .
It is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
This is such an exciting time .
Thanks Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of `` girl Power '' by the Holen of Olympic team golds and thanks , Fass motivated her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

Rain instead of star snuff : hope for weather improvement
The weather caused a stroke in southwest Germany on Friday night , but there is still hope .
The night was ill-suited for clouds and rain to watch the celestial spectacle , said the chairman of Sternwarte Welzheim , Hans-Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday .
The weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see a lot of star snuff in the sky .
The stars are Perseids , which , at 216000 kilometers per hour , are among the fastest stars .
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus , which goes up in the northeast .

Tourists in Portugal panic after a tippling military jet beach overflies
Sunseekers in Aveiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A portuguese P-3C Orion plane of the Air Force set off an incredible fall flight
The Air Force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic after a tipical jet crashed over a full beach .
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity over the sunbathers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal .
The holidaymakers jumped on when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming through the clouds on them .
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-By in social media , said : `` it flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash . ''
Nuno Arroja added : `` I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was down to me . ''
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and went incredibly deep
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to detect them .
The spokesman said that due to poor visibility conditions , the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility , but the air force insisted that security was at no time at risk .
Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , which also killed four people on the island of Madeira .
The Portuguese air force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the circumstances - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Councillor decides unanimously : No Kioskneubau at St Goarer 's Rhine bank
Normally , the St. Goarer investment projects by tradespeople with Kusshand - the retail sector in the heartland is considered to be significantly expanding .
However , the City Council unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkons under construction .
`` In principle , we welcome new tradespeople , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this kiosk does not fit in , '' explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU group .

Podolski Takes With 'Gala ' After Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey .
In Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
For the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is taking place in Turkey .
Before the duel of arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski 's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : `` Business as usual '' is required .
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the crash in July , the government argued that the everyday lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected .
However , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed for the coup attempt .
It does not stop even before football .
Against former heavy icker Hakan Sükür , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant .
So the South Coast , now living in America , is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
South Coast is said to be supporters of preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
While the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact this has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks .
The late-night `` democracy guards '' in public places across the country declared Erdogan to quit on Wednesday .
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan .
Especially fans of the Besiktas Workers ' Club are traditionally not among the president 's friends .
But what unites the bulk of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups .
That 's where even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas .
In the postseason `` Gala '' there will be a special return to Lukas Podolski .
Cologne proved his sporting value in the previous season : With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31-year-old finished his first season as his club 's top scorer .
In the final game against Fenerbahce , he scored the 1-0 victory .
The newspaper `` Fanatics '' cheered him : `` He was the best in the place . ''
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy .
Thanks to `` Poldi , '' the disappointing season for the record holder found a conciliatory conclusion .
After the runner-up K.o in the Champions League , the `` Lions '' also scored early in the Europa League .
In the Süper Lig , it was only six .
The season was not good .
The trophy was the only way to win something .
`` That 's what we 've done and that 's the most important thing , '' Podolski said .
For champions Besiktas , the game year ran better .
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez , who laid the base for the 14th title with 26 seasons as a Southern League goalscorer .
This is also the reason fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old 's return .
After the coup attempt , the Gomez , who was under contract with AC Florence , announced that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his Euro holiday .
`` If Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , '' the trade magazine `` Kicker '' quoted club leader Fikret Orman as saying .
To do that , however , the striker would have to be willing to give up on about a third of his $ 7.5 million annual salary , Orman stated clearly : `` His salary at Florence we ca n't pay . ''

Future of Portland 's melting down due to lifting of energy contract questionable
The future of Portland 's aluminium smelting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - is at stake , as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts , according to the supplying energy company .
That move followed the government 's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the facility .
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November .
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa 's plant in Portland are at stake .
No fewer than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
In addition , there could be knock-on effects , as the melting process consumes about 10 per cent of the total power generation Victorias consumed .
In 2014 , Alcoa completed the Point Henry melting , which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alcoa 's melting in Portland is losing money and risking closure .
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AGL , which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley , said that it assumes that three other owners will terminate their contracts .
The plant is in the majority possession of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina , of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japan 's Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares .
`` AGL assumes the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , '' the company said .
AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called `` backup operations , '' which should have come into effect from November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017 .
`` As a result , AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17 , '' the electricity supplier said .
Any potential impact on AGL 's revenue from FY18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL said that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual total of $ 187 million in `` expectation of a termination . ''
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts did not impair the `` ability of Alcoas ... to do the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting . ''
The US company said it completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which should have come into effect from November this year , even though it is still guilty of an explanation as to why it resigned from the contract .
Analysts are warning of the industry 's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle .
Referring to the analysts ' statements earlier this week , Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year .
If both plants were to disappear from the market , that would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [ electricity market ] .
And for us as generators , that would n't be good , `` he said .

Amid the Rage of the Olympics , the Zen of trampolins
Wherever you are , how late it is , it 's the Olympics .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspiration .
It 's as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning baton that is passed from the bravado to swimmer to Turner to the triathlete .
You ca n't turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour 's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the battle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there is Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who is at the Olympics for the first time and a woman 's swarm with greats , could well have been among those well-known names to be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer , Turner or even Flood .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline .
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event .
Further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : Air pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
We will always have breast swimming and may rule it for a long time .
But if I 'm likely to make arguments for my particular darling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
Although the trampoline jump has already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it has been so sparse the last 16 years that many of the ones I had interviewed did n't know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
This could also be regional ignorance .
Although the US sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and , by 2012 , had an athlete who made it to the finals .
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share for women .
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline jumping has some outsider charm , in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school than the one for the Olympics .
At this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , just an earthbound enthusiast .
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonish tremor of his never-ending cloudy impact - but also the grace of the gym and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it .
The word `` trampoline '' comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as `` springboard . ''
Up-and-coming victors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and having to make a series of falling movements ( turning , lifting and saltos ) before landing on their feet .
They are assessed according to execution , difficulty and `` flight time , '' according to the official Olympic programme .
Two-time athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
Medal hopes must go on in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down in the playground .
They are chasing not only the finish line or the output wall , but also another derisive target in television broadcasting : That of the world or the Olympic cords .
The purposeful pursuit is nobel , admirable , even fanatical - and it 's enough to even stir a bystander to tears .
But it 's also what I feel even while watching these games as something tiring .
Of this , the trampoline offers breathing space .
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above .
A forward movement is not the goal .
He or she bounces off , seemingly weightless like an astronaut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back up .
Again , there is a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no frenzied attack on the target , no wobble into the distance , just the dreamlike , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It 's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
The women 's qualifying and finals will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
Amid the Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult .
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved through the angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently suggested , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his after-air , new fan base .

Snapchat 'anime ' effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired , but some observers say it 's insensitive to breeds .
With its filter tool , Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already borders on the absurd .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are outspoken , self-twisted tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day .
All missteps are sent to the public .
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused that the app would promote Blackface or propagate white skin as a beauty sideal .
When , this week , some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes , false teeth and darkened cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - `` yellowing . ''
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature .
The company offered an apology : The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters rather than a caricature of Asians .
But outsiders who have experienced racists reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés .
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison .
In an email , Grace Sparapani , a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely circulated about the photos , said that the filter was `` vulnerable and , to say the least , unpleasant . ''
She added that `` it 's difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof , but that the yellow face has been drawn into the derogatory extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural stumbling blocks .
American culture seems to be implicated in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
And Snapchat 's large audience of young people - who are in terms of race various than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
If one of Snapchat 's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , `` so it 's much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be , '' 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account urged others to do the same .
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview , she said that she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the largely white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
`` Either she does n't have a diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so they can make such decisions , '' said the Chinese-American Zhu , `` or they have people with other skin colours working there but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say what to do about it . ''
Others share their opinions , a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered .
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a staff officer focused on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts .
For her part , Zhu said that she will have her Snapchat account closed and added , `` I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K . ''

Frankie Dettori reaches out on predilection his 3,000th win at Newmarket
Dettori spins champagne after a double at Newmarket , which brings him 3,000th profit
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday .
He put on predilection , which is trained by John Gosden , on his local circuit with his second win of the night a milestone .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
The three-time winner Dettori , who won on Ghayyar before , said : `` It 's something special . ''
I 'm very emotional because my family is here too
I 'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago .
It 's not a big meeting , it 's not Royal Ascot - it 's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am relieved and very humble .
Dettori takes the cheer as he picks up on predilection victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernism and it 's no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved before him .
He has style and is strong , but it 's his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
He is a fantastic ambassador for race , his enthusiasm and charisma has thrilled fans for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he 'd already picked up 6,000 gains if he were n't just a weekend and big-tournament jockey !
Frankie has already ridden nearly 30 years of winners in GB , which is great .
He has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that , he 's an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From flying finishes to Flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the showcase of the British flat race for two decades .
It was nerve-wracking .
A slew of big-tournament wins , including his famous `` Glorrich Seven '' in 1996 in Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
Three years ago , he initially faced difficulties when he returned from his six-month ban , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his two-fliers and return to his best form .
And he 's still a long way from the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .

Cats react more sensitive than hangover on cries of juveniles
Biologists have been investigating in Hanover what effect the cries of cat babies have on adult animals .
To their surprise , this also left the males not cold - however , in contrast to the females , they always behaved the same .
Female cats can recognize the grounding level of cat babies at the mistress of the little ones .
They respond by 10 per cent faster on laughs of kittens picking up in great distress , according to scientists from the Animal Medical College and the Medical University of Hanover ( MHH ) .
Hangovers also respond to the cries of kittens - but always the same .
`` Apparently , the acoustic differences between the mistress of less and severely erratic juveniles for males are either imperceptible or not significant , '' said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH .
She is the author of the study , published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology .
In a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten 's screams differed with the urgency of their need for help .
There were a total of nine adult hangovers and eight kittens from the MHH 's livestock .
They were played to a cries of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings .
On the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more erratic kittens , which were additionally uplifted .
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample .
`` All the females , even the ones who have not yet had their own offspring , responded differentiated to the screams , '' Konerding said .
They turned more quickly to the speaker when that cries of the very errant kitten played off .
This ability may be incensed or developed with sexual maturity .
`` One surprise was that the males reacted at all , '' the biologist said .
In the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises several times in humans .
Also , some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the biologist Marina Scheumann reported .

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass exodus
`` If you do n't adapt and Erdogan praises , sit on packed suitcases , '' says the chairman of the Gülen-nearby Foundation Dialogue and World , Ercan Karakoyun .
The Kurdish community of Germany reckons in the short term with tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term , it could even become `` a few hundred thousand , '' believes the association 's president , Ali Toprak .
Because of the crackdown by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass exodus to Germany .
`` In the short term , I expect tens of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , '' says the association 's chairman Ali Toprak of the `` World '' Friday .
Because the government has already covered Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago , 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey are on the run .
After the thwarted coup , there would still be secular and opposition ethnic Turks .
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey .
`` It can not be that a state that even takes in refugees produces refugees in their own country , '' Toprak said .
The union chief lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in alevitic cities .
As a result , Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
`` They are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years , '' said Toprak , who is also a CDU member .
The union chief called for the federal government to `` position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters . ''
In Germany , too , a `` witch hunt '' is taking place against Erdogan 's critics .
I do n't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition activists .
The branding as a Gülen supporter wiped out teachers and other academics ' professional existence .
`` Those who do n't adapt and Erdogan praises are sitting on packed suitcases , by the way , the Kemalists and secularists , '' said Ercan Karakoyun , chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Foundation of Dialogue and Education , the `` World . ''
As the newspaper reported , citing figures from the federal interior ministry , the Turks already represented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
On the cut-off date of 30 June , this figure was 11,386 people , accounting for almost 29 % of all those eligible for asylum ( 39,625 ) .
This survey does not include those fleeing war , poverty or lack of perspective .
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , in other words from the state side , individually persecuted .

Traveller Ian Wright shakes his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a guidebook
A British traveller subjected his immune system and strangereflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe .
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk snapped his wake on a euro note , a railing at Piccadilly Circus , a flush button of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system .
Before licking each object , he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to engage in .
But the experiment , which was filmed under the title `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' brought some surprising results to daylight .
The thought of leaking the flush button of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely repellent , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
On his journey through Europe , Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria , as well as about his own health .
Fortunately , nothing left him livid , more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth .
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
From public vows at train stations to flushing buttons of toilets , the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film , he told me : `` Already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film , he definitely lived up to his reputation .
The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
His trial cut showed a luminosity figure of over 4,000 units .
In comparison , the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after her Luminometer number was over 4,000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish maker of dairy products Valio produced the travel film `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , '' which shows the bacteria count in different places such as the bathroom
In the film , he says : `` This comes down to the worst thing I 've got in a toilet , close . ''
There is nothing worse than that !
I 'm not going to lick anything here because it 's disgusting here indoors .
`` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio .
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus , which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Valio 's senior Venice president for snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` We really wanted to offer consumers something new .
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics .
We carried out crazy brainstorms that ended with us saying `` Lass us Ian . ''
They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom HAKALA , who directed the film , added : `` Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had yelped some of the things I instructed him to lick , just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film . ''
Of course , there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult .
I 'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . '
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio , 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria .

Why We Need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
That 's what I imagine under the women 's Olympic team in the turkey and that for more than a reason .
First , I 've been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
And second , this team has three turners , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren `` Laurie '' Hernandez , who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color .
The structure of this team , which is Aly Raisman , who is Jewish and Madison Kocian , who is Catholic , makes everyone proud .
This team finally reflects the United States .
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
In the last four years , number one among female turners has been an African-American .
Last year , Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
That shows strength .
At the last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered .
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected , yet masterful gymastic routines .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We 're seeing the top of this sport , but that 's how gym classes across the country do n't look out of place .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all struck the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team .
They are the `` last five '' because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team , and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee .
But the reality is that turkey is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gym clubs , which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , deployment , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their Turner and families ) .
The majority of these gym clubs are in affluent suburbs that can support the business .
In these clubs , Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , trainer of Laurie Hernandez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the turkey .
We need to provide the communities of countless , young girls inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie , a more affordable and easily accessible gym .
I started my gym foundation of 20 years .
At my events , we have offered free and affordable turkeys in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and Hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
In September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer youth high-quality turkeys that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Turns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for educational and professional success .
It 's the inspiration of this team to get thousands of young girls to be interested in the turkey and that 's great .
It 's so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
This is such an exciting time .
Thanks Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of `` Girl Power '' by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thank you , fass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

Adblock Plus , Facebook in `` cat and mouse game '' regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circumvent ad blocking are tantamount to a `` cat and mouse game . ''
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad lockdowns on its desktop site , Adblock Plus released a blog post announcing that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change coding regarding its advertising ads to make it more difficult to detect the detection of which part of the site is advertising .
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes .
In a blog post , the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that `` this kind of back-and-forth fight has already been underway between the antimised open source community and the revellers since the invention of ad blockers , '' and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's largest company has entered the fight on social media is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry .
Globally , according to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe , some 200 million people use ad blockers ; nearly four times as much in 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile terminals , mobile advertising makes up 84 per cent of advertising revenue Facebooks .
The company has it on ad blockers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook 's mobile app for the social network and Instagram , a spokesman said .
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook considers the investment of such a step to be worthwhile .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its `` ad preference tool '' to allow people to have more control over advertising aimed at them .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that Adblock 's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
`` For users , this does not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , '' a spokesperson told Facebook in an email message .
Ad blockers are a blunt means , which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people 's hands .

Community legal centres point out 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country 's aid needs are dismissed annually by community legal centres , while the industry is grappling with the impact of further funding cuts on already overstretched transactions .
In Queensland , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence , and those who do not have funds for unfair Deloitte and the like - are being turned away at their request for free legal advice and legal counsel .
Legal services of the community , which are already overly busy , are getting ready for further cuts .
As of June next year , it is envisaged that these legal centres will lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
The director of the community centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centres found that thousands of people are already being turned away each year .
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government 's decision .
`` Queensland 's community legal centres are chronically underfunded , meaning thousands of people are being turned away from important services you need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crushing debts , families who go through divides , workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows they ca n't get the help they need .
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017 , meaning thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
We call on the attorney general and federal regulators , as well as senators of Queensland George Brandis , to immediately lift these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
Last year , the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
It is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their client communities , and that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work .

Restful night : Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening , you walk around forever , at night you wake up for hours , in the morning it is no longer possible to think of sleep well before the Weckerringing .
This is far from relaxing .
After all , you are in good company with such problems : According to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
What about sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
There are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can be based on a variety of causes , says Hans-Günter Weeß , Executive Director of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine .
What you understand landly underneath , though , is the Insomnie , that is , an entry and sleep disorder .
It is precisely this sleep that many people find unsatisfactory or insufficient , says Jens Wagenknecht , a member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony .
What 's behind sleep disorders ?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex .
This can include organic , psychological or behavioural factors , as well as medicines .
Not infrequently , the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
`` Very early waking is especially common in a depression , '' Weeß says .
And it may be that different factors are interdependent .
If you have a bandwagon , for example , can be bad , wake up every two to three hours , and may start to grate about everyday problems and worries , Weeß gives an example .
This leads to strain , and sleep is no longer possible .
When should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders ?
If you do n't sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day , you should go to the doctor , Weeß advises .
The impairment can look quite different : One is cut off , tired , unspent , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily delightful , has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache .
To ease the sleep disorder , it 's important to find out their causes .
Treatment options include behavioural changes , cognitive behavioral therapy , or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Low-level sleep doctors hardly exist in Germany , says Prof. Ingo Fietze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin .
Therefore , in the case of sleep problems , you should first contact the family doctor , Weeß advises .
The can deal with investigations into whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should go to the sleep lab , and what happens there ?
To study in the sleep lab , physicians advise , for example , in snoring with breathing enforcers , at sick day fatigue , at sleep converters or if you do n't find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fietze explains .
You do n't really have to prepare for the inquiry .
You should spend the day normal .
`` Just please do n't do a midday sleep , '' Fietze says .
After dressing down , you go to bed at his normal time .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , one wears a nose brille , a chest strap and a faucet on the finger .
In addition , a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping .
How can people get to grips with the problems ?
There are quite a lot of job cuts where you can start for a better sleep .
What counts is : Regular sleep and rest periods , not being in bed for too long , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to fall asleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately , and that is not conducive at all .

Salzburg 's `` West Side Story '' with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival will present the `` West Side Story '' with Tony and Maria as a tragic daredevil , similar to Romeo and Juliet .
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
A musical conquers Salzburg : The `` West Side Story , '' Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece .
The artistic director , Cecilia Bartoli , wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of the Classic and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
In the orchestral dig the Simón Bolívar orchestra led by the venezonal conductor Gustavo Dudamel : `` This music is full of rhythm , '' he shrugs .
We always say that it is very Latin American .
There are a lot of Latin American ingredients in their pace and their tune .
It 's a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein 's music in our blood !
In this staging , Bartoli plays an older Mary .
She remembers with grudge to her loved one with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
The role of Maria has always fascinated me .
First , because she 's musically extraordinary !
And then there would be Mariah 's personality .
She says it in her song : `` I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and witty and bright . ''
So she is wise , of course , naive , and very passionate .
`` She resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman in , '' laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It 's such an honour for us to work with her .
She 's an immensely generous man .
And Bartoli returns the compliment : `` Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! ''
Conducting is a necessity for him .
You see it in every one of his movements , in his looks , it 's his life !
It 's such a huge opportunity to be able to share this musical experience with him .
We both have a more southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
For American director Philip Wm . McKinley , the `` West Side Story '' is highly topical : `` This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism . ''
Today we have the refugees , at the time the Puertorians went to New York , and the New York residents did n't want them .
It 's the same issues , and they 're just as meaningful today as they were then .
59 years later , the play is still relevant .

Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly : 'It will be better '
Like most 6-year-olds , Edmund Picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
But like the least of his age , Edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother , Elizabeth Picciuto , knew nothing during her pregnancy .
When he first came home , my first thought was , I 'm not able to do that .
I do n't manage that .
I did n't engage in that .
Which is not true at all -- of course you got into it , `` she said .
Her husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund will never be able to recognize them in some circumstances and that he may not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far as to propose to institutionalize him .
`` My first response to that was ' I did n't know that people still do , ' '' explained Picciuto .
Edmund can run with the help of a walking aid .
Edmund could not sit or crawl until his third year of life and he still ca n't speak .
But he is slowly making progress .
He can run with support and bike rides .
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund devised for `` Please sing me something before . ''
`` We bring him sign language , '' Picciuto told CBS News .
But it 's not a typical sign language -- she says . Edmund invented some characters on his own .
Microcephaly has a variety of causes : Genetic as with Edmund , as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy .
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those with the Zikavirus infected .
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked all the time , what will happen ?
What will happen ?
And she still does n't really know .
I have n't asked for the forecast for a long time because I do n't expect them to really tell me anyone .
But Picciuto has a hopeful piece of advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus .
It 's going to be better .
You know it will be better for you .
You will love your child and your child will love you .

De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July , many people were concerned about further attacks .
The state must respond calmly and decisively to terrorist threats .
To be sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists .
If criminals were to leave the country more quickly , however , this adds to the security and strength of popular support for refugee policy .
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals until the 2017 general election .
He also announced a further staffing reinforcement of the security forces , and `` in mid-fourths of magnitude over several years . ''
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be punished again .
Video surveillance is to be improved , gun law revised in such a way as to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet .
The last much-discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be preserved after de Maizière 's words .
However , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions to how to reduce the vulnerability of citizens , he said , referring , for example , to mental health refreshers .
To counter radicalisation of refugees , the minister believes better social care is needed .
Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatised people .
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Darknet ) , de Maizière plans to use covert investigators .
UKIP leader Gabriel said : `` The SPD is willing to talk about anything that helps to further increase security . ''
It is important that the Home Secretary has spoken out clearly against actionism .
`` This was a slap in the face for the executioners in the CDU / CSU , '' Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group ( Friday ) .
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union following a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
He believes that a general ban on full wear is constitutionally problematic .
You ca n't ban everything you reject , and I refuse to wear the burqa .
We can talk about rules , for example , in road transport or for witnesses in court .
Greens leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate offence and ability to act with ever-new anti-terror packages .
Left-wing leader Bernd Riexinger said : `` Fleet spells and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people of this country . ''

Data clutter : So perilous blackmail hackers have their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful .
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America , Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the firms surveyed over the past 12 months have been victims of an attack with extortion software at least once , in part .
In Germany , just under 20 percent of firms were already the target of Ransomware blackmail .
Forty per cent of victims willingly paid the ransoms required by the offenders to be able to re-use the targeted systems and data .
According to the observations of Malwarebytes , the perpetrators are increasingly specialising in attacks in company networks .
If they are successful there , the potentially extortionate ransom is significantly higher than for private users .
`` We are currently seeing an alarmingly rapid evolution of the malicious software , '' explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the `` world . ''
In 2008 , most malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves .
First private users were the target , but the shift to corporate attacks has been alarmingly fast in recent months .
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern : Once on a victim 's computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals in a sustainable manner .
The software then presents the demands of the executors .
To get the end-key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin .
But where the personal photo database is at stake with private users , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
Accordingly , the damage is higher when a Ransomware hits .
Twenty-two per cent of the German firms affected reported sales losses by Ransomware , while 13 per cent even had to interrupt business altogether , in one case people were at risk of death .
In Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records .
`` We always tell the victims : Do not pay , it only promotes the problem , '' explains Kleczynski .
But 80 to 90 per cent of firms that pay will get their data again .
For managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of gridlock in the operation .
The hackers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , F-Secure 's security researchers looked at exploitation surfaces and contact with the executors , and come to the conclusion : The perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to take more money .
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin , target freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free .
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to get their data back unencrypted .
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from Ransomware extortion , the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work , security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos said : `` A single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week . ''
However , it is more likely that there are three or four people .
The programmers then sell their malicious software to the actual executors in the form of a software building box .
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one-off , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
`` Included in the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , looks and branding can be changed , '' says Wisniewski .
The executors are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
So you log into one of the forums underground , buy the set of a criminal and charge another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
Payment is made per infected computer .
`` Usually the criminals then instruct spammers with the spread , '' explains Wisniewski .
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data .
Over 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fend off Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software .
Accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
`` If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful grounding , the perpetrators instead face the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , '' explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski .
As a result , the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
In the future , the perpetrators would also be able to target completely new targets in the Internet of Things .
At the hacking conference Defcon , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control .
In the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom to so many victims .
If the perpetrators then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ransomware could also become an issue in industry 4.0 .

Police : 3 victims shot in serial murder case during music hearing in car
According to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead , who died in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in the first serial killing of Phoenix while they were staying in the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis 's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway , authorities said .
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
Police said that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery , as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 , which was owned by one of the adult victims .
Phoenix Sgt . Jonathan Howard 's police spokesman said that the shootings led investigators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks .
In total , seven people were killed and two others injured , mainly in Hispanic neighborhoods within four months in nine attacks .
`` It is happening in a residential area in front of a house , '' Howard told KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , earlier this month .
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles , including a brown Nissans from the late 1990 `` s , a black BMW from the late 1990 '' s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis 's daughter Maleah still died on the ground .
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
Authorities also released a police report on the shootings , aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed it was the work of the serial killer .
Investigators found patronage and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room .

Queensferry Crossing : Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the north deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife .
It is the first of four closures of the `` cover blowers '' that are nearing completion around each of the bridge 's three towers .
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 oblique ropes .
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Business Secretary Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
He said : `` This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings .
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
In total , nearly 79 % of the entire bridge deck is in their place and the last section of the deck will get a Betonguss for the deck in Rosyth today , meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : `` The first shutter represents a significant milestone in any bridge project .
In this fantastic project , the closure represents a trend-setting high and deep construction .
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expansion of the north tower deck , we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side .
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south .
This was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate activity .
Massive , since the viaduct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3 % .
Tricky because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres .
Fortunately , everything went very well .

Greenland shark : The oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter .
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna .
He was born in 1624 and swims with well over a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland sharks only get up with 150 years of offspring .
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic , and in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 metres .
Only when it gets on , the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a hefty 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robotic with this top speed .
This lifestyle characterised by slowness , however , seems to be a panacea for a high age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science , at least , of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old .
`` Madness , '' comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for vertebrates .
While the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will be stone-aged .
Just lacked the evidence .
Greenland sharks are hard to watch , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
About the lifestyle of Greenland sharks , researchers know correspondingly little .
They measured their slow pace when they replaced six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen .
Prey still make these sharks : In the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a robotic , another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
They may be chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice sea and looking for carcasses that are torched from higher water layers to the bottom .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 off Greenland or Spitsbergen as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long , while the largest 502 inches measured .
To determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of sharks using the carbon-14 method .
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks , the proteins contained in it are not renewed later .
The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core .
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 `` s , when nuclear weapons attempted to inject greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
In the third-smallest animal , with 220 centimetres in length , the lineman , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
All the major Greenland sharks , by contrast , had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens core , which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
In fact , the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimetre Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years , while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old at 502 centimetres .
That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres , it was known .
Now , researchers of the length could be assigned an age .
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was determined at 156 years , Greenland sharks are obviously at least one and a half centuries old .
This , too , is likely to be a world record for vertebrates .
The fact that such methane is mainly found in icy waters is no coincidence .
Even the previous record holder , a 211-year-old Greenland whale in whose bacon on the neck put a 120-year-old harpoon top , was caught off Alaska .
Due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus .
So they mature later - and age more slowly .
In order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram elephant .
Another advantage : They have fewer enemies .
`` So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible , '' explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein .
A very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources more in a long life .

Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after 'Arab ' call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media call after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli preselection as it had `` requested '' Arab guests , according to an employee .
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentary `` Shoah '' left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ .
During his last stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel 's pre-election list .
However , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
Wrote Lanzmann .
Instead , the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own call center .
According to a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The response he received there `` shocked him , '' as Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel worker said that the measure was a `` deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotels . ''
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director .
`` Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted , '' Lanzmann 's employee was quoted as saying .
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a `` great shame , '' the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports .
We were appalled and dismayed by this event .
This is really very shameful .
The fact that this has happened in Germany in precisely this hotel chain is an even greater shame .
This needs no explanation .
We expect the hotel to `` draw the right conclusions , '' the appointee said .
The incident sparked a pretty big response on the internet , where people called the whole thing a scandal .
Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it would have `` caved in '' to the alleged calls of Arab guests .
`` Ashamed of you , '' it said in another post , noting that the hotel , located at the noble Kurfürstendamm , is near a synagogue .
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations of himself and called the incident an `` oversight '' and `` apologized '' at Lanzmann , Der Spiegel reports .
`` There has never been a direct instruction '' not to include Israel in the quick-vote list , `` the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying .
It adds that the country preselection has now been added .

Despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time race , cyclist Tony Martin does n't want to be let down .
`` I continue to keep the World Cup in view , stay confident and continue to fight , '' the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro .
He does n't have an explanation for his miserable 12th spot on the sugar rush .
`` I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday 's time drive , '' Martin remarked .
He had to calmly analyse the reasons for the debacle .
At the October World Cup in Qatar , Martin actually wanted to fight for the title .
'i 'm going to look at everything we 've changed in recent times . '
`` This includes my position , '' wrote the three-time time-driving champion , who had lost on Wednesday on the 54.5 km more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara ( Switzerland ) .

The US wins fourth match in women 's field hockey , a showdown with Britain imminent
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women 's American field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the American won 3-0 .
Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but Bam ( 27 ) said she could n't remember having ever done that .
`` I have no idea , '' she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
However , she knows that : American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place , who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 win against Japan .
Britain and the United States will clash on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals , the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will each gain first and second place .
The first-place finish will leave the strong Dutchman a little longer out of the way leading the other group .
Whatever Saturday 's game may run out , the American people have caused a surprising buzz through their success story , four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats at the past London Games .
BAM was part of that team .
She grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a hockey bat in his hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University ) , at 16 , she became a national player of the United States , the youngest in the team 's history .
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the cadets .
Then came 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
The following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , became coach of the national team and so things started to turn to the better .
`` A culture change , a mental change and a physical change , '' Bam said .
We did n't have the workload in London that we have now .
We 've been able to grab the helm completely .
On Thursday night , Bam opened the goalless in the first half of the game with a backhand shot from close range .
India went into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 down into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands .
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved into the middle and lured the ball into the gate to give the American women a 2-0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the United States , Jackie Briggs , who has so far had one goal in each of the previous games .
She has a run .
Just like Bam .
`` We 're in a good position '' said Parnham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .

Here comes the Enforcement trailer
Germany 's turf will have to adjust to the next generation speed gauge : In various federal states , including in Hesse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are supposed to transfer tempos particularly effectively .
The futuristic Enforcement trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
For example , at motorway construction sites or to rehabilitate bridges with a temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed .
However , a permanent mobile build-up can be too dangerous or time-consuming .
The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient : Its battery lasts five days during uninterrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
With laser measuring technology , all vehicles can be captured simultaneously across multiple tracks .
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
In the high-risk state , you can move the trailer , according to the manufacturer , with each car with a hitch .
So that it is not simply cloned , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and , by the way , even shadowy outer shell .
In addition , a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the Lightning from vandalism .
Since 2015 , the trailer has been tested in different federal states , according to Vitronic , and has now been used .
Foreign authorities are also blushing with the new technology : Recently , France has reordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .

Berlin / Schwerin : Poll ahead of country elections : SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) there are significant losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU .
This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the Bild newspaper ( Friday ) .
While the red-black coalition government in the north could narrowly continue to rule , this is not possible after the polls in Berlin .
In both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to be the leader .
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
The party would be just ahead of the CDU , according to the poll , which could come back to 23 percent .
Third place is controversial between the left and the AfD .
The left would be on 19 per cent ( previously 18.4 per cent ) , while the AfD would be represented at 19 per cent for the first time in the county .
The Greens are hesitating , despite slight losses , with 6 per cent ( previously 8.7 per cent ) back in the weigh-in country day .
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country with 3 percent each .
In the Berlin Chamber of Deputies , according to the poll , the poll would be only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.3 percent ) .
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent .
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.6 per cent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 per cent ( previously 11.7 per cent ) .
The AfD would be represented at 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies .
With 5 per cent , the FDP could be hoping for a return , but the pirates would miss entry in contrast to 2011 .

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
She is also a social worker on the ground .
Since July , Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach .
The social educator supports the management team of Achim Grockenberger .
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors : Refugees , Labour 's refugee agency , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Regine 's customer from the work group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there , the icy wool milk sau , which mainly has a problem .
So some - less spotty than rather aimed at the multitude of desired areas of responsibility - meant when the administration wanted to tender the place .
An administrative expert has been sought with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work .
But administrative work is not their central area , says Annika Deuschle .
Above all , it is about organisation , working with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks .
It has limited a 50 per cent point to three years .
`` It was prime time , '' says Regine 's customer , that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors .
There are large and small problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
Soon , new containers are in the water road
It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognised .
Local authorities are responsible for the follow-up .
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces .
The cost of building , renting or renovating these shelters must be borne by local authorities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the estate agent to the municipality and job center .
Problem : There are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
The search has been very difficult for some time .
De facto , the administration does not find private housing .
So far , it is not working , relying on private housing , according to Deuschle .
Therefore , public housing must be taken care of , as it is so nicely called .
So new containers will soon be erected in the Wasenstraße .
But only with apartments it is not done .
Perspective is the cue , Regine 's customer and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a permanent lead , there are internships , training places , school places , one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or set up .
`` More places would be good , '' Regine 's customer reports .
Many work in the building yard or help house masters , do charitable work - and that 's motivated and very tidy , as Annika Deuschle reports .
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact .
This is `` no employment therapy . ''
Activity , however , does not just mean work .
The day needs a fixed structure , say Deuschle and customer .
People need to develop a sense of belonging .
So there need to be offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
Professional courses are rare .
So here , too , administration and volunteers are jumping in .
It 's central that the refugees feel they are wanted and welcome in Germany .
The long duration of the procedures is a problem .
You have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time in a meaningful way , for example with language courses .
If you eventually develop the feeling , he ca n't help anyone in Urbach , should not work and be unnerving , who will never integrate .
The clear majority is motivated .
The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others .
All of this is already a `` mammoth task . ''
A difficult question : Do the two have fear of radicalisation after recent events , even in a small community like Urbach ?
`` No , '' says Regine 's customer quite clearly , `` which some may call naive , '' but a residual risk can not and would not rule them out .
However , the aid workers are already aware of this .
These incidents are also an issue among refugees .
Those would have the fear that the bombers will bring them completely into disrepute .
`` They want to show that they have nothing to do with it , '' says Regine 's customer .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
So primary and volunteers must look for activities on the ground and in the region .
In doing so , they always have in the background that soon a new blast of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach .
Does Germany need a ceiling ?
To answer this question clearly is to shy away from politics .
Actually , it 's unfair to put them helpers on the ground .
`` In Urbach , we have not yet arrived where we want to go , '' says Annika Deuschle .
No new refugees , that would ease the situation .
Regine 's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy integrating the existing people in a reasonable way .
These are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
But when people are in need , you need to help them , both women agree .
The political world is so complicated , there are no easy answers .

Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in star pile of plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades .
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in starlings rotate at different rates , as well as in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary formation .
`` We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , '' said Luisa Rebull , a researcher at Caltech 's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The star pile of the Plejades is 445 light-years away from Earth .
Many stars in this star cluster , which emerged about 125 million years ago , now reach adulthood .
They are turning fastest now .
At peak rotational rates , these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds .
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slowing effect on the stars .
When a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a discernible stellar fleece -- like sunspots -- .
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones .
`` In the '' Ballet `` of the Plejades , we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars , '' Rebull said .
As the star pile of the plejades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
`` The starlings of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , '' Rebull said .
There is still much in front of us that we would like to learn more about , such as how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and , so to speak , hang their `` dance shoes . ''
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades , which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal .

London schoolgirl who joined Islamic State was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS , reportedly died in Syria .
The lawyer , Tasnime Akunjee , said that her family learned of her death in Raqqa , Syria a few weeks ago .
It was believed she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa , the bulwark of the group in the country , ITV News reported on Thursday .
Sultana was 17 years old and died , according to her family , shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England .
`` One can only hope that the only good thing in it is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - stopping people from ever making that decision , '' Akunjee said .
In February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London stepped into a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultanah 's family have been told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .

Rain rather than stargazing : Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-studded gucker in south-west Germany a dash of the bill in the night of Friday - but there is still hope .
The night was ill-suited because of clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , the chairman of the observatory Welzheim , Hans-Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
Our hope is on the night of Saturday .
The weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see a lot of stargazing in the sky .
The star scales are Perseids , which , at 216,000 kilometres per hour , are among the fastest stargazers .
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus , which goes up in the north-east .

Laws are constantly being slashed in the name of counter-terrorism .
After the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Maizière is now laying out a hefty security package .
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror ?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator .
All his proposals are `` politically reasonable '' to the coalition partner , the federal interior minister says at the presentation of his new security package .
They do n't overcharge anyone .
Other , more far-reaching points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
As Home Secretary , however , he was keen on results and on a `` recoverable consensus '' within the coalition .
De Maizière took a little time to pass after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
But they are all the more extensive .
Some things are already known , announced , pitted : That a new security agency should take care of the crackling of encrypted communications is not new .
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law .
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security agencies comes as no surprise .
In part , de Maizière is launching a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : He wants to criminalise sympathy advertising for terrorist groups , and jihadists with dual citizenship take the German passport .
`` These will be difficult points for the SPD , '' the CDU man conceded .
Nevertheless , he believes that this is reasonable and does not call for anything that has no chance at all with the coalition partner .
A few new ideas presents de Maizière , too .
They have it in part : He plans fast-track procedures for deportations and more opportunities to incarcerate people from deportation .
Refugees who are targeted in the country are expected to check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review .
In acquiescing for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity .
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive .
Some of the work is still unspent and leaves questions unanswered .
And on some points - in the unequal treatment of the patient , for example - the question arises : What does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
Yes , says de Maizière , it 's important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
But there is no denying that the bombers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees .
In addition , many people were worried about safety , given the high numbers of refugees .
And things that people deeply engaged in could not be left out in campaign times as well .
Internal security has been hugely focused .
First the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
The uncertainty is great .
And yes , there are election campaigns .
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
In recent days , it has been high between the two parties .
First a garish battle over the equipping of the federal police , then via a security ideas collection of some Union interior ministers , in which departmental chiefs are also calling for a burqa ban and a move away from dual citizenship .
De Maizière is also struggling here for conciliatory sounds .
He does n't think anything of a move away from the double pass .
We have pacified the discussion in Germany .
Remaking it does n't make sense .
And in the event of a burqa ban , he has constitutional concerns .
Whether his own package is constitutional on all corners , and whether it is actually `` reasonable '' for the coalition partner , has yet to show up .
There is a lot in it that could cause controversy .
But the SPD is also currently trying to stand up on the issue of internal security .
Leader Sigmar Gabriel first signals cautious willingness to talk and says : `` The SPD is willing to talk about anything that helps to further increase security . ''

Simone Biles creates gold in women 's turkey
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all that .
Dynamic on the jump horse .
Effortless on the beam .
Stunning on the floor .
Absolutely brilliant .
And now , finally , Olympic champion .
The 19-year-old American turkey yelled to the multi-match title on Thursday and widened the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympics .
Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medallist and `` Final Five '' team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina .
The American-born Simone Biles Turns on the balance beam during the women 's single multi-game race in the art turkey at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-game title and overall the fifth , while consolidating her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
She broke down in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps , who has brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated her sport the last three years , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Rescue told her that she is `` the best turner I 've ever seen . ''
It expected it to be a final test in Brazil , a contest that did n't go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of outsized expectations .
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment .
The American-born Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace after they each won gold and silver in the women 's single multi-game series in the art turkey at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal Tuesday while serving on the farewell party of retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi as an exclamation point .
Although Biles insisted , during her long walk on the lead , never planned the future , that 's not really true .
Part of their ground exercises - which include her typical Tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
This is no coincidence .
This girl , who was adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman 's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained , became a force .
She has not lost a multi-match contest since the summer of 2013 , a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes .
Even though Mustafina easily led by two turns , the picture was trending .
Floating beams and ground turkeys - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurched .
She picked up again with 15.433 on the balance beam - and still put one on it with a 15.933 on the floor .
Raisman gently hugged her as she awaited her Endergbnis - a mere formality - and tears poured on Biles 's brilliantly red , white and blue Eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
Raisman 's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she struggled for third place , but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina .
This time , the 22-year-old team captain , dubbed `` grandma '' by the Americans , had a head start .
After her ground exercise , she accused the audience of Kusshunds , overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful .
As for Biles , the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-old from earlier this week has a whole new meaning :

Airline not liable : Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
The High Court of Düsseldorf ( Az . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only possible in the case of dangers typical of air transport .
The plaintiff had broken a knee ligament in the fall .
However , the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of death , according to the court .
The airline did not have to pay damages to the man .

Crazy for Kates cyclist 's doughnut and other famous doughnuts from Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come out this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot out of bounds and band , which has proved to be an impressive double in the Duchess of Cambridge .
But the 24-year-old Olympian this summer is far from the only one to have gold fighting athlete who has his own famous doughnuts - at least not if you 're allowed to believe social media .
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces currently flung on our screens , FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities .
The Hunter and the Wolf : Team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison , left , has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kates 's double-hitter on the bike race , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio .
The team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star look incredibly similar .
In fact , the Archers got the madness on social media and admitted that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
`` I myself do n't see much resemblance , with the exception of facial hair , '' Brady told the Huffington Post .
'he 's a good-looking guy , so I probably take that as a compliment . '
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt be even more central this year : The rising resemblance between British wicketkeeper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
Russian turner Aliya Mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , is said to be able to go through as a double-runner for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan .
And in the swimming pool , South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years .
A gear higher : This user believes that Nathan is the 'athletic version ' of the Inception actor
Another lingering comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett , who has similarly severe eyebrows and lips .
Russian silver medallist Yulia Efimova points out more than just the sun-soaked skin and blond hair as the actress Annalynne McCord , while American Nathan Adrian was attuned by fans , an `` athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt . ''
Strong women : Soccer star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one : One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put in the room : According to this user , there may be a reason for the couple 's likeness
One Twitter user explained her satisfaction that `` the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical . ''
In fact , US soccer star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes .
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile , which is nearly identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medallist in the turkey Gabby Douglas , which features her own gorgeous , wide smile that resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

Clintons earn $ 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax returns for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in an income of $ US10.75 million for the Democrats ' presidential candidate and her husband , and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 % .
In 2015 , the Clintons donated $ 1 million to charities , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $ US5.3 million in speaking fees ; the former secretary of state gave an income of $ US3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department .
Clinton 's candidate for the vice presidency , Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia , is publishing his tax returns of the last 10 years , along with his wife , Anne Holton .
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
`` Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , '' Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri admitted in a statement .
In a stark contrast , Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backers in relation to his previous promises to release his tax returns .
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not required by law to do so .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as the reason for his denial .
`` They 're on the train , '' Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter , in reference to the release of the Democrats ' presidential candidate .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump 's special adviser , told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are not completed .
Trump 's critics , including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , have already vowed that his refusal raises questions about wealth , his donations to charities , his business conduct , and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already toppled on the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax returns .
On Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
`` He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns , '' she said to the crowd .
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s for two years , and a business journalist at the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday , saying that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign .
Clinton supports a settlement named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett , who would ensure that people who earn more than $ US1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska called for Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has his seat here , to exchange Trump to a meeting to discuss their tax returns .
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the IRS and that Trump was `` afraid '' of voters rather than the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax returns dating back to 2007 .
The Clintons , who now live in Chappaqua , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
The Clinton 's tax returns of 2015 showed that these were only $ US100 of their income as a wage , unlike most of all Americans .
Their main asset was a low-cost index fund , from which the Clintons taxed dividends and earnings of $ US109,000 .

Olympics : Triple fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya 's athletics faces mischief after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
The International Olympic Committee was told to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
A Kenyan official had been told that the former sprinter and current coach , John Anzrah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich .
This was reported to Kenya 's team management by the doping inspectors .
The world governing body IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case to initiate its own investigations , an IAAF spokesman said .
`` Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC , the IAAF will make an assessment , '' they said in an IAAF statement .
`` He ( Anzrah ) went to the doping control station and turned out to be Ferguson Rotich , cast and signed the sample , '' explained Kenya 's chef de mission Stephan Arap Soi .
He was in possession of the athlete 's accreditation , which was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency .
Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth over 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing .
Four days earlier , Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
He is said to have informed against money-paying athletes from his country about pending doping tests .
According to media reports , he is said to have been arrested on his return at Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping offences .
In announcing the more than 2,000 doping target checks set up by the IOC before the Rio Games , it has been unusually pointed out beforehand that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system .
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began .
As a result , WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with WADA rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
The country 's athletics won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
In a series of television reports by ARD , there have been repeated accusations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he employed them in Russian athletics .
It has been shown that this sport has been widely and systematically doped in this sport .
Russia 's athletics were subsequently excluded from the Summer Games .

Buyers in Primark outraged by woman who tries shamelessly underwear in the middle of the shop
Buyers did n't know where they should look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the midst of a Primark to try undergarments .
To make the situation worse , she mustled as she looked into it , pulled her out and put it back on the shelf .
She continued to stab and tried four pairs of undergarments in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone .
The Primark shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where the woman tried the undergarments before putting it back on the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , `` she moved back in and left the business without buying anything . ''
She said : `` People could n't believe what they saw . ''
Standing in the middle of the sales floor , she took a pair of undergarments from the outlay , pulled out her own tights and trousers and tried them .
'She did n't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , freaking like Oskar . '
'Everyone stared when she pulled out the undergarments that obviously did n't like her as she put her back on the shelf . '
She repeated the same with three more undergarments before she finally decided that she did n't like anything , pulled up again and went out .
'She did n't seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who , in some circumstances , would buy the undergarments she had tried . '
Ms Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : `` How disgusting to think that someone would take undergarments with home who had a different person and who were not washed . ''
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added : `` As I got involved , the staff tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she went - which is just as good . ''
'i 'd hate to go home with a new pair of undergarments and find out that another woman had her and pulled it out again and they were n't washed . '
A spokesman for Primark said : `` Primark is aware of the incident , which occurred on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folkstone . ''
All the products in question have been pulled from the sale .

How to protect yourself with Krav Maga from gun attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you .
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi , a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed robbers at near distance .
Regardless of whether you 're approaching you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the mirror around for your robber .
If you look at you from behind , you should first turn around so you can see your attacker and `` get out of the firing line , '' Mizrachi says .
Then seize the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow .
Then beat him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the assailant curls up in pain , put the gun out of his hands , beat him with the run in the face and move backwards while they put the gun on him .
With attackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , seize the gun and twist it , so the attacker ca n't shoot .
At the same time , shift the weight to the gun and beat the attacker on the chest , then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and turning the gun on him .
Sounds difficult ?
Watch the video to see exactly how it predates Mizrachi .
But remember that in the case of a robbery , it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster .

Destination records : Who is actually buying records ?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates .
Before you rush to the comment section to oversow him under the pseudonym non-AlleEinsamenmen 's middle age with harsh insults , this statement derives from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-talked-about revival of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to embrace the news of physical items , but on midlife nostalgia .
Those who recently bought a record are likely to be aged between 45 and 54 .
In fact , the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group .
It 's also no hordes by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : Older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time on their own ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But are the results of YouGov ?
If this blog were a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I was running in the middle of a busy street in Soho , wearing a modest grey suit and sitting wildly , holding my hands and saying something like : `` So , let 's take a closer look at it . ''
So , let 's take a look at it .
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores .
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and spirits through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Sister Ray ( data count : Two young women , three middle-aged men ) to Reckless Records ( data count : Eight men of middle age , one woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is a day out because of a meeting in London and going through the shops to fill the few hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
`` I guess so , '' he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
These records , shown above ( he sent me the snap by email , I did n't follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : He is now able to buy plates he could n't afford when they appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and bankrupt .
`` A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 ... things where I was probably a little too young to buy them to me , '' he says .
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and happy to spend time on their own , adding : `` I do n't smoke and I do n't drink very much .
That 's my loner .
WEZ , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media dog , people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records again .
From the conversations I have had , people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again , `` he says .
That would explain the boom to supporters of the record revivals of a certain age .
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people .
According to Wez , some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system .
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record hulls , from items that wake up happy youth memories .
`` I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation , '' says Wez .
This is the case with me as a collector and I think that 's the case with a lot of people .
It 's an easy way to engage mentally .
`` We 're like their social workers ! '' Infuriated an employee from a record stack .
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
The survey also found that 41 % own a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do n't own a record player .
At this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while blowing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data count : Three middle-aged men ) , has noticed a `` trophy aspect '' of the revival .
`` Someone only recently came in here and said , '' I do n't own a record player , but I 'd love to buy a Radiohead sound plate so I can put them on the shelf , `` he says .
This is not a large percentage , but it definitely happens .
More product-based , less music-related .
We have people who say , `` I do n't have a record player . ''
These are younger people , not older ones , who are only slowly getting in .
Fopp , which has dedicated the records to almost an entire floor , has a bungled audience when I go in .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists who take photos , teenagers and middle-aged women .
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above deals - Wild Beasts 's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drunks from the speakers - it 's good to see such diversity among customers .
None of them look very lonely , but niggling psychological traumas are hard to determine if you 're standing next to someone 30 seconds long .
Elanora , 27 , has been running around in the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of records for sale .
She is more likely to do a shop shop than a big buy .
It does n't deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It 's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... `` she drives off with a loving sigh .
I do n't know how to explain it - it 's really unique .
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : Urban Outfitters .
While I give the appearance of wearing jeans hotpants , I watch a group of young teenage girls grouped around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player .
To the left is a stairwell , a wall full of plates by Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : A mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far up , that it is impossible to touch them .
It 's pure `` record art . ''
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
It 's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates .
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are true , they do not take into account , at least in record stores in Soho , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and in online forums .
These people probably work hard at school or in offices .
They certainly do n't spend their Thursday morning strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates , while avoiding the startling look of an uncanny , 30-year-old fake presenter who towers over the shoulders of nothing suspecting middle-aged men .

Haigerloch : Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The miniseries from the watchdog Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were en route on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg .
Together , four stages have been completed .
In order to bridge the time until the next Roma pilgrimage of all miniseries in probably two years , the Oberministrantenround St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage .
Various places of pilgrimage were examined and it was finally decided for the bishop city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy with the gate of mercy at the Freiburger Münster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Minis from Bittelbronn , Gruol , Haigerloch and Heiligenrooms made their way .
On the evening before , pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimages and gave the pilgrimages .
From Horb , it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen , where there is also a Muster of Our Lady , and so the pilgrim from Münster took place .
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
But also along the way , the Minis on field crosses , chapels or churches repeatedly made roast to sing together a song from specially assembled pilgrim song booklet .
For the nights , parishes of the local parishes were available .
At the stage targets , Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast .
Further on , the second day went through furlongs to Gütenbach .
On the way to St. Peter , which was the most demanding route , they had to get off at an altitude of about 500 meters at the end of the season .
In the evening , the deserved reward was a common grilling at the Badweiher .
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , the final stage went to Freiburg .
Visibly relieved and happy , the Minis met at the Freiburger Münster later in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
With a little impulse , God was thanked here .
In the evening fair in Münster , the Minis arriving at the pilgrim 's destination were welcomed by co-operative Markus Obert .
After the service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar .
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis .
In the afternoon , it went back to Horb by train .
In the end , all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience .

The fees per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of €2.10 ; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp €3.36 ( previously $ 2.26 ) and for Azendorf €3.64 ( previously $ 2.18 ) .
At the plant in Azendorf , the sewerage fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
After an overblown calculation , the sewage price in Azendorf will then be $ 4.37 per cubic meter .
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser ( CSU ) reported , when the budget was approved by the estate agent Kulmbach , it was established that undercover was running out for these sewage plants .
On the basis of a legal basis , the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-effective manner .
From 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse .
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 per cent .
As managing director Herbert Schmidt showed up to the panel , a re-calculation of charges for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary .
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , it will also be possible to compensate for over- or undercover from the previous calculation period .
The serious fee increases were justified by the fact that all three sewage systems were relatively small , with a very low level of waste water , which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
For example , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
In addition , the volume of waste water in all three plants is declining slightly .
Furthermore , in the past calculation period , all three installations , not least because of their age , have incurred a considerable amount of recovery and repair costs .
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Welschenkahl , Neudorf and Reuth , as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage plant , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
In the pumping plant Welschenkahl , the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overtaken from scratch and , after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond , which disposed of sewage sludge and an additional ventilation facility , had to be installed in order to continue to comply with the water regulations .
Schmidt : `` To these extraordinary expenses came the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . ''
The same applies to electricity costs , which were still well below current levels in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low sewerage in the three plants , expenses for the operation and maintenance were `` fully pierced . ''
In doing so , Schmidt added , the market community has been spared major entertainment costs at sewage facilities over the past 20 years .
In the view of stone houses , the situation for these plants will remain precarious in the long term , especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Sewerage Association could not be extended to include these facilities , because they are loss-making facilities .

B27 clean-up : Restaurants suffer from lockdown
At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated , there is nothing to meckle .
For those in charge of the construction works , which start at 5.30am in the morning and only end at around 8pm , there is widespread praise .
`` They made it all pretty zacky , '' Elvira Tetzlaff told the jet petrol station .
This is a super team .
There is no delay either .
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time , until the end of October everything should be ready .
There is also praise for the accommodation of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary accommodation .
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has also been restored , the traffic situation within the site has eased .
Citizens will now be able to travel from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides .
The prevarication through the place seems to go back .
`` There have been some significant complaints about this , '' says the deputy principal investigator , Florian King , responsible for the transport-related management of the clean-up .
The residents of Bachsatzstrasse , Steinlachstraße , Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise because many snaps were looking and more familiar to their Navi than the signage .
Which led to some lorries being franked in residential areas .
Due to the fact that the speed limits were not respected , the municipality reinforced the measuring vehicle from Mössingen .
`` There were significant transgressions , '' says King , who himself was knowledgeable about the location .
Two to three per minute have already been blown up .
The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in the pace-30 zone .
Since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become calmer .
For the businessmen on the B 27 , it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg , the road is now open again .
Business people do n't like to look at the cards .
But that B 27 clean-up at them has led to sales slump , leaving anyone you ask to look through .
However , some are more and some less affected .
Those who have less to do with the `` end customer , '' that is , for other companies , for whom the clean-up has little impact .
Even at the dealership of Maier , Thomas Sulz talks of a `` maximum slight decline , '' but also acknowledges that , of course , `` the running mate is missing . ''
The most battered are the eateries along the street .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the Steakhouse , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
This is already existential .
Not only him , but all the restaurants hit it `` hard . ''
It lacked customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil .
We have to be happy about every euro turnover .
The revenue loss puts it at `` well over 50 percent . ''
Road rehabilitation has `` thrown back '' its operations `` by two years . ''
Half of his staff have had to sack him .
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been sacked , politics would have reacted differently .
Instead , government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner about whether there could be a financial compensation , saying the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the location on the B 27 Now they also have to bear the disadvantages caused by the clean-up .
Göhner knows of other counties where something more generous has been handled .
In all the lawsuits , Göhner is sure his restaurant will continue .
After all , the family business has been located here since 1715 , it refers to its long history .
That other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
If you ca n't go in , it 's nice elsewhere as well .
That his regulars come back after the end of remedial work , Göhner has no doubts about that .
Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history .
Six months of building work , that is already brutal .

Britain picks up silver in 7-yard rugby after Fiji Masterclass picks up gold
Britain 's impressive performance at 7-under rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis in the final on Thursday night , when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling , side-stepping , follow-up , line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
The defeat was sweetened by the not-so-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain 's fourth that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
The Boks ' significant defeat , 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
But regardless , Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team at best in this form .
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably wo n't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow : Fijian 's head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind .
Eight years ago , they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens .
Here , they lost only one .
This setback will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started miraculously and allowed the attacks to hit GBs out of fun .
It felt for the captain , Tom Mitchell , and co , as if running into moving buses ... the World Series winners went 5-0 up when osea Kolinisau ran out in the corner .
With still four minutes of game time , Jerry Tuwai added yet another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball .
A howling Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fiji .
In the seventh minute , JASA Veremalua leaped a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of game time ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou prepped through more weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal .
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break .
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning .
So it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Fijian gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant interim play by Fiji .
Dan Norton started a try for GB , making a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 , but the game went on for a long time in favour of the South Seas , whose fans sang , flags waved and danced in the public gallery .
It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis .
Mata Viliame set up the i-bag with another try in the final seconds .
The pantomime sounded , the Fijis embraced and GB kickstarted damning beaten into the turf .
Earlier in the day , Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-finals at 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Britain 's conversion of the difference .
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half .
A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .

Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government 's reforms to the public education system .
Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse students , resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas .
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans .
According to proposals from the governor of the federal state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , slightly fewer than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money .
Some of the protest participants saw graffitits against interim President Michel Temer spraying on walls .
The recent protests occurred a few days after protesters took to the streets in crowds to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff , who had been removed from office by a Senate vote on her dismissal .

CBC commentator for the Olympics apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer `` died like a pig ''
Byron MacDonald 's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-form swimming squadron outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypal Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer `` went off like tenants '' and during the race like `` a pig died . ''
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was switched off when he cast his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-form swimming squadron .
Macdonald , who had been picked to the commentary team of the CBS on board to lend more `` color , '' could be heard saying : `` This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection , baby . ''
Too excited , went off like Mief , died like a pig .
Thank you for that .
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan , 14 , swam the second leg of the swimming squadron 1 : 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada 's Taylor Ruck , which allowed Canadians to close the gap with China .
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted , `` Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China '' died like a pig `` ? ? ? ?
The idiot has n't captioned that they were still on show . '
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-form swimming squadron for women : `` This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection , baby . ''
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard , with many asking him to speak
Twitter users did n't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote : `` WoW , # ByronMacDonald .
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists . # angeekelt .
A short time later , Scott Russel , who moderated the CBC broadcast , apologised live for MacDonald 's comment and said : `` We apologise that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . ''
It was an unfortunate chosen phrase , we 're sorry it happened . '
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times among the people who responded to the notices on Twitter
The commentator 's colleague Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC coped and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald 's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message .
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
We quickly apologised to our viewers on show and our followers on social media last night .
To make one thing clear , Byron 's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person .
However , they were inappropriate and an ill-chosen wording , and Byron is very sorry for what he has said .
On Thursday afternoon , MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention for it to be interpreted as a personal attack .
`` I 'd like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women 's swimming staffer in the CBC Olympian , he said .
'i was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person . '
Of course , no disregard was intended and I 'm very sorry . '

Military leaders falsify ISIS intelligence information , notes committee of Congress
Military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground , an investigative committee of Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
The preliminary report , created by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Services Committee , Secret Service commenters and the conscientious objector , reported huge dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how precincts changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against Islamic State .
The Central Command , short Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` Intelligence information typically gendered by senior CENTCOM commanders regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , '' a newspaper article quoted the report as saying .
`` What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , '' Ken Calvert , Republican member of the House of Representatives , noted .
The leadership flaws in CENTCOM extend to the top top of the organization .
The 10-page report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` During the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts , '' the report noted .
For example , a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin as early as April or May 2015 .
Mosul , Iraq 's second-largest city , remains under the control of Islamic State .
`` After months of investigation , so much is clear , '' Mike Pompeo , Republican congressman from Kansas , said in a statement .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq .
Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
The report , published on Thursday , will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
In addition , further investigation of the CENTCOM reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence is underway .
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday , which agreed with some of the Republican task force 's conclusions .
`` In 2014 and 2015 , CENTCOM created an overly restricted process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services , '' the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee , member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement .
That process , Mr. Schiff said , `` delayed the publication of intelligence reports , '' damaging the morale among analysts and `` gave overly little room for dissent . ''
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of an intervention by the White House at the CENTCOM analysts regarding a `` certain political opinion . ''
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast .
Last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon 's inspector general , which was recorded following complaints from CENTCOM analysts .
Lt. Cmdr . Patrick Evans , a press officer at the Pentagon , admitted in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on any reports from Congress , while the inspector general 's investigation is still underway .
But he also admitted that `` experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . ''
The investigation has repercussions beyond the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
However , last year 's accusations have raised questions about how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than a decade ago , when a CENTCOM analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , provided only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State .
Last year , the team around Mr. Hooker notes , according to government agencies , that contrary to the government 's statements , air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group , as these temporary refineries would have been in operation to sell oil on the black market .
However , that finding was not released , the Times reported in September .
Centcom 's then-commander , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with coach 's cancer to rowing win
There will be no emotinal gold than in these games and that 's what you want to say .
From the first rowing strike to the last , 220 hard Hieve that go down in history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa .
Even though it was only the inmate who sat at the helm , there were three votes in the boat ; the echo of the coach , Robin Williams , was all-present as they were rumoured to be the second Olympian in the second without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport to set such a scale .
Their dominance was absolutely , after all , her 39th undefeated effort , which is also unprecedented .
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not fully reflect the kind of triumph .
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers , contributing to the incremental advances that make up the difference and there was no one more bemused than the coach who , 30 months ago , did n't know if he would survive that day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
As he said , he was risky .
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did .
If you do n't , it spreads everywhere .
It would have been a pretty dire situation .
It changes a little of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio were lucky that he could begin treatment in early 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 foot , 30 foot , 50 foot at a time when they said that some steps would suffice .
That 's how it starts .
Rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
In the immediacy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve-wracking morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
Stanning , who was a principal in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said `` I was an emotional wreck this week ... that might be something extreme , but it means so much . ''
It just repeats how much it means to me , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked .
It 's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him ... he 's the best coach in the world .
I could n't have wanted a better person to exercise or a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years .
The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
Even in the last 500 metres , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to shut up , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were very caught at the moment .
Helen cried `` stay in the process , stay in the process . ''
It 's really important not to get involved .
We had a good start and at the same time we were n't looking to make some tolles .
We did n't want fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
The pair will take a break for a year before it will make decisions about his future .
Glover must appear at a wedding next week , her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall .
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did n't want to say that this was my last race .
That would have meant too much pressure .
In London , it took around six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
Here it took about four minutes .
That feels so much better , `` she said .

Scot Callum Skinner stormed home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men 's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had embraced , making the legend proud when he stormed home to take home a win from the favourites New Zealand .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals .
They repeated the trick after catching only a modest sixth in March at the rail world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the recruit Jamie Staff .
They did so in time as Hindes appeared .
Hoy 's retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots , which has now unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Zealanders won in the first round .
And the British trio won the duel with gold .
Hindes fell short after his round , but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it .
A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation , in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny , and especially Skinner , to keep pace .
Hoy looked on from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner , Kenny and Hindes when these rose to the podium .
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said : `` It 's a flattering comparison . ''
I 'm only here to do my best and make a name for myself .
We set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions .
It was just unbelievable .
There is no better way to win .
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys , Hindes admitted that he intentionally fell on the train after a poor start .
He later withdrew that statement and there was no appeal from England 's rivals .
In such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time .
Hindes said : `` It feels with all the GB flags in the gallery like London . ''
We 've come together as a team in the last three months .
We got away so badly at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
This is an event , a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velodrome .
With the form of Kennys , it is in the realm of the possible that he repeats Hoy 's win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently sacred date for British sport ; on the day , Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the same from Hoy .
Kenny takes next in the sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said : `` I 'm just enjoying this for the moment . ''
The team event is always best .
You can win it with his colleagues .
It feels somewhat lonely to win on its own .
Hindes said : `` If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the knight . ''
It was the only medal contest of the day , but there was more good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-game four-kilometre race .
They came in 3 : 51,942 on goal .
The world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 51,659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where Wiggins will certainly be the focus .
He had been arguing with envoy before qualifying yesterday when officials called on him to measure his body size .
In the corresponding women 's competition , which will continue and end tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4 : 13,260 .
The GB team is relying on its strong rail cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a chunk of medals .
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down .
It played drama in the background , according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexting and bullying allegations , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
However , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom , it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .

Who is building Braunschweig 's cheap apartments ?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be given much greater responsibility in the future .
How do you respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 affordable homes over the next few years ?
The SPD proposes a `` concept of living '' at the next Council meeting .
But controversy is programmed .
First and foremost , the question is : Who should actually build the affordable housing ?
There is no regulation so far .
Obama group chairman Christoph Bratman thinks : `` We agree with the Greens : If you want to build on urban land , in the future , 20 per cent of all apartments will have to be designated as social housing . ''
However , the affordable apartments can also be found in the stock .
However , the big talking point at City Hall is , according to Bratman : `` How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? ''
'We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such land , but as much as 20 per cent of homes as social housing . '
A new urban housing support scheme , which will cost millions and still needs to be funded , is designed to provide incentives .
The problem , according to Bratman : `` There is still no agreement between the groups at the moment . ''
The CDU wants to give investors as few rules as possible .
The left still wants tougher requirements for investors .
Despite this , according to Bratman , there is a tightening of the situation in the housing market .
If the concept of action is implemented , this will provide for additional tasks in the building administration .
More staff will be needed .
It 's unclear whether we will get the professionals .
But the programme is not yet complete : The approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
But how do you compare the loss of another about 1300 affordable housing , the promotion of which will be phased out over the next few years ?
There will be 500 homes by 2020 alone .
To prevent this from happening , according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm , now expiring ties should be bought from the city .
In addition , consideration would have to be given to bringing housing back into price fixing .
This is possible in the western city .
At one stroke , the problem could be solved .
Because in the western city , deadlines expire at the end of the year .
Some 1800 apartments could be brought back there in price fixing for affordable housing .
Only : That 's what the owners want , the housing associations do n't .
Because , once again , the number of social housing in the western city will be dramatically increased , away from the goal of so-called mixing .
A concentration of social weak in just a few neighbourhoods should no longer exist .
The Greens reckon there will still be movement in the discussion .
Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke says : `` For a broad majority , the CDU must be on board . ''
The has focused on more building sites for single-family homes .
But that does not mean that a compromise can not be found .

Once pushed over the price from the market , cafe comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi-Fi , but served 15 years of good coffee .
Of course , prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue shopfront .
The business Soap Cherie , which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cupcakes .
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city .
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , `` I know New York is change , but I still ca n't believe that CBGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exempt and verb is now a soap business . ''
But if New York is change , it 's also reinvention .
A revitalised Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint , less than a mile north of its original location .
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
The coffee is still good .
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a longtime employee of the old cafe , who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
When he offered a customer to provide funds for a new outsider , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , maintained a lot of things .
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
He introduced new ingredients .
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and saucy onions .
There are natural rice bowls .
The café does n't serve beer , there are fresh juices for that .
After nine months , Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
`` A lot of old customers were also pushed out by prices from Williamsburg , '' he said .
Recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer .
Oliveira , 34 , used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
Even after she moved to Greenpoint , she would take the path .
After the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drink for a while , she said .
`` It became clear to me that it was on the coffee and on the culture in the verb that I liked , '' she said .
Now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a Blended Chai Tea that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003 .
He went there before work and invariably ordered the same .
`` I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything-bagel with butter , '' he said .
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
Nowadays , Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything-bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he had no grudge about the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
In fact , the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cafe 's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient .
`` I think we 're still going to go on their offer , '' Rodriguez said .
And the traditional , Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe .
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he pretends to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
The location also has other benefits .
A local juice local would like to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee .
There 's a chance the cafe is expanding to a neighbouring building .
For many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favourites .
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
When the new cafe opened , Whitt said that entering the site and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home .
`` I had to smell that , '' he said .

Witnesses sought : Drink market invaded in forest broil
A robbery has been carried out on the drinks market of Rewe XXL at Waldbröler Gerberstraße on Thursday night .
Under preoccupation of a firearm , three dark-clad people who had conjoined their faces demanded the release of cash from the employee of the drinks market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW Golf .
How much money was extracted is not shared by the police .
The perpetrators are believed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 feet tall , so relatively small .
The beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market .
After the raid in the direction of Gerberstraße , Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg , the perpetrators must have fled from the car park opposite the car park entrance with the silver-coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schladernring ) .
Anyone who made observations at the time of the offence ( at around 7.45pm ) , which is in connection with the robbery , is expected to report to police as a matter of urgency .

Heavy rains , flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana , Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday , with more rain expected throughout Saturday .
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisianas and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with widespread flooding after extreme rains , the National Weather Service reported .
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards told reporters that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid to the affected communities is already on the way .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the governor 's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , told reporters that requests for flood vehicles , boats and sandbags increased .
Steele said that alone the community of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sandbags .
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisianas through Saturday .
The weather service reported that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in that area .
A flood alert system was used in southern Alabamas on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
The metereologist Alek Krautman says that both rivers could flood many homes in suburban neighborhoods near Baton Rouge .
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger , as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas across the rivers .
The River Tickfaw , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday .
Rescue teams still added people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and his stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday .
Hansford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet from his home , rose sharply overnight .
He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him .
`` We woke up and the water poured in and poured in , '' Hansford said .
It reached my waist .
His wife told Hansford that she 'd never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hansford said that he and his family members all had disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hansford said that Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and had taken them to the next fire station in Gloster , where they were housed until Friday .
Krautman said that the exuberance had `` spread quickly '' as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions .
According to Krautman , an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain .
Krautman said that the ground was considerably full-blown by the rains since Wednesday .
Authorities said that heavy rainfall and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching failure in five school districts .
CBS affiliate WWL reported that an inmate in Tangipahoa gave birth to 200 flooded homes .
Residents were evacuated to two churches , which have now both been inundated .
The foreman of the community of Robby Miller said that authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who were washed up by the flooding .
Shelters have been set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees .
`` Once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , '' he said .
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa , nearly two dozens of roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags provided for residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops .
`` The last major flooding we had was in March , '' said Lacy Landrum of the City Council .
This appears to be a similar incident .
In Mississipp , emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
According to his data , a handful of homes are believed to have been reported as inundated on Thursday , but on Friday , none have been reported until now .
Keith Townson , manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has already lived in the area for 40 years .
`` I 've seen water in places where I 've never seen it before , '' Townson said , `` and it 's still coming . ''

Intercultural travel : Cultural offers for schools
The international class of forest school attended the play `` The invisible house . ''
The club NIMA 's and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
The association NIMA 's enables young people with an immigrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
The `` Class International '' of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a presentation of the award-winning play `` The invisible house '' of the Young Theater Münster .
In the context of the `` intercultural journey '' initiated by the association NIMA 's , 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the staging at the Little House .
Since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with an immigrant and refugee background , has been offering schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
Most young people in the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little English .
Thanks to the choreographies , the Shakespearean images and video animations , they were able to follow the course of action , according to the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
The association NIMA 's , founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project .
From October to December , young people with and without an escape and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
The `` Intercultural Travel '' project continues .
Given the increased numbers of refugees , the association is counting on many classes that want to participate .

The £2-per-day drug that can cut heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug after it was recommended by authorities to administer this more people for an extended period of time .
The clotting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
The NHS 's regulator NICE has recommended a four year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
The NHS 's regulator NICE has recommended a four year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke .
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fetal material in the arterial walls that form bellies .
When the filler breaks apart , it can cause a blood clotting that clogs the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
When the blood clots dissolves , it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of another .
Ticagrelor , which is manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique , reduces that risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely .
NICE 's draft pick , published today , recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said : `` Despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . ''
Fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
Experience shows that Ticagrelor , in combination with aspirin , is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .

Group rises at start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people playing video games is a huge thing - that 's what Microsoft wants to benefit from .
The technology giant is buying the start-up Beam , which specialises in this hobby .
How much money is flowing for the takeover , Microsoft did not disclose on Thursday .
Beam only went to the start with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
You can watch others while playing , but also intervene yourself .
For example , they can give up missions and confront enemies as well as provide equipment .
Gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports .
On the way to the global media event , Facebook is expected to help .
The advertising industry is already hovering .
Staff at the start-up , which has its headquarters so far in Seattle in the D.C. area , are moving to Microsoft headquarters in California 's Redmond , according to Beam co-founder and chief executive Matt Salsamendi .
As a result , the transaction will not change for customers .
Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console , according to Microsoft .
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly .
Well-known platforms are twitch and YouTube gaming .
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for nearly $ 1 billion .
YouTube Gaming is part of Google 's mother Alphabet .

Still , Volkswagen is coming through lightly .
Despite the diesel scandal , delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
But not in all markets it runs around .
During the recall , there is buzz around a term .
Volkswagen will start operating in the second half of the year at the time of deliveries .
In spite of its many brands and some well-run markets , Europe 's biggest automaker continues to be a plus , despite its many brands and some well-run markets .
But in July , the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and again impacted overall sales , according to the company listed in the Dax .
Globally , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449100 cars than the same month last year .
In Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the same month last year .
In the home market of Germany , deliveries plummeted by almost a sixth .
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July in particular to two sales days less in Europe .
In addition , there has been a buy-back in some core markets through `` changing economic conditions . ''
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the UK voted to leave the EU , a spokeswoman explained .
In the US , where the exhaust fumes first escalated , a low is also on the rise .
Big support for VW is the Chinese market .
Overall , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is in any case further benign due to the diesel scandal : After the first seven months , there is only an delivery minus 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles .
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to provide a sales boost from January to July .
1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen in that time , worldwide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had been rigged with a software exhaust test .
In Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops .
As part of the conversion , VW reiterated that the revamp of the cars did not have a negative impact .
After the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
The automaker is issuing a `` guarantee '' certificate to customers after the conversion , but does not speak of a `` guarantee '' as it was in corporate travel on Friday .
The reason is legal niceties .
The `` Focus '' reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for revamped diesel models .
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Department of Transportation last Monday .
It was confirmed by the Department for Transport that there was this meeting .
`` VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and KBA . ''
`` Deviations from this are not accepted , '' Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) declared , according to the ministry .
VW has accepted the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion and that all type-approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term `` guarantee '' as it was in corporate travel .
Under the broad term `` guarantee , '' Volkswagen sees the possibility that , for example , customers may come to a workshop six months after conversion , for example , with an engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
In the interests of the customer , it is also important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the abortion scandal , will lead to uncertainty as to possible guarantee schemes , as has been said .
That is why VW does not use the term `` guarantee . ''

Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid , leader of Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court .
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland 's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge on Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia .
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland `` with a degree of certainty . ''
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating .
He praised Garland and said Clinton 's team would not cause unrest with a new candidate .
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. appellate court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republicans who blocked Garland 's nomination are Lakers and heroines of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
He also noted that Donald Trump is unsuitable for president .

French court rejects bid over demolition of shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by authorities in Calais to break down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live .
At a court hearing this week , authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to bring down 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offering hairdressing services or selling tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and sanitation risk .
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
They also said that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional deals , but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were `` absolutely understandable . ''
The judge , Jean-François Molla , said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who `` live in extremely precarious conditions . ''
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places threatened by the low-rise was the Jungle Book Kids ' Café of the Camp , which is operated by the public and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors in the camp .
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids ' cafe .
In a letter to the Guardian , it said that the closure `` would be a disaster for these children , the youngest of whom are eight years old . ''
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer .

Assistant doctors strike : Calls for new labour force action
Deputy assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour force measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
The Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has called on its entire council to approve more labour force measures from early September .
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract .
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA .
It was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained `` persistently quiet '' to problems , which led to the contract being rejected .
She said : `` In light of this , the JDC board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns . ''
In response to the government 's silence , the JDC board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor force action , which begins in early September .
The disputes resulted in assistant doctors striking six times this year , the first total cancellations in the history of the NHS .
The head of BMA assistant doctors Dr Johann Malawana stepped down after the election to reject the agreed contract terms that had been recommended by the BMA .
He told BMA members during the meetings , which took place even before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
After the vote , the Health Secretary , Jeremy Hunt , said that the contract would be forcibly introduced for doctors in England .

Russia and Turkey : An `` alliance of outsiders '' ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions .
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can not deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
There was the handshake , yes .
But Putin 's smile seemed shaky and he was barely radiating heat , even for his restrained conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his `` dear friend '' Putin - according to a report full five times .
I could n't count it anymore .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis , but will even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if anything bad had never happened .
To me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
But a sustainable boldness demonstrated by Putin showed that the leader of Russia had forgotten nothing .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : The firing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was wrenching .
Putin told and accused Ankara of dropping Russia in the back .
The offence was even greater as it was committed by a would-be friend .
Rebuilding the vetoes will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , the state-controlled media conducted a fierce , unrestricted attack on Ankara .
At one time , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
Most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan 's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State .
He has vehemently denied this .
But in St.Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to win some sort of victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire are clear .
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost stripped of his office last month in a failed coup .
Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
The number has decreased by almost 90 % .
In Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume .
They count on a late-seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
This week , state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
As a report in Vedemosti put it : `` Tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had added political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it views its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response .
This is followed by persistent resentment over the snail 's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey 's relationship with the West .
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for elected state bodies after the attempted coup .
This is , of course , a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change .
The summit in this lacklustre palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray one , as one analyst once described to me , `` Alliance of outsiders '' : Two countries that are in breach of the West and feel ill-treated and are now allied .
Nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both presidents testified at the news conference that they had n't even leveled the issue .
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize it .
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found .
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other again .

England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London , but across the country .
For me , this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows , just as it was back in 2012 in London , when we ran a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the Games .
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End .
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow .
For our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
Just as they were ahead of us at London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlarging Heathrows is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage .
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcome , but Heathrow answers every question put to him .
Like the Olympics , Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individual .
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £211 billion in weather-related growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB .
We have a great team at Heathrow , which has implemented a £11bn expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row to become the world 's best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the midst of the world 's two busiest catwalks .
Now they are poised to deliver a third catwalk , which is supported by £16 billion in private investment .
The 2012 London Games have been a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .
Lord Paul Dwarton is chairman of the Heathrow board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury

One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and all-consuming
In the small HR-V , Honda wants to pack everything : A little SUV , a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan .
Sounds quite overloaded , but the HR-V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
Although the only 1.60m high HR-V looks rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear , it does n't work closely at any point .
The materials of the interior are well-processed and look pleasant , only the cockpit top falls slightly .
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage space .
It 's not just a trunk of 453 l at high-placed and 1026 l at overturned backrests available , but there 's the `` Magic Seats . ''
This is less magical than it sounds : The backbench seats can be folded up like cinema chairs , offering storage space that is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceilings .
The boot is well loaded , but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in a wide speed range .
However , he is likely to do his job a little more quietly .
Pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
There is another engine : A 1.5-litre petrol with 96 kW / 130 hp .
A four-wheel drive is not offered .
Driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamism and comfort .
However , the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant `` Executive . ''
The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the track assistant .
The collision warner sometimes irritates because , at Rangers , he assesses many obstacles as `` approaching objects . ''
The remote light assistant works very reliably .
And the smart speed regulator responds to traffic character recognition and throttles speed when needed .
However , full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7-inch touchscreen , Navi , app integration and more .
Two USB and an HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach .
The roughly $ 29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel is fine .
Those who do n't want to invest so much will receive the petrol from £20000 , the diesel from £23,000 .
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard .
With the HR-V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .

Assistant doctors want to organise more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt 's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him .
In July , Hunt unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be in a `` no-man 's land '' and that any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients .
The first assistant doctors are to be given a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the chair of the BMA committee for assistant doctors told reporters last night in a statement : `` Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly . ''
At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out .
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with the government 's reluctance to participate , and sometimes on deafening silence .
This was the result of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open .
'Jeremy Hunt must act now , lift the imposition and address the concerns of assistant doctors . '
If he fails to do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further industrial action .
The latest strike in late April saw a reprieve of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nurses and specialist doctors were included to provide cover to doctors on the strike pot chain .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
The BMA wants a better weekly wage for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , director general of NHS staff , urged assistant doctors to end the strike .
Mr Mortimer said : `` Labour force measures do not achieve any of the little , but already charge over-burdened teams and service providers , and prepare patients , nurses and their families only to worry , distress and interruption . ''
Over the past two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistant doctors and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Department of Health and other ministries .
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other major issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from a professional timeout , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , Health Education England and the Department of Health were about complying with the agreements with the BMA in November , February and May .

Seriously injured - man stabbed on his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked and seriously injured his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife .
As police announced yesterday , the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
Instead , the alcohol-fuelled offender cut off his ex-girlfriend 's clothes .
When this came into the apartment , he stole twice on her .
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body .
Police were able to arrest the perpetrator .
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend 's clothes , he called his mother .
This then alerted his sister .
Together with her partner , the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother .
But she was unable to persuade him to leave the flat .
That 's why she walked out of the house with her partner .
On the street , they met the man 's ex-partner .
When the two women entered the apartment again , the 50-year-old snubbed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend .

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
Thus , in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and firms from London .
`` It 's very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote , '' says Michael Voigtlands , head of the IW 's competence field and property markets .
After the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether financial institutions will be allowed to continue to operate from London from financial operations across the EU .
For the so-called EU passport , they have so far been granted authorisation in the UK .
That 's just using big U.S. banks .
Several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs .
The lobby association `` Frankfurt Main Finance '' expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
For Frankfurt , according to the IW , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the eurozone 's largest banks , as well as other key authorities such as the European insurance watchdog EIOPA and the Risk Board of ESRB .
In Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial industry than the ECB .
`` The proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate so directly with supervision , '' says IW professor Voigtlands .
Luxembourg has a large fund industry , but , like Dublin , it is worse off when it comes to infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
In addition , the city has easily accessible commercial real estate .
`` In Paris , it 's not so easy to find free high-quality offices , '' Voigtlands says .
In addition , on the Seine , rents for first-class commercial real estate are 50 per cent higher than on the main .
In addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good health care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
In a ranking of consultancy Mercer , the city stands at number seven , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 37th place .
Even though quality of life is a matter of preferences : `` With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , '' the IW concludes .
London , however , will remain the main financial centre in Europe despite the Brexit vote , the economic researchers say .
There is also the balance of power : In London , according to figures from Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015 , some 144,000 people worked in the banking sector , and in Frankfurt there were 62500 .

More than just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue .
Kendall , who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday .
`` In a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to the wines , '' Kendall wrote .
The revelation of the cover-up was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar ? ) , scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the much-loved showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) as they have forgotten the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic twist : They have all planned a surprise party .
This represents the cliched plot of almost every birthday episode of a children 's show ( Seacrest brought the phrase , `` You thought that we would have forgotten you ? , '' with the honesty of a cartoon canine on a broadcast slot at 8 in the morning ) , but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity .
With regards to the September issue of Vogue , certainly a new era of the Kardashians has begun .
Kendall 's big sister , Kim , may have beaten her in terms of the Vogue cover ( she and her husband Kanye West were seen on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
The September issue is the most selling edition of the year for Vogue .
With a scope more akin to a picture band than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 's 615 pages advertising ) .
The unveiling of his cocoon is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years , images of the magazine were leaked even before the official announcement .
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In recent years , there have clearly been more `` celebrities who are mocking '' as `` models that are famous '' on the cover .
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady Gaga had the honour .
But even at the low chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the `` breakthrough model '' of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video ( even if it all applies to Jenner ) .
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the final cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade .
Of course , Jenner 's success does n't please everyone .
With her reality TV history , Jenner 's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat fraught .
In June , incoming Victoria 's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called them `` the mistpieces of the moment . ''
Those feelings boiled over again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover .
But riding on the resentment seems to be at the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue .
She is literally a supermodel .
She runs for Marc Jacobs .
She makes adverts for your primer of Estee Lauder .
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps .
She sells from her made images of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to the magazine LOVE .
And in her spare time she is seen on reality TV , presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children .

Steel - bright spot for German steel industry
The crisis-battered and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared an additional cost of millions of dollars .
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from oil production are off the table .
It remains with the exemption from the renewable-energy levy at the inventory facilities to so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry , Federal Industry Minister Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung ( WAZ , Friday edition ) .
`` I am really pleased that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . ''
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gases from the blast furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption .
The steel industry threatened additional costs of $ 120 to $ 240 million a year , according to the German Industry Association .
Gabriel told WAtoday there was now a landmark agreement with the European Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steel works that an EEG-surcharge of 20 per cent falls .
But this , too , is not raised in the steel industry .
The IG welcomed Germany 's agreement with the EU Commission on self-energy production .
This largely enshrines the status quo of the current regime .
Gabriel 's successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
'in terms of our campaign 'steel is future ' this is a first step . '
`` More must follow . ''
`` There are also climate and employment objectives to be weighed up in the reform of the emissions trading scheme , '' said IG 's chief executive Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
Last year , the situation worsened further as the world 's largest producer country , China , threw mass steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand .
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping .
Over the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat .
On the one hand , import tariffs imposed on imports have an impact , and the economic outlook in China has brightened .
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday .
Most recently , prices have tended to stagnate .
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
At the same time , ThyssenKrupp did not want to rule out the closure of individual works .
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
In July , German steelmakers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
They produced a good six per cent less crude steel at 3.4 million tonnes than in the same month last year , according to the Business Association of Steel on Friday .
After a brief increase in May , the produced crowd now went back the second month in a row .
Since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year .
The association expects rising emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .

The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers to pay punitive interest rates in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
Bank chief executive Josef Paul said on Thursday : `` It 's only about 139 customers who park $ 40 million on current or day money accounts . ''
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an isolated case and does not see it as a signal : Ordinary savers `` should not be afraid to pay for their asparagus penalty rates . ''
Store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 per cent penalty rate .
This fee requires Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over $ 100,000 on current or daily money accounts .
'the first £100,000 is free . '
`` The next 100,000 will cost $ 400 a year in the future , '' Paul said .
He has been wary of £40 million for some time , which could be relegated from one day to the other and which he could not exploit .
`` Those lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , '' the bank chief said .
'i ca n't put down for every £4,000 . '
In accordance with the 'polluter pays ' principle , the costs will now continue .
Leaving the cash simply in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous : `` I 've already experienced four overs , I do n't like the fifth ! '' The bank chairman said .
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment .
Few migrated to other banks .
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria stated : `` The ECB 's extreme monetary policy rate is causing significant costs for all banks . ''
Carrying it alone is `` economically not possible on a permanent basis . ''
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or credit transfers .
With punitive interest rates on deposits starting at $ 3 million , the Thurston People 's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kemmer , chief executive of the Banking Association , said : `` We do not expect retail customers to have to pay blanket fees for deposits , so competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong . ''
One banker said that at Tegernsee there is `` a clientele that is a little more exuberant by the wealth . ''
`` This can become a problem for a small bank '' if it hunted for free money .
The cooperative bank Gmund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach-Ewen , Kreuth and Tegernsee .
Well-known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria `` is not currently aware of any other banks that charge an outlet rate for deposits from retail customers , '' spokesman earnest said .
The President of the Federal Association of German People 's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken ( BVR ) , Uwe Fröhlich , said at the end of June : `` The threshold of going negative towards the private customer is very , very high . ''
The competition is tough , and it is threatening the exodus of investors to the competition .
Customers in Germany wo n't like that in width .

Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the refund of the legal costs incurred by her from the Hepatits C legal battle with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc .
In June , Gilead was freed from a $ 200 million compensation payment for the violation of two patents by Merck , which was related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of Mercks , including the Meineides and other unethical acts .
In collecting the lawsuit on Thursday , U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to enactment of the costs incurred while defending the case .
Merck is trying to equalise with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
The case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Merck sued each other and took ownership of laboratory work involving Sofosbuvir , the active ingredient in Gilead 's drugs .

Rescue in Moelfre Bay : Three men have `` good luck still to be alive ''
Three men are `` lucky to still be alive '' after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey .
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay .
The three men had difficulty swimming to safety while their boat moved on on their own .
`` We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and confronted us the worst , '' the head of Moelfre Vince Jones ' rescue station said .
`` Fortunately , the strong winds have already waved the boat out of their reach until we left to water , '' he added .
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat , while the third man , aged 60 , was exhausted and found at a Boje hanging without a rescue vest .
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said : `` The three men thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive .
The boat engine had an emergency stopper , but the boat was removed by the person who was driving the boat .
Someone was waking up about these men today .

Tourists in Portugal panicked after a tieffing military jet flies over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese-based P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force put down an incredible storm flight
The Air Force said that it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
This was the moment terrified tourists start to panic after a tipped jet crashed over a full beach .
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity over the sun 's ankles on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal .
Holidaymakers sped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming through the clouds on them .
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media , said : `` It flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash . ''
Nuno Arroja added : `` I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . ''
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
The spokesman said that due to poor visibility , the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility , however the Air Force insisted that security was at no time at risk .
Wildfires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , which also killed four people on the island of Madeira .
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

The depressing food of the economic crisis in `` a plentiful meal ''
In March 1933 , shortly after his rise to president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
As a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup .
His menu that day was slightly more modest : Stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato puree and as dessert a plum pudding .
`` It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , '' Jane Ziegelman said .
Her husband , Andrew Coe , added , `` It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat . ''
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coes 's last book `` Chop Suey '' acted from Chinese cuisine in the United States , while brick was told in her book `` 97 Orchard '' about life in a residence on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
Her latest collaboration , `` A decent meal , '' which will appear at Harper Publishing on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg 's Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , sniffing snack in the Flatiron District , which has already been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Brick man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Coe , 57 , ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered pecking , this found the pair fit for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
`` Rich food was very popular , '' Ziegelman said .
There was groundnut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap , stretching the ingredient .
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner .
Coe grinned .
`` It must have laid in the stomach like lead , '' he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table was an All-You-Can-Eat buffet in an American household , especially in rural areas .
Crews of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastes for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War .
`` It was a time when food became a central , tense topic for Americans , '' Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
Just as tense was the new budget diet : Mysterious dishes such as brows and casseroles became staple foods , the casserole as a `` wonderful way to reuse food leftovers , '' brick man noted , as chefs were able to hide unsavoury ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
Meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rarely serrated luxury .
Strange blends have been tried , as calorie-rich and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even healthy cooking .
During her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with peanut butter , too .
`` It was n't a popular addition at lunchtime , '' Coe says .
Brickman continues : `` It was surreal . ''
Peanut butter and baked onions do n't match each other .
It was typical of many of the home business recipes .
Like never before or since , budget economists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - drove the country 's eating habits in such a way .
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become `` household politicians '' and to live up to the challenge of turning pep like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
`` A Square Meal '' is a celebration of historical delicacies .
Particularly palatable are the reports of the government 's response to starving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoover 's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude .
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he fed up like the billionaire man of world to whom he has become .
`` He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce , '' Coe said .
He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room and wore a smoker .
He was delightfully out of touch with reality .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife , Eleanor , had asked him to set an example with his stomach .
As described in the book , the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most defiant. ``
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , dealing with food , was discarded once the country got back on its feet .
The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Ziegelman said , as well as on how science was applied to food .
The pair admitted to the book 's writing to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman 's mother-in-law - for example , how she could n't throw away food .
`` She had a real fear of wasting food , '' Coe said .
Ziegelman recalled : `` She was actually making people sick . ''
There was the windbag incident .
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg 's , she and Coe drew a dessert they had prepared at home : The plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at noon .
`` It 's called Prune Whip , '' Ziegelman said , adding that it was a nasty trick to miss humble recipes a chic name .
There was no beaten cream , just plums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Everyone appeared somewhat reluctant to put a spoon in the taller , brown glibber .
Amazingly , it did n't look bad .
CoE picked up an aftershock three times .
Like a Can-Do budget maker , he said to his wife , `` A few chopped walnuts would help . ''

Old buildings , a few lime trees , some remaining cobblestones in between : The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like it at first glance , but the police rank them among the `` dangerous places '' of the city .
Walking down the road from east to west , you arrive at playgrounds , a fresh-coated nursery and a biolade .
On the facade of a grey house , someone sprayed `` ugly ! ''
Opposite a Lidl , which is also soon to be demolished , is already being built : By 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be created here .
However , articles about this `` trendy neighborhood , '' as the relevant real estate firm Friedrichshain calls it , are preferred with burning cars in recent weeks .
The reason is the house with the number 94 : Once it was occupied , the residents now have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
In particular , Berlin interior senator Henkel had argued several times since the beginning of the year for a crackdown by police against the project , describing the area as a `` no-go zone '' for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
After , on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kadtermiths , with 300 police officers had been cleared , police patrolled three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on the ground , closed parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
Meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners .
On July 13 , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents .
On this summer afternoon , the street looks peaceful : Parents walk with children , people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun , while others entertain prep spenders .
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens .
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in Kiev since 1999 , and Jana * , who is raising three children here , are mainly terrified by the police presence .
With the residents of the house projects , they share concerns about rising rents and gentrification .
It does not sound like a Kiev , the majority of whom wanted police protection from vandalizing left .
The ditch that the Berlin interior senator and police make up between housemates and their neighbours does not appear to exist .
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district , which even today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city .
In 1990 a large number of houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main Street in the vicinity of the Rigaer .
While the mainstays had been cleared under a large police lineup in an outright street battle , many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
At the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world in recent years .
This is also noticeable in rents , which have risen by nearly 60 per cent since 2009 in new rentals .
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development : They can be seen on discarded windows or freshly painted facades , which have been pelted with paint bags .
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words `` left-wing autonomous violence . ''
One reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : Crimes such as injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively against police officers .
Most of the crimes make property damage , which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated homes .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
As for acts of violence , it is appeasement : The people in the 94 are their neighbours , who certainly were not .
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer any longer .
For the studied architect , their street is not a criminal flashpoint , on the contrary : `` Here you help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . ''
Neugebauer is deliberately drawn to Rigaer Street - and stayed .
That 's why it was so important to her that residents get their street back : From the police , the politics and the media , who in July all suddenly claimed the interpretive power over the district .
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer , the road will continue to be taken away from them : Through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that outnumber the old residents .
`` These are , after all , condominiums that are not interesting to many here - here are more people who are not so well-behaved , '' she says .
`` I absolutely do not approve of violence and destruction . ''
But what should you do if someone never listens to anyone ?
There is frustration on all sides , including the police and residents .
For Zudrew , who is annoyed by color bombs , Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding : The house projects and the left-wing scene were part of the Kiez .
If you 're coming in , you should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there .
All people presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their real name

Community , spirit , health : Singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life : As a young girl she was in the school choir , in Lehramt studies she finished the subject of music , and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir .
`` Singing moves me - emotionally and physically , '' she describes .
After a sample , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more vibrant , she says .
By the way , she is doing something good for her health and her mind .
Because singing is equally from multiple perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League .
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music , describes Hackler .
Through regular gathering , seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts .
Because often social and family structures are solved in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir : `` To talk down and organize , to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness . ''
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense , Hackler suggests .
Because in doing so , seniors exercise deep and controlled breathing .
If you ask for your lungs regularly , you do n't get out of the puddle in everyday life as well .
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
On older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labor Association of senior organizations .
In the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence .
Through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia-stricken people remember long-running events .
When singing , the head is also required to perform a special performance , explains Lenz .
At the same time focusing on your own voice and on a given rhythm , adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
It 's just older people who live alone , so do n't just focus on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by singing in the choir , according to Hackler .
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the chorus .
To show yourself : If I do for a long time for something , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
Good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
If you want to try a new hobby , do n't hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , Lenz advises .
You are not alone in singing - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes next ?
Looking for the right offer , seniors have different options , says Hackler .
Singing someone from the acquaintance 's circle in a senior choir , you can just join in .
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area .
If you want to sing in a church choir , you can turn directly to the community or the church precinct .
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
If you do n't have access to the Internet , you can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet search .
Those keen to sing should definitely join a chorus , Hackler advises .
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that 's true of any age .

Rio 2016 : ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
Not always the Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics .
This is shown by the bold appearance of ROBEL Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
At the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that at times he was no longer seen in the TV images .
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected .
On social networks , Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit .
In fact , the 24-year-old finished his pre-race with a lag of 48 seconds and finished in the 59th place of 59 starts .
It was , however , more his not exactly sporting figure that drew the attention of the international media .
Why the 24-year-old still attends the Olympics ?
The Ethiopians got a special starting right from the international swimming federation .
This will be distributed to promote swimming in under-represented countries .
As most athletes run in Äthopia , Habte simply wanted to do something else .
Preparation is everything : ROBEL Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race .
Quickly , the first nicknames made the rounds .
Some media described him as a `` ROBEL of the whale . ''
In reference to a `` wealth bump , '' the English tabloid `` The Sun '' made fun of him with `` Dad Bod . ''
His time , he struck only with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 metres overhead , played no part in it .
Comparisons with `` Eric the Eel '' were also drawn .
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics , the run of Eric Moussambani caused media attention .
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to compete on his own in a run-up over 100 metres .
Fittingly , Moussambani was fired at the time .
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the contest .

Donald Trump election campaign charged after staff allegedly pulled gun
New York : Donald Trump 's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina turned a firearm on an employee in February while traveling in a Jeep in February .
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the National Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in that state .
Bordini admitted to waiting for months that the matter would be dealt with internally before he realised that `` this would not happen . ''
The campaign manager , Earl Philip , `` pulled a pistol , put his right index finger on the deduction , and rammed the run in Vincents knee throat , '' Bordini admitted in his indictment .
After complaining to the local and regional campaign board , Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip , he admitted in the indictment .
`` Guns do n't have to be fired to cause harm , '' Bordini admitted .
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the `` Second Amendment people '' - firearms owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges .
Trump 's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence .
Bordini 's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for assault occasioning bodily harm and bleaching psychological damage .
Trump 's press secretary , Hope Hicks , could not be reached for comment .
Attempts to contact Philip also failed .
WCCB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
There has been no response to calls to his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far .
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc. , 16-CS-14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

CSF leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK swaps its boss Matthias Hartmann .
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprising .
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK foresaw that the chair of Chief Executive Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the successes he has promised .
Turmoil at the top of the Nuremberg market research firm GfK : After again disappointing business rates and the resignation of corporate governance , the industry 's world number five is facing a human fresh start .
CSF 's CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board , Arno Mahlert , is already leaving the supervisory board with effect from 12 September .
The leadership on the board already takes over the previous board member , Gerhard Hausruckinger , as of 1 September , the company said .
He is expected to officially take over the function of a `` CEO '' until a successor to Hartmann is found .
As a result of the resignations , the company cited `` different views '' on long-term business policy direction .
Details declined to name a company spokesman on Friday .
Who will run the market research company in the future is still unclear at the moment .
In investor circles , it was said on Friday that there was a great deal of disappointment among shareholders about the continued success of the restructuring that began years ago .
Mr Hartman has been at the GfK top since 2011 .
`` The fruits of the restructuring , however , are still not visible after 5 years , '' it said .
Given the recent poor GfK business figures , each shareholder will eventually be unsettled .
`` If that were the case with BMW , that would also make the quandts that way , '' they said .
The company had also been unable to stop its losing drive in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter .
At $ 361.2 million , sales were up 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable year-on-year quarter .
Related to the first half of the year , sales shrank by 3.4 per cent at $ 721.2 million .
Profit in the second quarter mainly impacted the company 's lowered value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
The company value write-off of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Division , gave the Group a loss of EUR 148.2 million .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GfK still generated a net profit of 19.7 million .

Supercup : Barca with concerns about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday .
The Catalans compete in the dugout for the Spanish Supercup against FC Sevilla , the replay rising three days later at the Camp Nou .
The doublewinner has to give up in the crofting dinner with the outspoken Cupfinalist and ruling Europa League champion among others on Neymar , who is disputing the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
Also missing is Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen .
The German suffered a blizzard in the knee in training , making the one-on-one issue at Barca , at least for now , cleared in favour of Claudio Bravo .
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refrained from making a clear decision in this respect , leaving Bravo in the league , but Ter Stegen takes the lead in most of the remaining contests .
Before the first must-win of the new season , at the Spanish Masters , there are doubts about the fitness condition of the team , which was humiliated at 0-4 on Saturday in a Test match by Liverpool .
Even at 3-2 in the Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday , Lionel Messi and co still did n't really know how to convince .
Sevilla , in turn , have to digest the 2-3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the `` Supercopa de Espana . ''
Barcelona , with eleven successes so far , are the record winners in this competition .

Culture of Political Correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim neighborhoods
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored , as a damning government report revealed today .
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally attacking the police , election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to `` over-sensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion . ''
The former minister for integration and local government , who is now an anti-corruption king , said that intimidating voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up shutters outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters .
He recommends that voters should carry an ID to prove their identity in elections .
At the moment , a voter only has to name his name and address .
The report suggests not wearing removable ink on a person 's finger when they cast their election vote to prevent anyone from voting twice .
Whistleblowers should be given more protection , says Sir Eric .
He calls for the press to have more access to community records and decisions from non-official committees or working groups .
`` This serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it , '' he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London .
Last year , a special electoral court ruled that the current mayor , Lutfur Rahman , should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
The court found that Rahman `` would have perverted '' the religious feelings of his Muslim community `` in a cynical manner '' and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic abuse .
Rahman is said to have `` run his campaign on the basis that it is the reliever duty of Muslims to elect him . ''
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation where a person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent briefing - where older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including driving out ways to prove identity
His report said : `` As evidence has been given that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the elderly , particularly communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background .
`` There were concerns that ... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of '' politically correct `` oversensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion . ''
Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban on political activists editing briefing papers to stop `` election harvests . ''
The report , which is being considered by Theresa May , also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral register from being used on immigration and social fraud purposes .
Consider options to ask voters before the election according to your ID .
Do n't use removable ink on a person 's finger as soon as they cast their vote to prevent anyone from voting twice .
Carry out systematic reviews of a person 's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote .
Ban that political activists process full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections .
Give the police the power to set up shutdowns around polling stations .
A change in the law that facilitates a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 .
Ban on photography at polling stations .
Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
Intensifying training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth on their own .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it `` amazing '' that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case .
`` The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unfit due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , '' he said .
He was found guilty for a number of reasons , in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
He also criticizes the ineffective `` abortion controls '' of the town halls `` electoral registration departments .
Sir Eric said : `` The court ruling in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal .
Our country , as the mother of parliaments , has a proud heritage , but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this reputation .

NASA climate model : Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
Scientists at NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus 's past using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
The model was designed to determine whether Venus , with its hot , watery surface and carbon-dense atmosphere , might once have had Earth-like conditions .
Scientists have previously hinted that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin , earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus .
The planet probably pointed to more dry neighborhoods than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic variability to house lives and protected against rapid evaporation .
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 per cent matter .
`` In the Giss model simulation , the slow turn of Venus exposed its day side of the sun for nearly two months , '' Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release .
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun 's heat .
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today .
The model spawned a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously believed by planetary scientists .
Although it was once believed to be habitable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
Their oceans darkened and their water vapour was burned away by the ultraviolet light .
As her hydrogen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which as we know it today .
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters .

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and `` defending champion '' Zhang Jike 4-0 ( 12.5.4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided final .
As a result , the world number one picked up the `` Golden Grand Slam '' with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour finals tournament and just Olympics .
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani .
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected , and made the title among themselves .
As a result , it was clear that , for the third time in a row , a Chinese would score the singles title in the sign of the Five Rings .
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic treble was former SVS-NÖ-Legionnaire Ryu Seung-min of South Korea .
Ma and Zhang were left at the plate alone , between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches at themselves .
Those had withdrawn to the grandstand and left their trenches in fair competition on their own .
'the matches up to here I 've played for my country . '
`` In the final , I 'm playing for me , '' Zhang had said logically .
After the match , gold and silver medallists posed with the China flag .
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided .
Ma had really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set .
After that , he determined the pace at the plate and left Zhang from there only a total of 13 points .
By the superiority of Ma did not develop the expected stirring match .
But there were nevertheless plenty of breathtaking ball changes to see .
Mizutani won the game for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4 : 1 .
The Belarussian had grabbed a rib injury in his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov , was in medical treatment afterwards , had to `` ultimately '' settle with sheet metal .
By the way , the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jörgen Persson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similarly high table tennis .

Condoms with chilipuder , fireworks promote Tanzanian elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to inhabited settlements in people - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipudes .
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation , which already had the idea to do so years ago , has intensified its promotion , along with US conservation , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals .
Previously , many spears used to defend themselves .
Friday is world phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
`` Since we developed the ... toolkit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , being much more confident that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant in it , '' the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a note .
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
If he is not deterred , a so-called `` Chilicloud '' is thrown .
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom , the end of which is turned down to the ignition .
When it is lit , the condom bursts with a bang and spits fine dust to Chilipuder into the air .
A touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant .
One last possibility is a scorer who shoots a gold fire in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

Patrick Roy resigns as coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy stepped down as coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday and introduced too little co-determination in the team 's decision-making process .
Alternatively President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed that decision and noted that the club will look for a new coach immediately .
`` Over the last three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , '' the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement .
I 've been thinking for a long time and a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , need it and bring it to a higher level .
To achieve this , the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
He must also have a co-determination right in decisions that affect the team 's performance .
These conditions are not being met at the moment .
Sakic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked him for his contributions for the team .
`` Patrick informed me of this decision today , '' Sakic said .
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was named the best coach in the league during his debut season at the Avalanches in 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams awards .
He led the club to 112 points and on first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota 's playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the two final years .
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild-card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper , Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .

Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Multiple deaths
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , the Foreign Ministry spokesman , Thomas Schnöll , said Friday morning .
She suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital but has already been able to leave it again .
Their journey home was planned for early September .
It is still unclear whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket , as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon , are still unclear .
The State Department is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard , according to Schnöll .
In the roughly 200 miles south of the capital , Bangkok , Hua Hin first exploded two bombs on Thursday night in a nightlife area .
According to police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning , then again , two explosives went up , while another man was killed , according to the authorities .
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning .
A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the seaside resort popular with holidaymakers , according to police figures .
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country , another bomb exploded , killing an urban employee .
The explosive device went into the air in a flower frame in front of the repose of coastal police , according to the authorities .
Finally , detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast claimed several casualties .
You go from a link to the explosions in Hua Hin , they said .
`` The bomb blasts carry the same handwriting , '' army general Danai Kritmethavee told journalists Friday morning .
'We assume it is a coordinated attack . '
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bomb blasts of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
Thai police , on the other hand , said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or with international terrorism .
`` This is just local sabotage , which is limited to limited areas and provinces , '' a spokesman in Bangkok said .
On the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta .
Authorities have received intelligence evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however they have not been informed of the exact timing and locations .
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
Police instructed their officials across the country to step up security around key government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
There are always minor bomb attacks in Thailand , but they are usually not directed against tourists .
In Hua Hin lies a palace used for years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
Following today 's bomb explosions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
High security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla , as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings .
After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need to travel to these provinces .
Increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta .
This gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to incite chaos , while the country was moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
The military unta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , is self-sustaining , bringing the kingdom back to stability and order .
However , the military has also failed to get to grips with the insurgency of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years .
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
Just over a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists .
It was the bloodiest attack in the country 's recent history .

Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania : `` Go where it hurts ''
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania : Locals do n't get anything from the summer campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote the country day .
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , they understood .
In 2021 , the assembly election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwerin Parliament has already decided earlier this year .
Because stupid as yet , it 's not : Summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that is biting .
The locals , who are to be persuaded by the campaign fighters , are on holiday .
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country , on Usedom , Rügen or Hiddensee , are not locals , so are not allowed to choose the country day .
In addition , there are practical problems : During the holidays , aid workers who hang up posters , blow up balloons , distribute flyers and , in the end , count out votes , only to find out .
Until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania will have to continue campaigning narrowly on the people .
The hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
And it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear for his office .
The SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU in polls .
What 's exciting is how heavily novice AfD is cutting off and what 's left in the end of coalition dust .
Sellering , 66 years old and has been chief executive since 2008 , makes an almost unobtrusive campaign , you can see from his big posters .
He travels through the country , handing out roses and chatting a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did .
Otherwise , Seelering has got cold feet and is blaming Chancellor Merkel for the flourish of the AfD .
Her refugee policy , her `` We create this '' has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists , which will now probably cost him the beautiful office .
The CDU with its top job , the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier , has already seen how it is when you are campaigning in the right place at the wrong time .
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies ; Merkel 's general election constituency is in the north-east .
But the target group did not agree , it was more North Rhine-Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony there as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern .
`` There was probably the majority from other federal states , '' complained Vincent Kokert , general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , recently in NDR .
But it does not pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
Otherwise , the Northeast CDU largely abandons the usual campaign stalls in marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons .
This , Kokert argues , only plays a `` subordinate role . ''
The Union , too , has realised that it is crumbling down the ground in the country , that it has to make a great effort to find a wire to the people again .
It is like the left , the SPD , the Greens : There is little in the country 's expanses .
However , the council of the CDU election campaigner Kokert to his co-workers is also self-exposing : `` You have to go where it hurts , which is where the people are : Dorffeste , Golden Weddings , every birthday party must be used . ''
Because much is at stake , Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly dedicated campaign .
In polls , the Social Democrats were last with 22 per cent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and just ahead of the AfD ( 19 ) .
In the 2011 election , the SPD still clearly won by 35.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , small party with seven per cent in the polls , are likely to make the leap into the country day .
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and largely move their campaign to the Internet .
`` Online campaigning , '' it calls the country 's president , Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green election campaigners are embarking on track-searching for native voting citizens among holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , the front-runner , just curls with a houseboat through the mecklenburgian lakes and still finds it beautiful .
Her impression : `` Election holiday in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment . ''

Nagold : Game and fun at summer release
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social-educational day group / social group work of the child protection group Nagold with their carers on their summer free time in Nussdorf , near Mühlacker .
In the quietly located leisure home Hardtwasldle , the life-loving group was quarantined during the first school holiday week .
Several full-day trips were on the programme .
For one thing , it went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoos .
On the other hand , to Maulbronn , where there was a special children 's guide in the world-famous monastery .
The third outing led to Pforzheim .
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf , the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts .
On the hot days , the group had fun at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn , which invited you to jump , swim and plan .
Children and caregivers have been pampered with their self-prepared meals , such as the Sauren Spätzle , the Seebronner Pfännle , Iselshauser-Bloff , the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese .
In workshops , tanned , beautiful pieces of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman-mill game .
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final `` Bunte evening . ''
On the day of the journey home , the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home .

Escape : `` Every winged woman has experience of sexual violence ''
Sexual violence is almost an everyday occurrence for women who flee on their own .
When they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatised .
A house offers sanctuary .
Four women sit in a large kitchen .
Each has a baby that is no more than a year old .
One has put her little son in his arm .
He guesses with big eyes curious in the room .
His mother stares at the table plate .
Until she realises she 's watching .
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one .
The scene looks normal .
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr .
She is division manager of Condrobs , a carrier for social support services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run , among others .
The four women in the kitchen have fled .
They live in Munich 's north in one of the few decentralised shelters for all-fleeing women and their children in Bavaria .
In January , Condrobs opened up the facility along with Pro Familia and the Munich Women 's Aid .
It has recently been officially opened .
Sixty people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
Men do n't exist - even as visitors .
The exception is a guard at the door .
`` It 's not an exaggeration to say : Every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her escape , '' Bahr says .
`` Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they face torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hopes , '' she told me .
In women , there are other reasons for the escape : `` Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out . ''
In their homeland , they have experience of sexual violence , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
That 's what drives them .
On the run , this continues .
`` The fact that smugglers are asking for a sexual act for a bottle of water , for example , is not uncommon , '' Bahr says .
And the women are on their own , they are not protected by their families .
Those who believe that the end once they arrive in Germany are mistaken , Bahr tells us .
Again , single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused at worst .
As a result , about 90 per cent of women living in accommodation in Munich 's north are traumatised , she estimates .
'Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . '
A lot of women are so used to saying they do n't say anything .
'or they do n't dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big . '
Since they often do n't know to help , there needs to be more accommodation only for them , Bahr claims .
In Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees .
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence , some say no .
In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodation .
Even in Swans , winged women alone are not housed separately , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government .
In Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central France , there are floors or houses only for single women and their children .
The exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men .
In a study published for the committee , it said : `` It is very important that men and women are housed separately . ''
`` Lack of privacy or being able to accommodate men and women together can lead to - continuing - violence against women . ''
In particular , the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women , the study says .
How much women feel this need for protection can be seen in the crowd that exists on the house in Munich .
`` Since getting around that it 's us , we have a long waiting list , '' Bahr says .
You could easily make up a second house .

Clinton 's and Trump 's economic policies in comparison : It 's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade deal - that 's what both Clinton and Trump want .
However , the two US presidential candidates are divided on tax and energy policy , as well as on a matter of principle .
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental , more philosophical difference .
The , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
He himself , by contrast , would be very different , Trump claims .
He will drive back regulations massively , and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , by contrast , says : The state has certain tasks to perform , he has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
That 's why taxes would be increased for the rich , she says .
Interestingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
In the need to be invested , Trump and Clinton say almost eloquently .
The Democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strongly opposed , for example , by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republican Party .
So on Trump , there could still be bipartisan discussions .
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ramp up coal production in the United States .
Oil production is also expected to be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate change agreement he wants to announce .
Clinton , by contrast , explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment programme , demanding : `` A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs . ''
'it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . '
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
TPP , the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement , both do not want to sign .
At the same time , however , both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
Those are then also expected to be paid better , asking about Clinton .
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 is a pittance .
He wants to increase it to $ 15 an hour .
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear : Once he says : The minimum wage has to go up , then he says he should not be changed .
But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps .
On one side is Trump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
His critics keep telling him that would only increase the budget deficit .
On the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to require the rich to pay more tax , and whose critics say : More tax is not the solution either .

A controversial baseball star resigns
Tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. baseball star in best days from Base to Base .
After his emotional resignation announcement , the 41-year-old pro will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays .
'i love this game and this team . '
`` I say 'Goodbye ' to both , '' declared the 14-time All-Star Game contestant of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Three times , Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signature under a 10-year contract gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
By the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach in the future - at full salary .
As a player , it paid Rodriguez a long time with performance .
With 696 homeruns , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( `` Runs '' ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees made some milestones .
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two other baseball players have similar values in the key stats .
But in the glory hall of the baseball , the 41-year-old is still unlikely to be included .
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname `` A-Rod '' - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
Back in 2009 , the superstar admitted to `` ESPN '' to have taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 , he was banned for 211 matches due to involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect to have received performance-enhancing funds for years through an anti-ageing clinic in South Florida .
After a legal battle , the ban was still reduced to 162 encounters .
`` The league might even have done me a favour for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , '' Rodriguez said sweetly at the time .
Even his farewell days do n't go noisily .
While many baseball legends have yet to get the big stage in their last few games , Rodriguez frequently had to sit on the bench .
'My job does n't include a farewell tour . '
`` My job involves trying to win every game , '' corroborated Yankees Coach Joe Girardi .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is demoted to the relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , received sympathy defections from fans from the Yankees arch-rival Boston Red Sox .
`` We want A-Rod , '' sang the supporters in the 4-9 defeat to the Rodriguez team .

Pokémon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that 's worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens , has been lamented by many in the last decade .
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active .
The time on screen was initially on the TV , then on video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
So it 's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer , of course , to the Pokémon Go-Wahn , an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990 `` s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , interest fell somewhat before the release of the game in the United States , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded .
Within days , Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons , who are tracked down with a GPS and , once found , can be `` photographed '' ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or `` captured . ''
A generation that played the game when she was even younger , joined the loo and jumped for the search from the sofa .
In the US , the game led to a significant rise in moves that put the `` average '' person back every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users , told The Washington Post recently that within two days of the game 's launch , the number of tracked people who train for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
The company does n't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement .
Many public health awareness campaigns that want to get people to `` take 30 minutes '' to `` get off the sofa '' and `` be active every day '' met on deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable .
Yet the importance of sport can not be overrated .
If you do sport regularly , you reduce your chances of developing cancer or depression .
Physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it causes people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
Thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people even join in the hunt for new friendships .
As always , there are also grumpy game-changers who always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could run against a door .
What 's it like ?
A breakthrough has occurred .
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports , as this game does .
The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
However , due to Pokemon 's success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Case of illness : When paid by the organiser
Diseased holidaymakers will only get money back after their journey if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
However , this is only the case when more than 10 per cent of guests have been shown to show the same symptoms .
In the negotiated case , a family was seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday .
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
Her illness led holidaymakers to a faulty sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater .
The family felt the trip was deficient with this - and complained against the organiser .
In court , the plaintiffs had no success .
It is true that the treatment plant was defective .
But the organiser only learned about it shortly before leaving the plaintiffs .
He had to assume by then that the seawater was fine .
So he did not violate his information obligations , according to the ruling .
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water .
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion to each other - is part of the general risk of death .
Of 691 guests , only 38 were ill .

Russia 's Putin flaunts Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly sacked his chief of staff , Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov was part of Putin 's closest trust group for many years .
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport .
In a statement from the Kremlin , it says that Putin , without giving reasons , `` ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . ''
Anton Vaino , who had been Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo .
On the Kremlin 's website , it says ( in Russian ) that he was later a protocol chief and chief of staff of the government staff .
Speaking about his appointment , he said to Putin : `` Thank you for your confidence . ''
I think that it is the government 's most important task to support your work as Head of State regarding draft laws and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
Convince the smiling faces ?
This move has mystified Moscow .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest confidants of Vladimir Putin and works as he does for Soviet intelligence , the KGB .
As chief of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
At a meeting with President Putin , which aired on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning at his own request .
But despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle ?
No one knows at the moment .
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president at one time wants to guide Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism .
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin 's website , Ivanov said `` it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - arduous post for four years .
As it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov took the post in December 2011 .
Previously , he was deputy prime minister and defence minister .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the State Security Service KGB .
In the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) that replaced the KGB , Ivanov was appointed his deputy .
When Putin came to power , he named Ivanov as one of five people he most trusted .
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin 's second term , as Putin 's third term would have violated the constitution .
But that post was taken by another , close ally of Putin , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three-and-a-half years later .

31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water-purpose association `` Veitensteingruppe , '' Ruppert Göller , is retiring .
The association is considered `` Bavarian-wide exemplary . ''
A small fringed drinking water association as a role model for the big water producers .
So it was said some time ago in the original tone in a post by the Bavarian broadcaster .
Soon after , the water forum of the government of Unterfranken honored the Zweckverband .
The work of the Veitensteingroup was `` Bavaria-wide as exemplary . ''
Behind all this is Rupert Göller , who has been a staff member for 31 years , including 28 years as managing director .
Now he was retired at the age of 65 .
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitensteingroup , based in Kottendorf , municipality of Breitbrunn , promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants .
Member communities are the municipalities of Kirchlouder , Breitbrunn , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach .
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
The current chairman , Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director in 1988 .
`` His duties have been very diverse and they stretched from the waterline construction and maintenance work through office and organisational activities , budgeting , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , '' the chairwoman said .
As an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the rehabilitation of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the reconnection of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water lines .
There has been no standstill and there have been repeated innovations , because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
In her laudato , she praised Göllers ' loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
He has used himself with a lot of heartache for his water-ring association and he has really lived the water-ring association as if it were his own company .
A few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the concept of success of the Veitensteingroup to the nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken .
He received a great deal of praise and praise for that .
Rupert Göller , for his part , praised water keeper Alfons Griebel , who worked with him for 28 years .
He 's the best water keeper and he was a loyal crap .
Together we were an unbeatable team .
As highlights from his point of view , he described the fountain construction and the restructuring of the purpose-building association .
The biggest challenge and the most difficult effort , however , was the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlouder on a January 3 .
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the towns could be provided with water .
Once again , the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained , because the Pettstadt reservoir was filled with hoses .
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel striker from Lauter , who is taking over the succession of Rupert Göller .

Olympics 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught : Because of a positive doping test , weightlifter Adrian Zielinski may not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases .
An evaded athlete would have almost won a medal .
Before the seventh day of competition , the first official doping cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa of Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have been tested positive and ruled out in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics contests , these messages come at an unstoppable time .
In the case of Chen , last Sunday , the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid was shown to be used as a masking tool for doping substances .
The International Sports Court of CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time .
On Sunday , the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100m butterfly , only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen would have been expected to take part in the precincts over 50m freeway .
Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
The national federation takes the matter `` very seriously and requires Chen 's full cooperation in the investigations , '' Xinhua quoted from a statement : `` We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the ruling . ''
For the first time in history , it is no longer the IOC but the CAS responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases .
Also on the night of Rio , the news leaked about the positive sample at Danekowa , saying the 33-year-old went on the offense himself .
`` I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , '' saying this was `` an incredible shock , '' she told Bulgarian TV station BNT .
She is innocent , `` the only explanation could be dietary supplements , '' the athletics explained .
According to the report , the banned substance is said to be the blood-doping drug EPO .
Danekowa was provisionally suspended , according to BNT , the B sample is also said to have already been positive .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister Bojko Borisov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete .
`` I do n't understand why athletes do n't draw the right conclusions , '' he said : `` We Bulgarians are under observation so many have already been ruled out . ''
For example , all weightlifters from the chronically doped nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
On Friday , the case was also known as `` Adrian Zielinski , '' the London-based Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tomasz tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier .
Both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
Before the start of athletics , especially the Danekowa case is another major blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
The world governing body , IAAF , had banned the complete Russian team except for an exception due to systematic doping , including the runner-up Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
In addition , in the swimming sport , the earlier offences in China had caused fierce clashes between the athletes as well .
So Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly .
`` Sun Yang pinches purple . ''
`` When I see the podium over 200m freeway , I want to pass , '' Lacourt said on French radio .
Sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton .
`` I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters , '' this one said .
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese championships , but only had to sit down a three-month ban .

He risked everything to save others ' lives .
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the `` White Helmets , '' a civil protection group that , according to Bild newspaper , has so far saved close to 60,000 people .
2900 volunteers are risking their own lives to draw people from bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone .
They are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : A video of the civil guard showing him during an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
It made the Syrians the shining symbol in the horrors of war .
However , as a hero , he never saw himself , saying , according to Bild : `` For me , this is the real jihad . ''
'If I 'm dying to save lives , I think God sees in me a martyr . '
Just before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the latest bombing in Syria .
The helicopters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
A woman and two children died , seven people suffering from breathlessness .
`` We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that not children play with it , '' the image quoted his last words before he died .
The Assad regime 's deadly bomb had been intended to hit terrorists .

Treats want nude kalendar for `` women and for men ''
The Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Kalendar for 2017 .
But instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017 .
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was distinguishable from Oldschool Playboys , since `` Playboy is for men . ''
I do this for women .
He seems to believe that the Kalendar does , too .
`` We need to return to the display of timeless and classic nudity , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , '' Shaw said in a press release on the release of the Kalendars .
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market .
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
It was thicker and bigger , so it was n't well in hand .
On the contrary , it was pretty knock-on .
The built-in memory initially was eight megabytes , which would be enough today for roughly two selfies with high resolution .
An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes .
The `` Nokia 9000 Communicator '' came into business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone .
For a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
Twenty years ago , however , the Communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as an `` office in Westentaschenformat . ''
In fact , the new mobile phone could do a lot for then standards : SMS and e-mails could be sent and received , even by fax was to reach the Communicator .
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser , albeit agonisingly slow .
A calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the phone could be folded up in the same way as a laptop .
Then found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
Pretty proud was the price : 2700 D-Mark , which is about $ 1400 .
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was $ 392 in 2015 .
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
Everything has changed since then .
The smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and settled .
Today , the market is dominated by suppliers , all of whom came much later than Nokia .
Always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday .
In 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
About 1.4 billion devices have been sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units .
Global sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros .
This is followed by the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
Around the smartphone , an entire industry has since emerged .
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007 , at the time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on Mac World the introduction of the iPhone .
He promised three devices in one : A music player , a phone and an internet communicator , all by touch screen easy to use .
Apple 's winning streak began , even today the iPhone is the group 's most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , which dominated the market , had the sequel .
They eventually disappeared , Blackberry has struggled .
The ire now has Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung .
The smartphone is self-evident 20 years after its invention .
On average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
`` We all need to learn to move the smartphone away , too , '' said just Janina Ball , in charge of the Siemens board of staff .
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .

Building ground in double pack
With issues around building , the council has focused on the most recent meeting .
With relief , the panel took the message from Mayor Robert Putz that `` finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . ''
The sale of land in the residential areas `` Straslweg '' and `` Schönau-West '' ( Binderstraße - expansion section 1 ) is no longer an obstacle to the sale of land in the residential areas `` Straslweg '' and `` Schönau-West . ''
The local council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and troubled seniors alike .
As it was said , builders can now report to the town hall , about the awarding of the plots , the council is expected to advise at its September meeting .
In order to be able to comply with requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises , linked to job creation , the local council decided to amend the land-use plan , which was only re-created in the spring of this year , in sub-areas .
For example , in the area of Unterzeitlarn , the industrial area already designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of State Route 2112 .

What the Jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook .
In December 2014 , he first picked up gold at the short-track world championships in Doha , while at the same time setting his first world record .
Now , former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has faced criticism from his ex-teammates via Facebook .
`` In a country where an Olympic champion gets a £20,000 premium and a jungle king £150,000 , no one should be surprised about missing medals , '' the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on the night of Friday .
The support system in swimming is bad , but the doping controls are very good .
In this way , we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely or even operate on the subject of doping .
`` I 'm not saying that the controls should be stopped here , '' he continued .
If he wanted to start a comeback , Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency of Germany ( NADA ) .
That is exactly how we should keep it with countries .
`` Anyone who can not be controlled a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS by independent inspectors of WADA / FINA may not be allowed to participate , '' claims the election hamburger , who now runs an ice cream shop .

The right-wing `` identitarian movement '' has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
According to several national offices , the constitutionalists in the federal government have also put the group under observation .
`` We see in the 'identitarian movement ' evidence of aspirations against the liberal democratic basic order , '' said Constitutional Court Judge Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
In this way , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffused in an extremist way .
That 's why we 're watching the movement now as well .
The `` Identitarian Movement '' is a grouping with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 .
It opposes `` multiculturalism , '' `` uncontrolled mass immigration '' and the `` loss of its own identity through alienation . ''
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hesse , Berlin , Baden-Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the `` identitarian . ''
Maassen said his authority was working closely with the state 's offices in the decision .
`` Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement ' are trying to pick their target group out of where it stands , '' the constitutional chief said .
In general , extremists try to address them with youthful language , often with popping music .
This would be done by Islamists as well as right-wing extremists .
This is not a good advertisement for your own cause .
The propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally .
Young people are particularly vulnerable .
This is dangerous .
Most recently , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the `` identitarian '' to AfD politicians .
Maassen said he has no knowledge of this .
For constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
It comes down to whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people who are extremist , changes its direction and becomes so extremist .
The decisive factor , then , is whether such individuals have a controlling influence on the party .
This is not apparent .
Referring to the significant increase in legally-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters , Maassen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context .
But we have found in the past few years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures .
There was the group 'Old School Society ' or the Friday group .
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups , or micro-groups , are planning attacks against asylum seekers , refugee shelters , or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives .
However , a German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is unrecognisable .
The previous groups were created at the regional level or on social networks .
Concerned , Maaßen said that many assaults went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene .
That is the worrying thing .
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene .
`` So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who were perhaps politically indifferent or elected , for example , by the CDU , the SPD or the left , who were then radicalised by right-wing extremist sentiment . ''

He also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games as a result of a ruling by the International Sports Court , CAS .
At 80.04 m , he is ranked second in the world rankings .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : The world record holder and gold favourite only tested positive in May , but may still start in Rio .
At the 29-year-old world champion , evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement was found , the ban by the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and ran as early as July 13 .

Asocial family destroyed in front of Delogovernment social flat in Saltash , Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing estate after a Delogovernment was charged with damages of £50,000 because it had terrorised their neighbours .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash , Cornwall , after a long list of complaints .
After being forcibly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition .
The walls pointed out gaping holes , wooden dials were torn up , rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls .
The family were resettled and it is believed she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy , who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing , said that she feared the home would no longer be repaired .
She said : `` It has been an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do n't have to live in this way .
There are many things to consider , as this property will probably be regarded as a not so beautiful part of Cornwall .
The family is notorious and their reputation is too .
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and police said that the terror that had been inflicted on the family included street fights with baseball bats , intimidating residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive shouting , disputes and floods .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the rental contract , got an order for antisocial behaviour in June .
In some rooms of the house , which will be demolished in some circumstances , old rubbish was found
It was found in the property where drugs were traded in the past , the wooden dials were torn up
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly had to call the police
Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner violently from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out .
The Delogovernment was cheered by relieved neighbours who said that their lives were made hell .
One said : `` They were n't snapping around anyone . ''
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
'This morning we could n't sleep . '
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we 're not used to that !
Now that they 're finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities .
The family lived in the house , to which police were called at regular intervals , 20 years on
On the overgrown side of the community house , rubbish and old toys were thrown down
He added : `` It is a disgrace that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as a Delogovernment is always the final step considering Cornwall Housing .
This was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible to watch for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that has been done by my team , the Devon and Cornwall Police , as well as members of the community who have bravely joined us and have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the house 's bedrooms according to the Delogovernment
Workers at the home administration will now have to clean up rubbish mountains that surround the house
In 2014 , police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and cash in excess of £1,700 .
Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug in trade review .
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son , Lee Skeldon , who was killed in a car crash in 2013 .
After being without shelter , it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
Many room walls of the house were coated with graffiti .
Police say she will deloculate tenants who do n't adhere to the house order
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said that the Delogovernment was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not abide by the house order .
`` This goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach , as well as to those who have been harmed by such behaviour , '' she said .
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Woman overpowered in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night .
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman went overboard in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight .
A woman put himself on the road in the dark `` in an act of desperation '' and were hit by several cars , police in Vaud said .
It is obvious that a Swiss woman , aged 49 , who was overpowered by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
She still passed away on the ground .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said police , who are urging these as well as any witnesses to the incident to sign up .
An investigation has been opened , which is a `` logical '' step in such a situation , Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen if any of the drivers will be displayed .
Was a collision avoidable ?
That 's something the prosecutor has to decide , `` Hofstetter said .
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable .
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists do n't have to assume that a pedestrian walks on the highway in the middle of the night , as stated in the newspaper .
Last year , a policewoman was acquitted of negligent homicide after she overpowered and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014 .
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has become unconscious on the street , arresting the court .
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a `` completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation , '' the judge said .
Anyone who has any further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .

Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable .
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer , with some colleagues , was looking for a bit of variety with a walkout on the beach .
For the 58-year-old , it was a first .
Chio : 'Golden sports pyramid ' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes , the horses were reminded of their holidays , they joked in the fast gallop home to the feeding comforters .
One kilometre at that pace , I 've been scared .
`` It was n't a good experience , '' Langer says .
And that ended the riding career again .
On Saturday , Germany 's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses .
He left with his family over the plant of the ALRV , on a horse he swung not even for photo purposes .
Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO .
The reason was quite convincing .
German Sport Relief handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid .
The likeable athlete is not lacking in awards .
Federal treasurer , silver laurel leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ...
Even the British Queen has already adored him .
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
In Aachen , he met the first prize winner , Hans Günter Winkler , on Saturday .
`` This award means a lot to me , '' says Langer , `` because it is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social engagement . ''
For decades , Langer has been promoting the young .
And so he also gave the prize money of $ 25,000 right away .
With 15 other outstanding athletes , the two-time U.S. Masters winner was inducted into the `` Hall of Fame of German Sports '' on Saturday .
Among the excluded are athletics Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt , Turner Eberhard Gienger , the fussy Cornelia Hanisch , Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt , the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe , the Judoka Frank Wieneke , the Judoka Frank Wieneke , the jumper Alwin Shockemöhle and posthumous handyman Erhard Wunderlich .
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday .
After the official part , the illustrious company wandered into the jumping stadium , where the Lavazza price ran .
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals .

Post rises in trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
The interest of other firms in the brew appears to be large .
The Post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter , too .
In due course , the corporation intends to start trading in the van .
The Post wants to offer its electric vans on the free car market from next year as well .
`` We want to get into the sale to third parties , '' a Post spokesman said Friday .
The company has been considering for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter , with the letters and packs , to be sold to other businesses as well .
Post board member Jürgen Gerdes had said there were ongoing enquiries , for instance , from tradesmen .
According to the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bonn Group intends to enter the mass production of vehicles in the near future .
In the poaching factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Gerdes had announced that the corporation wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and ply a complete conversion to the eco-friendly vehicles in the long term .
`` We will make a very , very robust move towards 2020 , '' he had said in late July .
I can imagine we 're going to change the entire fleet .
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany 's roads since 2014 .

`` A generation protesting '' in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
Witnesses say that tens of protestors were killed during the clashes with police during gunfire .
Is Ethiopia about to collapse ?
Over the past decade , it has been one of Africa 's most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy .
But in recent months , protests against the government rocked the country and expanded into more and more areas .
Last week , thousands of people stormed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
The government 's response was ruthless , according to human rights organizations .
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed on tens of unarmed protesters .
Videos in circulation about the protests , which are believed to be from the last or early this year , show how security guards beat young people with sticks , while these have been forced to make a handstand against a wall .
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now demanding an in-depth investigation .
`` It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , '' said Rashid Abdi , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
After Nigeria , Ethiopia is Africa 's most populous country and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region , particularly in Somalia ; few countries in Africa , if any , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia 's economy expanded at a considerable pace .
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital , Addis Ababa .
The streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously cited repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissidents effectively silenced .
Many were sent into exile or sent to prison , killed or driven into the expanses of the desert .
But that could change .
`` If you suppress people and these have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , '' said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
All the youth are protesting .
A generation protesting .
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament .
At the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea ; a battle over this jagged , controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front , which have been more or less defeated in recent years , could exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves .
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of crashing beneath the surface .
The first seems harmless : Smartphones .
It was only in recent years that very many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and Internet services improved .
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they reside .
Several young Ethiopians said that they so gathered to protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since aeons , the Amharas , who come from Ethiopia 's predominantly Christian highlands , have prospered in politics and economics , while exploiting the Oromos , many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas .
But that , too , is just changing .
`` We are in the process of coordinating under an umbrella , '' said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of Oromos .
The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group , who make up around 6 per cent of the population and who are dominant in the military , intelligence , trade and politics .
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was Ethiopia 's prime minister for 17 years until his death on an undisclosed illness in 2012 .
He was viewed as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
Analysts say he was particularly adept at perceiving early signs of discontent and using special representatives to process opponents and make them harmless .
`` The current regime lacks this fundamental skill , '' said Mr. Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopia 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles .
Unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray .
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005 , after thousands protested against elections that , according to analysts , were seemingly botched by the government and subsequently stolen .
During the subsequent raids , many protestors were killed , even though it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest went over relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction .
But it appears that this has not prevented an intensification of the internal resentment of the Ethiopian Government .
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month , protestors in Gondar , an amhardy city , attacked Tigray , and hatred of the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media .
Analysts say that the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position .
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed that base .
While the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
`` This , '' Mr. Abdi said , `` is a very thin tightrope . ''

Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is expected to be reduced to a back-office role , according to the bank 's chief executive .
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank 's global ambitions .
The bank has since distanced itself when it nearly collapsed and rescued eight years ago .
During this time , brand strategists have used `` RBS '' to protect other end-consumer financial brands .
She supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship , from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now it has decided to focus more national brands .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all RSB references , devolved headquarters and stock market listing will switch to NatWest .
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other , smaller brands for retail banking that will be given more prominence - Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's Military Bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire .
He told BBC Scotland : `` The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands . ''
When the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became a global brand .
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals .
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our staff will work with customers under these brands .
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
`` It 's time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? '' The chief executive said .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see a lot of changes .
We can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was `` sarcasm ''
Donald J. Trump on Friday sought to dispel the latest controversy that surrounds his campaign by suggesting that his oft-repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the `` founders '' of the Islamic State group had not been serious .
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate in a clear and understandable way with the American public .
It also brings his associates , who seek to protect him during an eventful period , in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all .
After making the suggestion at a campaign event Wednesday night , Mr. Trump ruffled back in relation to the claim on Thursday , insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic .
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation was utterly serious .
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump soften the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate did n't want to know anything about it .
The latest storm of criticism boils down to Mr. Trump , while he has tried to deflect the focus of his campaign because of falling poll numbers on the economic situation .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again .
Speaking on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has already put sarcasm to his defense .
At the end of July , he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but he later declared `` Of course I meant the sarcastic . ''
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rustle back as needed .
`` I think it 's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , '' clarify `` depending on what the reaction is , '' said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates .
However , I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in various ways .
Instead of defying the tone for presidential elections , Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone as his poll numbers have continued to decline .
A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist , which was released Friday , showed a lead with a large lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida .
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks , he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his sense of humour .
But while he is increasingly the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's jokes have put his loyal associates in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him , regardless of how provocative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , a former mayor of New York and one of Trump 's most prominent advocates , made a big effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview Thursday .
`` I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , '' so Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned on the accuracy of Mr. Trump 's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them backbenchers , utterly wrong and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state , allowed ISIS to spread out by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East .
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media , accusing them of riding on each of his words and being biased against him .
He derided the `` poor , pitiful '' television experts trying to understand him and said , `` You ca n't do it ! . ''
Some of the Democrats spooked over Mr. Trump 's apology as just one more proof that he was unsuitable for president .

Donald Trump acknowledges ″ huge problems ″ in campaign
The US Republican leadership is plagued by massive worries about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the previous Republican stronghold of Utah .
A rare moment in which the normally pompous and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns , as correspondents reported .
Having thrown 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race , there are now growing doubts about his success in the battle for the White House .
`` We have huge problems in Utah , '' Trump told evangelical Christians he asked for support in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
Blaming false reports about his candidacy , he again took on his well-known media scorn .
Republican strongholds wobble
Utah is normally a safe bank for Republicans .
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June , Trump and his rival from the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , equalised .
Other institutions see Trump ahead , though not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk .
In an interview on CNBC , Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton 's advance again : `` Just as I 've done so far . ''
And snaps afterwards : This will `` either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . ''
He does n't do anything other than `` telling the truth . ''
If it was n't enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that 's OK , Trump said .
Then I return to a very good way of life .
According to press reports , the Trump party is said to have threatened to scrap funds to support his campaign should he not be able to present better polls .
Instead , they want to give more support to the Republican candidates for Congress .

North eseeoil workers resume talks , set strike
Labour disputes regarding pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all the warring parties are set for a new round of talks at the table , negotiators said .
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been conducted intermittently on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
`` Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute , '' it said in a joint statement .
We will hold some full-day sessions over the next few weeks , which will start early next year to re-address the problems .
Unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against potential pay cuts of up to 30 per cent .
Wood Group this year cut rates to its Contractors in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
The company 's council cut follows a 10 per cent decline for onshore contractors in 2014 .
The company said that additional cuts will give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn .
Shell , for its part , has sacked thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had been exacerbated by the decision by Britons in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with working-class leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea for a generation .
The North Sea is important to the regional economy , he said .
`` In the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , '' he said in a statement .
In 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of about $ 7 billion over the past five years .

Improving the flow of traffic on the motorway
It stumps regularly on the bypass - here 's a picture of November .
But this is about to change : The legal absentee is to be extended .
This is good news for all car ­ drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every night when they drive through the highway ­ feeder ( A 43 ) .
The state-run road construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the exit of Weseler Street , the right-wing lane by 700 metres .
Motorists can then walk directly from Hammer Street on the right .
The big advantage : The traffic is divided early , improving the overall process on the busiest section of the Federal Highway 51 .
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West .
The carriageway on the feeder is annoying motorists especially between 5pm and 7pm .
On weekdays , the backlog extends to the bridge over the Alberslog path and sometimes beyond .
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the exit of Weseler Strasse .
From here , traffic is channelled only one-way through the motorway bridge .
The second track had to be built back just over three-quarters years ago .
The reason : Static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absorb heavy goods traffic in a two-way way .
How long this bottleneck and the associated day-to-day congestion will continue , the relevant national operation can not say .
However , with years to be expected : Because the bridge has an official residual benefit period until 2034 .
For the extension of the legal absentee , the country 's operations deliberately selected the traffic-weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected .
Traffic will run one-way past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .

Mahaj Brown , 6 , 'wiped out by bullets ' , survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say that the 6-year-old boy was fired in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot .
The boy 's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown .
The grandparents said that Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including in the lance , leg , arm and abdomen , but that he was at awareness during his transport to the hospital .
`` He went through a lot , his little body was pierced by bullets , '' his grandmother , Delores Melendez , told the station .
I just ca n't believe that .
The boy 's condition was deemed critical in a hospital and he had to undergo multiple operations .
The boy 's family told the station that he expected to be gendered again .
He should have started first class at a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people fired in Germantown .
Also fired were three men : Two aged 29 and a 32-year-old .
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition , according to CBS Philadelphia .
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old , who is in a critical condition , the station reports .
The other two victims were not in the car and police are just investigating whether under one of the injured men could be the perpetrator .

Mecklenburg power : 'going where it hurts
Strange Mecklenburg powers : the locals get nothing back from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North North West West are not allowed to choose the country .
In Mecklenburg , they understood .
In 2021 , the land election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy parliament has already decided earlier this year .
Because than before , it 's not about : summer holidays , heat and rural election campaign - biting .
The locals to be convinced by campaigners are on holiday .
Most holidaymakers who are in the country on Usedom , Russia or Hiddensee are not locals , so they may not vote the country .
These are practical problems : in the holidays , workers who hang posters hang up , blowing balloons , distributing flyers and counting at the end of votes , only painful to feature .
By the time of September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg Pomeranians once still have to campaign barely past themselves over .
The hot period , if you can say that ever , has just begun .
And it 's also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear for his office .
The SPD , since 1998 's strongest party , is now clear in polls behind the CDU .
Exciting , how strongly New AfD cuts down and what remains left on the end of the coalition .
Celering , 66 years old and since 2008 chief executives , makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign , seeing its big posters .
He travels through land , distributing roses and chatting a little with people , just as it also did his legendary worthy predecessor Harald Ringstorff .
Otherwise , sailoring has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel blamed on the bloom of the AfD .
Their refugee policy , her we create that , have accelerated the rise of legal populists , which will probably cost him the beautiful office .
The CDU with its top candidate , Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigning at the wrong time at the right place .
She has invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to big rallies ; Merkel federal election constituency is in the Northeast .
But the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine Westphalians , Berliners and Saxony than Mecklenburger and premeditation .
As there was probably the majority from other federal states , Vincent cocktails , general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg , recently in the NDR .
But it is also a pity no one from other corners of Germany to listen once Angela Merkel .
Otherwise , the northeastern CDU is largely renouncing the usual campaign standings on marketplaces and before shopping centres with sunshines and aerial balloons .
That , so thinks costume , play only a 'subdued role. ``
The union has also noted that on the country , it takes away the base that it needs to be very exhausted again to find a wire to people .
You go like the left , the SPD , the Greens : barely available in the expansions of the country .
However , the CDU campaigner 's concern to his comrades is also self-defensive : `` you have to go where it hurts , namely where people are : village festivals , Golden Weddings , every birthday party must be used . ''
Because much is at stake , Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
In polls , the Social Democrats were last with 22 per cent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just before the AfD ( 19 ) .
At the 2011 election , the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 per cent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , small party with seven per cent in the polls , are likely to create the jump in the country .
They make out of holiday distress a modern virtue and move their campaigning largely to the internet .
Online campaigning , calling it the country 's chairman Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green campaigners are encountering lane search for domestic voting citizens among the holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , the top candidate , is straight with a houseboat through the mecklenburgic lakes and it also finds it still beautiful .
Her impression : 'polling holidays in Mecklenburg is not a punishment. ``

Donald Trump campaign charged after staff allegedly moved gun
New York : Donald Trump 's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after her told her campaign leader for North Carolina in February was aimed at a staff while travelling in a jeep in February .
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the County Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
Bordini admitted for money that the matter would be settled internally before realising that this would not happen .
The campaign leader , Earl Philip , drew a pistol , put his right index finger on the deduction , and rammed the run in Vincents knee chair , gave Bordini in his charge .
Having complained to the local and regional campaign line , Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip , he admitted in the indictment .
Weapons do n't have to be fired for damage , `` admitted Bordini .
The charge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered an uproar when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the Second Amendment people should take action - if his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and judges should appoint .
Trump 's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not stack up for violence .
Bordini 's complaint requires damages from the campaign for breaching care duty and from Philip because of bodily injury and leading psychological damage .
Trump 's press secretary Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion .
Attempts to contact Philip equally failed .
WCCC , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
On calls at its consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been responded .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far .
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc. , 16-C-14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

Future of Portland 's meltdown because of lifting the energy contract is questionable
The future of Portland 's aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts , as the delivery energy company reported .
This move followed the government 's decision in Victoria earlier this year to give no further subsidies to the operation of the facility .
A subsidy set for 20 years is running in November .
Up to 2,000 jobs at the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake .
No fewer than 2,000 jobs directly , as well as indirect - could be endangered in closure .
In addition , it could come to domino effects as the melting about 10 per cent of Victoria 's entire power generation .
2014 , Alcoa closed the Point Henry meltdown , leading to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alcoa 's meltdown in Portland loses money and risks closing .
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the power price for the facility .
AGL , which delivers the large aluminium melting with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley , announced that it assumes that three other owners will terminate their contracts .
The facility is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina , of which Chinese companies CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares .
AGL assumes the facility will continue to operate in Portland , which includes another physical demand for electricity through the meltdown , `` the company said .
AGL continues to say that the contracts were so-called security businesses , which should have entered into force from November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will end in 2017 .
Of course , AGC assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year , `` the power supplier said .
Any potential implications for revenue on AGL from the DJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale currency prices .
AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $ 187 million in an expectation of a termination .
Alcoa said the decision to book the contracts will not affect the capacity of Alcoas ... or guaranteeing power supplies to melting. ``
The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if it 's still guilty of a statement why it resigned from the contract .
Analysts warn of the industry 's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle .
In reference to the statements of the analysts earlier this week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumed around 600 megawatts and Tomago annually around 900 megawatts to electricity .
Should both facilities disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the power market .
And for us as an electricity producer , that would n't be good , `` he said .

Olympia : threesty fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya 's athletes are threatened after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
The International Olympic Committee told to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
A Kenyan official had told that the former sprinter and today 's coach , John Anzrah , made a urine sample under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich 's name .
This has been reported by the team management of Kenya by the doping inspectors .
The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC to inform the case to engage its own investigations , an IAAF spokesman said .
Depending on the results of the investigation and the IOC 's following measures , the IAAF will make an assessment , `` it said in an IAAF statement .
He ( American ) has gone to the doping control station and has spent themselves as Ferguson Rotich , the test made and signed , `` explained Kenyan chief executive de Mission Stephan Arap Soi .
He was in possession of the athlete 's accreditation , which was on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency .
Ferguson Rotich was in Beijing 's World Cup fourth over 800 metres in 2015 .
Four days earlier , Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
He is expected to be informed against money payments athletes of his country over upcoming doping tests .
According to media reports , he should have been arrested in his return at Nairobi airport .
Kenya faces IOC after numerous doping offences have been under special observation for a long time .
When announcing the IOC launched more than 2,000 doping target controls before the Rio Games , unusually previously pointed out that particularly athletes will be targeted from Kenya and Russia .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had played a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Games , creating an anti-doping law and a functioning control system .
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympic begins .
In a row , WADA Kenya took off from the list of countries whose doping compliance is compliant with WADA rules .
Kenya is considered a big runner nation .
The country 's athletes won at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing most medals .
In a series of television reports from the ARD , allegations have been raised repeatedly that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he employed her in Russian athletics .
In doing so , it was possible to prove that in this sport , it was covered and systematically doped .
Russia 's athletes were then ruled out from the summer games .

The state had to respond calmly and determinedly at the same time on terror risks .
Sure : our country will not answer the offenders ' violence with hatred and divide .
We wo n't give this triumph to the terrorists .
If criminals would have to leave faster , though , it increases security and also strengthens the population 's consent for refugee policy .
De Maizière wants to reach an implementation of the proposals until the 2017 federal election .
He also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces , and that 's in medium-sized magnitude over several years. ``
Sympathy for terrorism must be back under punishment .
Video surveillance is intended to improve the gun right that is mainly hampered by the purchase of weapons on the internet .

Police : 3 victims shot in series murder of music listening in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the fatal attacks for the first time in a decade in the first serial murder of Phoenix , while heard in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis 's daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway , the authorities said .
The offender fired eight shots from a hand firearm while he stood on the front side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , in the report .
Police announced that the three-time murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery , as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix Sgt . Jonathan Howard 's police spokesman said the shooting led the investigators to be a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
Overall , predominantly in Hispanic residential areas , seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in nine attacks .
's happening in a residential area in front of a house , `` told Howard of KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , earlier this month .
It is believed the suspect used several vehicles , including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later .
Liners , 31 , and Ellis daughter Maleah still died on the ground .
One witness told police that it was n't unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before three-time murder and which will be expected that it was the work of the serial killer .
Investigators found cartridges and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the motor room .

North Sea workers take talks again , set strike
Labour fights regarding pay for North Sea oil workers are being suspended , while all parties are putting on the table for a new round of conversations , negotiators said .
Strikes against oil service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea , which will be operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
Wood Group , as well as the Unite and RMT unions , can confirm that we have agreed to reshape the delivery process of the current dispute , `` it said in a common statement .
We will be holding some full-day sessions in the next few weeks that will start early next year to reassess the problems .
Unions said their latest strike , which is the first over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 per cent .
Wood Group has cut this year 's rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent because of negative market pressure .
The company 's council cut follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014 .
The company said that additional cuts to the company are giving the needed room to come through the downturn .
Shell has sacked for his part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas businesses into up to 10 countries as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its merger with British energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had strengthened by the British 's decision to leave the European Union in June .
Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met with workers earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that had taken place for a generation in the North Sea .
The North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
In the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , `` he said in a statement .
In 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea compared with an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years .

Military leadership distort ISIS intelligence information , presents committee of Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it allowed actual conditions on the ground , an investigative committee of Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
The preliminary report , created by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Force Committee , intelligence committees and anti-budget committees , reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed its assessments on the U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
The Central Command , briefly Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` Intelligence information that was typically dismissed by senior CENTCOM commanders , regularly drawing a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground were allowed and were more positive than analysis of other news services , a newspaper article quoted the report .
What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analysis is presented by our political leaders , `` stated Ken Calvert , Republican member of the House of Representatives .
The leadership error at CENTCOM ranges to the top tip of the organisation .
The ten-side report shows detailed consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces .
Although there is no direct indication that government peaks have given under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts suffered pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` During the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before Congress were much more positive than it matches the facts , the report noted .
For example , a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military recovery could begin Mossuls as early as April or May 2015 .
Mossul , second-largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic state .
After months of investigation , it is so clear. , said Mike Pompeo , Republican Congressman from Kansas , in an opinion .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command 's leaders changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
Republicans called the task force into life after playing that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
The report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue .
In addition , further investigation is underway by CENTCOM reports by the Defense Ministry 's general inspector .
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published on Thursday their own findings , which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force 's conclusions .
In 2014 and 2015 , CENTCOM created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services , `` admitted to the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee , a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion .
This process , according to Mr Schiff , delayed the publication of intelligence reports , damaging morality among analysts and gave overly little room for dissent. ``
But Mr Schiff and Democrats said no evidence of an intervention by the White House at the CENTCOM analysts was found in terms of a particular political opinion .
The preliminary results of the Congress 's investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast .
Last August , the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon 's general inspector , which was included after complaints from CENTCOM analysts .
Lt. Cmdr . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon press secretary , admitted in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment on Congress 's reports while the investigation into the inspectorate was still underway .
But he also admitted that 's experts sometimes well have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Department of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. ``
The investigation has repercussions about the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defence ) .
However , the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can leave to the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
The criticism of secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of information from more than 10 years ago , when a CENTCOM analyst , Gregory Hooker , written a paper on how the then-government under George W. Bush contradicted many analysts only a small crew force in Iraq and little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State .
Last year , the team around Mr. Hooker , according to government offices , notes that , contrary to the government 's statements , air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant implications for the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refineries operated to sell oil on the black market .
However , this finding was not published , the Times reported in September .
Centcom 's then commander , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticised by members of the legislature because of his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .

Destination records : who actually buys records ?
Lonely men 's middle-aged records .
Before rushing to the commentary to overturn him under the pseudonym non-selling men 's age with rough insults , this statement is heading from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-discussed resurgence of records is not on a boom in Millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but attributable to midlife nostalgia .
Those who recently bought a plate are all predicted to be aged between 45 and 54 .
In fact , the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
Nor is it hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs 66 per cent ) .
But do YouGov 's results vote ?
If this blog would be a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run amid a busy street in Soho , wearing a modest grey suit before I stand , keep my hands and say something definitely like : 'let 's throw us a closer look at it. ``
So , let us look at it .
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist business .
I would ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and trying to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I do from Sister Ray ( data count : two young women , three men 's middle age ) to the Reckless Records ( data number : eight men 's middle age , a woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the couple of hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
I 'm already appreciating , `` he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
These records , above pictured ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did n't follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
The reason why he owns such a significant number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now capable of buying records that he could n't afford when they appeared and once again buying items he sold when he was young and bust .
'Many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 , things I was probably too young to buy them , `` he says .
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone , adding : 'I do n't smoke and I do n't drink very much .
That 's my last .
WEZ , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes many customers he meets on the YouGov profile .
However , he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media , people who have heard about the comeback and prompting to buy again their old plates .
Of the talks I have led , people generally relented in 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy again their records , `` he says .
This would explain the boom to supporters of the record revival of a certain age .
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realise that record business offers a soothing community of peers .
According to WEZ , some of the older customers took push to the contactless payment system .
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar records , from objects that recall happy youth reminders .
I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions than some sort of consolation , `` WEZ WEZ .
That 's with me as a collector and I think it 's happening among many people .
It 's an easy way to deal mentally .
We 're like their social workers ! , a staff from a record stack .
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened .
The survey also found that 41 % own a record player they never use , while 7 % of those buying a record do not own a record player .
At this time of the news report I would presumably look very concerned while I leave through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men of middle age ) , has noticed a trophy aspect of the revival .
`` Someone only recently came here recently and said : 'I do n't own a record player , but I 'd like to buy a radiochead record so I can put them into the shelf , '' he says .
This is not a huge percentage , but it definitely happens .
More product , less music .
We have people who say I do n't have a record player ...
These are younger people , not older , who only slowly get in .
Fopp , which devoted the record almost an entire floor , has a bungled audience than I get in .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists who make the photographs , teenage and women of middle age .
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned businesses - Wild Beast 's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz browns from the loudspeakers - it 's good to see such diversity among customers .
None of them look particularly lonely , but nagging mental trauma are hard to determine when you 're standing alongside someone 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been running around in the business for some minutes and considers the variety of the records on sale .
She 's more likely to make a story stroll than a major purchase .
It does n't earn much , so the collection of plates is not a real option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It 's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... `` she drives with a lovely sigh .
I do n't know how I should explain it - it 's really unique .
My last stop is a business , which is believed to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban outfitters .
While I look at the appearance of patting the Jeans-Hottans , I watched a group of young teenagers who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player .
To the left , there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
No one sees them - perhaps because they are just purely decorative , some so top that it 's impossible to grab them .
It 's pure record art .
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more , there is nothing to complain .
It 's no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one who spends most for luxury items such as records .
Even though my investigations showed that the results of YouGov vote , they let them , at least in plate shops in Soho , leave the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record business and online forums .
These people are probably working hard in school or in offices .
They spend their Thursday tomorrow with certainty not with the strolls through plate shops of the Berwick Street and leaves through records while avoiding the startling look of an unruly , 30-year-old 's false presenter who appears over the shoulders of nothing middle-aged men .

Saving in the Moelfre Bay : three men have lucky yet to be alive .
Three men have lucky yet to be alive after being thrown ahead of their fishing boat before Anglesey .
The Moelfell RNLI rescue station suggested on Friday at 13 : 20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfrey Bay .
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength .
We saw how the boat turned near itself and put us the worst , `` said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones .
Happily , the strong winds have already got the boat except their reach until we let to water , `` he added .
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat , while the third man exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at a buoy without a bailout .
They arrived all on board the coastal boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said : `` the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky unharmed and still alive .
While the boat engine had an emergency row , this triggered , however , at the corner of the boot from the person who controlled the boat .

Reid says Clinton will remain in the case of an election victory at Garland as candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democrats ' presidential candidate , Hillary Clinton will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court .
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland 's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March .
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor of the late Justice Antonin Scalia .
Reid said Thursday during a phone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland with a degree of certainty .
A spokeswoman from Reid said later that he had not yet spoken to Clinton she would nominate Garland and he speculated .
He praised Garland and said Clinton 's team would n't worry for unrest with a new candidate .
Garland is the top judge for the U.S. Appellation Court for the District of Columbia .
Raid said Republicans were blocking the Garland nomination , were Lakayes and aides of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
He also noted Donald Trump was inappropriate for the presidential office .

Podolski picks up with gala after supercoup
Hakan Süchin is a football legend in Turkey .
In Turkey , an arrest warrant has been enacted against the former football star Hakan Sünt .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
For the first time after the coup trial , an important football game will take place in Turkey .
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski Galatasaray Istanbul around the supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : business as usual .
Even with the imposition of the state of emergency after the July attempt , the government pleaded not to affect everyday lives of ordinary people .
But this is not true for those suspected of addressing the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
It does n't stop before football as well .
Against the former Starkicker Hakan south , the prosecution provided an arrest warrant .
So the meanwhile in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sound to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed by state President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
While the state of emergency first imposed for 90 days until October , this actually has that on the lives of most Turks , but as well as no impact .
The nightly democracy guards on public places across the country have explained Erdogan on Wednesday for .
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan .
Especially fans of the working-club 's Besiktas traditionally do n't count to the president 's friends .
But what the bulk of the Turks unites in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military councils .
In this is where even even the fans agree - no matter whether their for Galatasaray or Besiktas .
At Cup winner Gala , it will particularly arrive at Lukas Podolski .
His sporting value posed the Cologne in the expired season proving : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31-year-old finished his first season as a top scorer of his club .
In the end game against Fenerbahce , he scored the 1-0 victory .
The newspaper 's fanatics cheered him : he was the best in the place .
He has completed the season outstandingly and secured his team to the trophy .
Thanks Poldi found the disappointing season for the record master a conciliatory deal .
After the runner-up K.o . in the Champions League , the lions also divorced in the Europa League early .
In the Super Lig , it just ranked six .
The season was n't good .
The trophy was the only way to win something .
That 's what we did and that 's the most important thing , `` said Podolski .
For champions Besiktas , the match year ran better .
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez , who put the base on the 14th title as a super-Lig goal king .
That 's also the reason that fans continue to hope to return the 31-year-old .
In doing so , the AC Florence under contract had announced only borrowed Gomez after the coup attempt because of the political situation in the country following his EM holiday .
If Mario wants to get to us , he must just say , `` quoted the specialist magazine 's chief chef Fikret Orman .
To do this , though , the striker would have to be ready to renounce at around a third of its annual alert , Orman clearly said : `` his salary at Florence ca n't we pay . ''

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschel is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisation .
Besides , she is social worker on the ground .
Since July , Annika Deuchel is the refugee officer for Urbach .
The social pedagogist supports the administration 's team around Achim Grockenberger .
She sees itself as a contact partner for all players : refugees , working circle refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else .
Regime customers from the working group suggest that volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there , the egg legendary wool milk which has mostly a problem .
That 's how some - less spotted than rather to the variety of desired assignment areas - meant when the administration wanted to tender the place .
Searched an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long-standing experience in the area of social work , just an emerging wool milk sauce .
But administration work is not her central area , means Annika Deuchle .
Above all , it 's about organisation , working with the people on the ground and behind the scenes as well as networking .
The 31-year-old has been involved for about six weeks .
It has a 50-percentage point to three years .
It was high time , says Regine Customer that Annika Deusche supports honorary and full-time players .
There are big and small problems , organisational , human and understanding problems .
Soon , new containers are standing in the Wasen Street
A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognised .
Local authorities are responsible for connecting accommodation .
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented housing rooms .
The cost of construction , rent or renovating these shelters must bear the local authorities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the land office to local authorities and job centres .
Problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his home .
The search has been designing for some time as very difficult .
De facto , the administration does n't find private homes .
So far , it does n't work on private homes , according to Deuschle .
Therefore , charitable apartments need to be enthusiastic as it means beautifully .
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasen Street .
But only with apartments it is not done .
Perspective is the cue , Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a fixed lead , there are internships , training agencies , school places , one-jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up .
`` More places would be good , '' Regine customer reports .
Many work in the bauf or help home companies , do not-for-profit work - and that motivates and very properly , as Annika Deuschle reports .
It hopes work for the community leads to a positive outfield .
This is not an employment therapy .
But activity does n't just think of work .
The day needed a firm structure , say Deuschle and customers .
People would have to develop a sense of belonging .
So it takes offers like sport , contacts with locals and , above all , language courses .
Professional courses are rar .
So here are administration and volunteers here .
It 's central that the refugees feel they were wanted in Germany and welcome .
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem .
They have to explain to the refugees that it will take it and they can bridge the time meaningfully , for example with language courses .
Who eventually developed the feeling that he could n't help in Urbach , should not be allowed to work and be unnecessary , which will never integrate .
The significant majority is motivated .
However , there are problems , though , says customers honestly , people who do nothing at all . `` The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others .
This is all already a mammoth task .
One difficult question : have the two after recent events fear radicalisation , even in a small community like Urbach ?
No , Regine Kunde said quite clearly what some naive likes . `` A restriction could be , but do n't want to exclude them .
However , the aides are already aware .
These incidents were also subject to refugees .
They would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely into disrepute .
They want to show that they have nothing to do with it , `` says Regine customer .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
So primary and volunteers will have to look for activities on the ground and in the region .
They always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach .
Does Germany need a ceiling ?
Clearly answering that question is politics .
Actually , it 's unfair to put them on the ground .
In Urbach , we have n't arrived yet where we would like , `` says Annika Deuschel .
No new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already being charged with integrating the previous people sensibly .
These are currently about 100 people , predominantly young men .
But if people are in distress , you have to help them , both women agree .
The political world situation is so complicated , as there are no easy answers .

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass fleeing
Who does n't adjust and praise Erdogan , sits on packed suitcases , `` says the chairman of the Gülen-New Foundation dialogue and world , Ercan Karakoyun .
The Kurdish community of Germany reckons in the short term with tens of thousands of protections fleeing from Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term , it could even become a few hundred thousand , believes the association chairman Ali Toprak .
Because of the tough approach by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
In the short run I reckon with tens of thousands , medium-term with some hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the Democratic opposition , `` says the Association of Association Ali Toprak of the World of Friday .
Because the government already overcame Kurdish strongholds with penalties months ago , 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey .
After the thwarted coup added secular and opposition ethnic Turks .
Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to suppress in Turkey .
It can not be that a state that includes even refugees produces refugees in its own country , `` said Toprak .
The association complained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in alert cities .
As a result , Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
They are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years , `` said Toprak , who is also CDU member .
The association 's chief called for the federal government to position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters. ``
Also in Germany , a witch hunt takes place against Erdogan critics .
I do n't feel safe in Germany in recent months for the first time .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will look for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition officials .
The fire mark as Gülen supporters destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence .
Who does n't adapt and praise Erdogan , sits on packed suitors , by the way , including the Kemalists and seculars , `` said Ercan Karakoyun , chairman of the Gülen near dialogue and education , the world .
As the newspaper reported , citing figures from the Federal Interior Ministry , the Turks already posed the biggest group of asylum-seekers recognised in Germany because of political persecution .
On the cut-off date June 30 , this were 11,386 people , and therefore just under 29 per cent of all as asylum recognised ( 39,625 ) .
This survey did not find themselves fled to war , poverty or perspective .
Asylum entitlements under the basic law are exclusively political , therefore by government side , individually persecuted .

The depressing meal of the economic crisis in a rich meal
In March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
As a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a fait for sophisticated delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup .
His menu this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato piracy and as a dessert a plum pudding .
It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , `` said Jane Ziegelman .
Her husband Andrew Coe added , `` It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . ''
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coes 's latest book Chop Suey acted from Chinese cuisine in the US , while brick man in her book 's 97 orchard has been told about life in a housing at the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
Her latest collaboration , a decent meal , will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publisher , illustrating the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg 's Sandwich Shop , a small , unnecessary snack at the Flatiron District , which has already been in business since the stock crash in 1929 .
Brick man , 54 , ordered a freshest cherry with olive pieces , while Coe , 57 , turkey with potato purges and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered reporters , this found this fitted the couple for a discussion of the food in the era of the Great Depression .
`` Rich groceries were very popular , '' said Ziegel .
There was peanut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
They were prepared from an ingredient and slightly cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners .
CoE grinsten .
It must have laid in the stomach like lead , `` he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all-y-can-eat buffet .
Teams of women cook for male field workers and it was served freshly baked paste for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War , a Square Meal distinguishes the pathways with which the country declined to be no longer the slate land .
It was a time when food for the Americans was a central , tense theme , `` endorsed Coe , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
Just as tense was the new budget diet : mysterious foods such as bread and casseroles have become basic foods , casserole rolling as a `` wonderful way of recovering food rests , '' noticed brick since cooks could hide unappetitive ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
Meat , which was years at the heart of the American cuisine , became a rarely served luxury .
Strange mixtures have been tried , as a calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
During her research for the book , which includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a court from this era , baked onions with peak butter .
It was n't a popular addition at lunchtime , `` says Coe .
Brick man continues : it was surreal .
Peanut butter and baked onions do n't fit each other .
It was typical for many of the home economic recipes .
As never before or since , budget economists - including Louise Stanley , director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - drove the country 's eating habits of this kind .
By releasing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become budget policymakers and to meet the challenge of turning pamper like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
A Square Meal is a festival of historic delicacies .
In particular , the reports of the government 's response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoover 's lass-mich-cake food stance .
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he dined like the millionaire man of world to which he has become .
He moved continental kitchen like fish with cucumber sauce , `` Coe said .
He in a nearly gilted dining room and wearing a smoking .
He was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife , Eleanor , called him to state an example with his stomach .
As described in the book , the hinters of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt carried out that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington but also one of the most prepared .
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was dismissed once the country came back on its legs .
The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel , as well as how science was applied to food .
The couple announced the book 's eating habits better understood the book 's eating habits - for example , like they could n't throw food .
She had a real fear of wasting food , `` Coe said .
Brick man recalled : 'you actually made people sick .
There was the wind plague incident .
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg , they and Coe produced a dessert which they had been preparing at home : the plum dessert , which President Roosevelt was attached to midday .
It is called Prune Whip , `` said Ziegelman , adding that it was an usual trick to miss a sending name .
There was no beaten cream , just plums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Everyone emerged somewhat reluctantly a spoon in the tough , brown glibbers .
Amazingly , it did n't taste bad .
CoE took three times an afterthought .
Like a Can-Do-Budgeter , he told his wife , `` A couple of hacked walnuts would help . ''

Raiffeisenbank Gmund at Tegernsee requires rich savers in future criminal interest rates - as a second institute in Germany .
Bank chief executive Josef Paul said Thursday : `` it 's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily accounts . ''
The Federal Association of Deutsche Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : ordinary savers would not need to be afraid to pay for their savings criminal penalties .
Camp banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty .
This fee requires Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over £100,000 to giro or daily accounts .
`` The first £100,000 are free . ''
The next 100,000 costs £400 in the year , `` Paul said .
He has been wary of 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could n't recover .
`` They are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent cost , '' the bank 's chief said .
I ca n't hint for every million 4,000 euros. ``
The cost he now continues after the polluter principle is now .
Letting the cash just be in the trespasses of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous : I have experienced four overs , I do n't want to get the fifth of them ! , `` the bank 's board said .
Most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
Few wandered to other banks .
The Co-operative Association Bayern said : the ECB 's extreme monetary policy course causes significant costs at all banks. ``
Carrying it alone is business permanently not possible. ``
Some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account , credit cards or transfers .
With criminal interest rates for deposits of three million euros , the Thuringer People and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with their Skatbank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kemmer , chief executive director of the banking association , said : `` we do n't expect private customers to have to pay coverage of charges for deposits , so the competition in Germany is far too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks . ''
A banker said there 's on the Tegernsee there 's been a clientele that is slightly luxurious from the assets. ``
This can become the problem for a little bank 's problem when they are wary of free money .
The 1911 Co-operative Bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach-Egern , Kreuth and Tegernese .
In the region , familiar actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live .
The Co-operative Association Bayern is currently not known any other banks that charge a replacement for deposits of private clients , `` spokesman seriously said .
The president of the Federal Federation of German People 's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken ( BVR ) , Uwe happiness , had explained at the end of June : `` the threshold , into negatives towards the private client , is very , very high . ''
The competition is hard , and it faces the migration of investors to competition .
Customers in Germany will not like that in the width .

Trade between Russia 's Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Russiness
With the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Levan Dzharyan , trade sales between Moscow and Tehran in the year , grew by 70.9 per cent .
Since international sanctions have been lifted against Iran , interest on the part of Russian companies at stores in the country grew strong , the ambassador told .
Russian companies are taking existing links with Iran , while new firms are ready to access the market .
Of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral collaboration with Iran , said Dzhagaryan .
He noted that trading sales between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 70.9 per cent compared with the same period in 2015 , and $ 856 million .
In particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 per cent to $ 158 million .
The trade recovery has been reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and guns , `` the ambassador said .
Dzhagaryan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
Last year , the Russian overseas representation admitted about 35,000 visas , primarily travel visas , an Iranian citizen .
In addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , affecting the number of tourists in Russia .
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken from last year , `` he said .
At the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
Personally , I can recommend the visit to the cities of Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd , who have received monuments of the old Persian civilisation in a good condition , `` he said .

Traveller Ian Wright scores for a travel guide to his tongue to the dirtiest places of Europe
A British traveller underwent his immune system and citizenship of a serious examination - by leaving some of Europe 's most dirtiest and most energetic places .
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk shadowed his train on a euro ticket , a railing at the Piccadilly Circus , a rink of a Zugtoilette as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system .
Before the divergence of each object , he used a luminometer to show us and what he will enter .
But the experiment , which was filmed under the title : The Lickhik 's Guide to Inner Strength , brought some surprising results to daylight .
The thought of disconnecting the flush of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely repellent , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen ring .
On his trip through Europe , Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about promoting bacterial bacteria as well as about his own health .
Fortunately , nothing left what he dismissed , more than a bad afterthought in the mouth .
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
From public railings to station stations to rinsing toilets , the job put his immune system definitely under a sample
In the film , he told : `` already as a child , I was relatively uncomfortable about what affects my health and I 've had all kinds of things put in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film , he was definitely fair to his reputation .
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
His trial showed a luminome number of more than 4,000 units .
In comparison , the luminometry number is freshly washed hands less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to strip after their luminometers were over 4,000 units while freshly washed hands one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film The Lickies Guide to Inner Strength , which shows the bacterial number in different locations such as the bathroom
In the film , he says : `` this comes the worst of what I 've smelled in a toilet , close . ''
There 's nothing more dirty than that !
I 'm going to leave nothing here because it 's indoors here .
The Lickner 's guide to Inner Streggth was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio .
The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus , which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bacterial bacteria and the immune system .
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` we wanted to provide really something new to consumers .
Something that is fascinating to watch , while at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics .
We led crazy brainstorming through which ended up telling Lass Ian to call .
They claim that interest is going to be a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it 's linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hakala , who led the film 's director , adding : `` let me say it like that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I have depended on him , like the echoed Russian toilet shown in the film .
Of course , there were things where it was easier to get Ian to cover them and others where this was pretty difficult .
I 'm glad we 've taken some of these dirty leaks on film. ``
In one of Valio 's 2015 survey , 84 per cent of all respondents associated milk acid bacteria , particularly with the welfare of stomach and intestine and 58 per cent said they at least occasionally use products that include attached milk acid bacteria .

Still , Volkswagen comes through .
Despite diesel scandals , extradition figures rise worldwide .
But not in all markets runs around .
In the recall action , there 's swirling about a term .
Volkswagen launches behaviour in the deliveries in the second half .
Europe 's largest automaker can continue to provide a plus in the previous year despite the diesel effects thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets .
But in July , the core brand VW weakened in western Europe , putting it back to the total sale , as the company noted in the Dax .
Worldwide , the brand VW sold in July with 449,000 cars 1.8 per cent fewer vehicles than in the previous month .
In Western Europe alone , to China the second most important market , sales were 14 per cent under the previous month .
In Germany 's home market , the deliveries slipped by almost a sixth .
Brand distributor Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
In addition , in some core markets , by changing economic framework conditions , there was a buying retention .
In addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British vote to leave from the EU has also explained a spokeswoman .
In the US , where the exhaust affair escalated first , it also continues to be a minuscule .
Big supporters for VW is the Chinese market .
Overall , the mainly affected household brand of Lower Saxony continues to come by the diesel scandal anyway : after the first seven months , only an extradition minus falls from 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles .
Group sales chief Fred Kappler could continue to provide a sales plug from January to July .
1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust gas .
In Germany alone , VW calls 2.5 million cars to convert into the workshops .
In the wake of conversion , VW reaffirmed that the reconstruction of the cars has no negative effects .
After converting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , carbon emissions or engine performance .
The automaker presents customers after converting a `` guarantee certificate , but do n't speak of a '' guarantee , as opposed to corporate circles on Friday .
The reason is legal fine units .
The focus had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for revamped diesel models .
This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Department of Department last Monday .
Confirmed from the Department of Transport that there was this meeting .
VW has fully fulfilled the conditions of my investigative commission and the KBA. ``
Deviations of these are not accepted , `` said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , according to the ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption , carbon emissions or engine power after conversion , there will be no deterioration and have all type-approved vehicle values unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term 's guarantee but not as it did in corporate circles .
In the vast term 's guarantee , Volkswagen sees the possibility that , for example , customers could come into a workshop for example after conversion - and this could return to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
Even in customer interest , it is important to avoid the fact that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal comes to an uncertainty about possible warranty arrangements , as it does .
That 's why VU does n't use the term 's guarantee .

Rio 2016 : ROBEL Kiros Habt becomes Internet
Not always determine the Olympics or world records the headlines at the Olympics .
This shows the courageous appearance of ROBEL Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
In the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia is so slow that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images .
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the selection was selected .
In the social networks , Habte then became the viral internethit .
Indeed , the 24-year-old finishes with a lag of 48 seconds his forward and finished 59 place of 59 starters .
But it was more of his not exactly sporting figure that moved the attention of international media .
Why the 24-year-old nevertheless participates in the Olympics ?
The Ethiopians got a special starting law by the International Swimming Federation .
This is distributed to make swimming known in under-represented countries .
As most athletes run in Ethopia , Habte just wanted to do something else .
Preparing is all : ROBEL Kiros Habte makes himself ready for the big race .
Quickly , the first nicknames made the round .
Some media described him as a Robel of the Wal .
In terms of a 's welfare belonging , the English tabloid The Sun made with Dad Bod about him funny .
His time , he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds about the 100 meters free , playing no part .
Comparisons with Eric Eel were also drawn .
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney , the run of Eric Moussambani caused media attention .
Memorable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to take off alone in a lead over 100 metres of free style .
Frenetically , Moussambani was fired at the time .
The then 22-year-old learned only eight months before Olympic and had never gone for such a long distance before the competition .

Queensferry Crossing : bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the Norddeck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now associated with Fife .
It 's the first of four closures of the blowers closer to completion around each of the bridge 's three towers .
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 slopes .
The £1.35bn project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Economy minister Keith Brown stated the construction site today and was one of the first to get to the bridge from the country .
He said : `` this is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queensferry crossings .
We are all witnessing an engineering art from a truly epic measure of this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
Despite the bridge 's massive size and weight , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the adjustment .
Overall , nearly 79 per cent of the total bridge decks in their place and the last section of the deck are getting a concrete concrete for the deck today , meaning that the entire deck is prepared to be raised on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : `` the first closure represents a significant milestone on every bridge project .
During this fantastic project , the closure of forward-looking civil engineering .
After installing the last road section and its compound with the expanding northern turkey , we then had to close the existing gap on the North or land side .
This was reached by pulling the northern feeding bridge 700 millimetres south .
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
Massive as the viaduct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be drawn at a slope of about 3 per cent .
Thorny , as the tolerances to which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters .
Fortunately , everything was very good .

From the US supported troops say they again reclaimed full control of Manbij of Islamic State
Forces supported by the U.S. have reclaimed full control of the northern city of Manzib near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left in the city , a spokesman for the group said Friday .
The Democratic forces of Syria ( DKS ) come through the extraction of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried within the city at the moment .
They have freed over 2,000 civilians , who were held hostage by the fighters as hostages , Sharfan Darwish , with the DKS ally Manbip Military Council , told Reuters .
The city is now under complete control , but we are conducting just cleanup through , `` he told Reuters .

Greenlandai : the oldest vertebrae is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks are mostly just in winter to surface .
This shark has returned to the sea following an investigation on board the research ship Sanna .
He was born in 1624 and swimmed with good a 1km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland 's shark will only get up to 150 years .
Indeed , the Greenlandhai swim at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he comes on average just 1,220 feet .
Just when it comes down , the five metre long animals are accelerating to satellite 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robber .
However , this long-standing lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science , in any case , of a Greenlandhai , which could be 392 years old .
`` Madness , '' comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for vertebrae .
While the evolution biologist has long been suspected , Greenland sharks will become stone .
Only the evidence was missing .
Greenland 's sharks are hard to watch , after all , they live especially in the ice cream in front of the thinly populated coastlines of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they mostly dive on the surface only in the winter .
Researchers accordingly know about the lifestyle of Greenlandhais .
Her timeless pace measures them when they equipped six animals with a broadcaster before Spitsbergen .
Prey these sharks are still making : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a robbe , another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
Possibly they are chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice seas and search caravers who torture from higher water layers .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues are now investigating 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen picked up fishermen between 2010 and 2013 ahead of Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatches from the depth of the North Atlantic .
The smallest shark was just 81 inches long , while the largest 502 inches .
To determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the sharks with the carbon 14 method .
This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks , which included proteins will no longer be renewed later .
The two smallest sharks had strikingly had a lot of carbon 14 in the lentils .
Her birth should therefore be following the early 1960s , when nuclear attempts made larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
In the country with 220 centimetres of third-seeded animals , the lentils contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from nuclear tests , therefore likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
All the larger Greenland hair , by contrast , had normal carbon 14-foot quantities that emerge through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
Indeed , the carbon clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenhandhandi showed an age of 335 , while the record has been likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimetres .
That Greenlandhai females were only getting offspring when they are longer than four feet , was known .
Now , the researchers were able to assign length an age .
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of gender tire and his age was determined with 156 years , Greenland sharks with the propagation obviously leave at least one and a half centuries .
Even this is likely to be world record for vertebrates at the moment .
That such Methusaleme lives especially in icy waters is n't a coincidence .
Even the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenwall whose bacon on the neck put a 120-year-old harpoint top , was caught before Alaska .
Through low temperatures , frequently , the organism of the animals living there also runs on savings flames .
So they mature later - and ageing slower .
To keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly great .
Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than at a gram elephant .
Another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should be focused on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible , `` explains the evolutionary biologist .
By contrast , a very large animal should invest its resources into a long life .

Bomb Terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Multiple Dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand are in contact with the woman , said the State Department 's spokesman , Thomas Schnell , Friday morning .
She suffered cutting edge and had been treated at the hospital , but this one can already leave .
Her home trip was scheduled for early September .
Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket , as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens , were still unclear for now .
The State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , according to school .
In about 200 kilometers south of the capital , Bangkok , Hua had initially exploded two bombs on Thursday night in a nightclub .
In doing so , according to police , a Thai child was killed and about 20 people have been injured , including the Austrians , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning then again took two explosives , with another person killed , according to the authorities .
A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning .
At the detonation near the popular beach of Patong , a taxi driver was injured after police claims .
In Surat Thani on the country 's southeast coast , another bomb then exploded , killing an urban employee .
The explosives went into the air , according to authorities in a flower before the area of coastal police .
Eventually , detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south west coast , as well as in Chmphom on the southeast coast , called for several injured .
You go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin , it said .
The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting , said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists .
`` We assume that it 's a coordinated attack . ''
It 's too early to comment on possible motives - probably handle , though , around the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
Thai police , on the other hand , said the assassinations were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or with international terrorism .
This is only local sabotage restricted to limited areas and provinces , `` said a spokesman in Bangkok .
Rather , the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta .
Authorities have received intelligence indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days - but they were not informed about the exact date and places .
Still , it 's unclear which group behind the attacks .
Police advised their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and pleasure quarters .
In Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they are usually not against tourists .
In Hua is a palace used for years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
According to the now bomb explosions , the Austrian State Department recommends its homepage , necessarily affording the instructions of Thai security authorities .
High security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla , as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding area .
After clashes between security forces and Muslim population parts , there will be no necessary travel in these provinces .
Increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the constitution prepared by the military junta .
This admits to the military 's great influence in the coming years .
Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , improving economic situation and tourism .
The military union , which had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , keeps itself benefiting the kingdom back to stability and order .
However , the military has also failed to get to grips with the insurgency of Muslim rebels for years .
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
Just over a year ago , in Bangkok , in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
It was the bloodiest attack of the country 's younger history .

Olympic 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught off : because of a positive doping test , weight leader Adrian Zielinski may not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official drug cases .
A caught athlete would have won almost a medal .
Before the seventh competition day , the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000-metre obstacle Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weight leader Adrian Zielinski have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions coming to the time .
At Chen , last Sunday , the Diuretic Hydrolothiadiac was proven to be used as a masked fund for doping substances .
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon .
On Sunday , the 18-year-old had finished fourth place in the final over 100m butterfly , only 0.09 seconds missed them the bronze medal .
On Friday , Chen should have participated in the precursors of more than 50m of free-style .
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) the opening of the B and a hearing .
The national association takes the matter very seriously and requires Chen full cooperation in the investigation , quoting Xinhua from a communication : we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict .
For the first time in history , it is no longer the IOC , but the CAS for sanctioning athletes with positive cases .
Also on the night of Rio , the news about the positive test at Danekova leaned through , the 33-year-old went into the offense himself .
I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , `` this was an incredible shock , '' she told Bulgarian TV station BNT .
She was innocent , `` the only statement could be food supplements , '' the athlete explained .
According to the report , the banned substance is to act around the blood doping EPO .
Danekowa has been preliminarily suspended , according to BNT , the B-test is also allowed to fall positively .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticising the athlete .
I do n't understand why the athletes do n't pull the right conclusions , `` he said : we Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been ruled out . ''
So about all the weight leaders from the chronically doping nation do n't participate in Rio .
On Friday , the case was also known to the Adrian Zielinski , the London-based Olympic champion in class to 85 kg like his brother Tomasz three days earlier tested positive on the anabolic steroid nandrolon .
Both deny the intake , but should not be allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
Before launching the athletes , especially the case of Danekova is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
The World Federation IAAF had banned the complete Russian team to an exception because of systematic doping the launch , including runner Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
In swimming sport , the previous offences in China had also provided fierce clashes between the athletes .
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt grabbed the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
Sun Yang pink purple .
When I see the podium over 200 m free set , I want to hand over , `` said Lacourt in French radio .
Sun was also at the heart of a clash with Australian Mack Horton .
I have no time and no respect for doping cheats , `` said this .
Sun was tested positive at the Chinese championships in 2014 , but had to seat only a three-month lock .

B27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
There 's nothing to mean by the speed with which the B 27 is sane .
For those responsible for the construction works , which start at 5.30am in the morning and only end up at about 8pm , there 's allential praise .
They 've done everything pretty zacking , `` told Elvira Tetzlaff of the Jet petrol station .
That 's a super super .
There is no delay either .
The building site could be relocated to the south at the start of the week by the end of October , everything is expected to finish .
It also praises the accommodation of those responsible for construction work , such as when it comes to setting up behind driveways .
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday , and also lifted the locking of the Asperstrasse in Ofterdingen and therefore the connection to Rottenburg again , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
Citizens can now be on both sides from oftendons from the B 27 .
The extraction traffic through the place seems to go back .
Since there was partially significant complaint , `` says the deputy manager Florian King 's responsible deputy management of traffic management .
Residents of Beith Street , Steinschargstrasse , Hafnerstrasse and Weiherrain had been fighting with more traffic noise because many of the cruises were looking for and more familiar to their navi than the signage .
What led to some trucks fractured in residential areas .
Since the speed limits were not complied with , the community increased the measuring vehicle .
There were significant excesses , `` says King , who made himself on the ground about the situation .
There have been two to three per minute .
The fastest was travelling with 77 hour kilometres in the pace 30-zone .
Since the building site has continued , but it has become quiet .
For businessmen at the B 27 , it 's only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburn , the street is now open again .
Business people are not liked to look into the cards .
But that the B-27 remodeling has resulted in revenue growth in them , leaving everyone you ask .
However , some are more and some less affected .
Anyone with the end customer has less to do , so for other firms , the clean-up has barely consequences .
Even at the automaker Maier , Thomas Sulz speaks of a `` maximum slight decline , but also acknowledges that , of course , the running story is missing . ''
The most battered are the locals along the road .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the steakhouse , foremost crown , finds clear words .
This is already an existential threat .
Not only him , but all the restaurants hit it 's hard. ``
There was a lack of customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil .
We have got to be happy about any euro sales .
The revenue loss is quanting on `` well over 50 per cent . ''
The roadblocks have dropped his operation by two years. ``
Half of his employees have had to dismiss .
If I had a company with 4000 staff and half would have been dismissed , politics would have responded differently .
Instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a question from Göhner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the reference to responding that the restaurant will otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation on the B 27 now , they also have to wear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation .
Göhners know from other counties where something like this has been handled more generously .
In all complaints , Göhner is sure to continue his restaurant .
After all , family operations have been located here since 1715 , pointing to the long history .
That other regulars now look less frequent because of the complicated traffic management can understand .
If you ca n't hear it , it 's beautiful even elsewhere .
The fact that his regular climbers come back after the end of the remedial work , Göhner has no doubts .
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , Göhner holds the impact of the B7 construction work on its clients for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant history in its longstanding story .
Six months of construction work , this is already brutal .

Despite doping : these athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already banned twice because of dopings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - whistleblower Julia Stepanowa may not start in Rio .
Other overtaken athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio medals .
The issue of doping determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics .
Russian swimmer Juliya Jefifowa , who had been charged with their starting law just before the Games , was mercilessly peaceful at her start ( 100 metres of chest ) .
It offered a wrinkly scene : with an established smile , she was still prouded into the hall and provoked with her appearance .
When they were not going to get gold , the audience broke into a jubilant storm .
But there are still numerous other athletes who despite doping past go to the start at the Rio Olympics .
Here 's an overview :
Justin Gatlin ( 100 , 200 , 4x1400-staffer / USA ) : the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics .
He was already closed twice because of doping ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
Since his ban , the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion runs even faster than before , he is over 100m in 9.80 seconds , the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challenger from Usain Bolt .
Shelly Fraser-Pryce ( 100 , 4x100-Staffel / Jamaika ) : the two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to serve a six-month lock in 2010 after her taking off the painkiller Oxycodon was proven .
She had strong toothaches after an operation , defending the 29-year-old .
Sandra Perkovic ( Discussion / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 , tested positive on the banned stimulant means of methylhey anaxanine .
Perkovic denies the knowledgeable income and was banned for six months .
The four broadest litters this year go on to the account of the big gold favourite .
LaShawn Merritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x400-m-season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400m , was positively tested in 2010 and blocked 21 months .
A means of penis enlargement was responsible , Merritt pleaded .
This year , the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m of the world 's fastest man .
Iwan Tichon ( Hammers , Belarussia ) : probably hardly an athlete have been renounced so many medals afterwards .
So Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was detected testosterone-doping .
The now 40-year-old also had to issue Olympic silver in 2004 because of testosterone abuse in 2006 .
The also acknowledged bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games received CAS because of a ruling by the International Sports Court .
At 80.04 m , it 's ranked two of the world 's rankings .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record leader and gold favourite was only tested positively in May , but may still start in Rio .
At the 29 year old world champion , evidence was found to include a banned food supplement , the lock of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and ran out on July 13 .

The US wins fourth match in the women 's field hockey , a showdown with Britain standing before
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women 's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0 .
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but Bam ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
I have no idea ... she said .
I 'm not among the people who retain their goals in memory .
However , they know the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British in the first place that remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals , the game will decide which of the two will gain the first and second place each within their group of six teams .
The first-place will go for the strong Dutch slightly longer , leading the other group .
Whatever the game on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising swirling through their success stories , four years after they landed at the past London Games on the last of 12 places .
BAM was part of this team .
She grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years of a hockey in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the US , the youngest in the team 's history .
She missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cadre .
Then came the year in 2012 , in which for her and her team , everything went wrong .
In the following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , trainer of the national team and things began to turn to better .
A culture change , a mental change and a physical change , said Bam .
We did n't have the workload in London that we have now .
We can have the rudder completely around .
On Thursday night , Bam opened the torrent in the first half of the game with a backhand from close range .
India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team showed surprising and kept the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands .
They fell a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then dropped into the middle and lups the ball into the gate around the Americans creating a 2-0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the US , Jackie Briggs , who has each had to book a goal in each of the previous games each .
She has a run .
Just like Bam .
We are in a good position , `` said Parnham , but well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .

Buyers in Primark outraged about women who tried underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers did n't know where they should look when a woman pulled her clothes amid a primark to try underwear .
To worsen the situation , she mustered how she looked at it , pulled her and put her back into the shelf .
They continued and tried four pairs of underwear in a business in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkstone .
The Primark business at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone , in which the woman tried underwear before she put them back into the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , she pulled herself again and left the business without buying something. ``
She said : `` people could n't believe what they saw . ''
In the middle of the sales surface , she took a pair of underwear out of the outage , pulling her own tights and pants and tried her .
She did n't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - they just stood there , cheeky like Oskar. ``
Everyone starred when they pulled the underwear again , which they obviously did n't like them as they put them back into the shelf. ``
She repeated the same thing with three other underwear before finally deciding that her nothing liked herself , attracted and rushed out .
She did n't disturb it that they watched someone - or think about the person who would buy the underwear in circumstances they had tried. ``
Mrs Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : 'how disgusting to think that someone would take underwear with home that has another person and who were n't washed. ``
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added : 'how I got to get the staff trying to pull the garments out of sale after they went - which is just as good .
I 'd hate it to go home with a new couple 's underwear and figure out that another woman has handed her and returned and they were n't washed .
A spokesman for Primark said : `` Primark is aware of the incident , which occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folkstone . ''
Any products coming into question were drawn from the sale .

Group rises in start-up for live video transmissions
Watching other people at playing video games is a huge trend - of which Microsoft wants to benefit as well .
The technology group buys the start-up beam , which specialises in this hobby .
How much money goes for the takeover , Microsoft did n't told Thursday .
Beam went on to start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
They can watch others at the game , but even intervene .
For example , they can give up the players missions and provide enemies as well as equipment items .
The player giant Activision Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports .
On the road to global media event , Facebook is scheduled to help .
The advertising industry is already horrified .
The start-ups , which has his seat so far in Seattle in the US state of Washington , draw to Microsoft 's headquarters in California Redmond , as well as beam co-founder Matt Salsacendi .
Therefore , there is nothing to change for customers through the taking .
Beam is being integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console , according to Microsoft .

Adblock Plus , Facebook in the cat and mouse game regarding advertising block
For companies earning money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circumvent advertising blocking , a cat and mouse play equals .
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocking on its desktop site , Adblock Plus published a blog place in which it told users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertisers to discover it displaying the detection of which part of the side is advertising .
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes .
In a blog post , the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that 's written this kind of battle between the displaying Open Source Community and the circumstances have already been underway since the invention of advertising blockers is underway , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's largest business for social media has left in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry .
Worldwide , according to a study last year of Pagefair and Adobe , use about 200 million people display blockers ; nearly four times as much in 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook over their mobile terminals , mobile advertising makes 84 per cent of advertising revenues Facebooks .
The company has on display blockers on desktop PCs , as mobile advertisers have no effect on Facebook 's mobile app for the social network and Instagram , a spokesman told me .
Advertising on desktop PCs makes an enough large proportion of revenues so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a move as worthwhile .
On Tuesday , Facebook told that it would update its ad preferential tool to have more control over people on them on targeted advertising .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that Adblock 's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
For the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , `` a spokesman told Facebook in an email communication .
Advertisers are a blunt resource , which is why we instead focused on development tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people 's hands .

Scotted Callum Skinner stormed home when Britons scored gold for cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner rasted last night in the men 's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that had his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had embraced the boy ... the boy made the legend proudly when he stormed home to introduce a victory from the favorites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while the fifth of six Olympic medals picked up .
They repeated the trick after picking up only a modest sixth place in March at the rail championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff .
They did so in time for a hind .
Hoys retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the Scot , which has now unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny - who win with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Zealander won in the first round .
And the British trio won the duel with gold .
Hindes were just back after his round , but Kenny brought the team to the front and skinner held it .
A strategy change made much of the transformation , where Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it and allow Kenny and especially skinners to keep the pace .
Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped skinner , Kenny and Hindes when these rose to the podium .
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said : `` it 's a flattering comparison . ''
I 'm just here to do my best and make me a name .
We set up an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions .
It was just incredible .
There is no better way to win this .
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys , Hindes admitted that after a weak start , he was intentionally on the track .
He later pulled this statement back and there was no appeal from England 's rivals .
In such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem .
Hindes said : it feels like the whole GB flags in the stands like London. ``
We have come together as a team in the last three months .
We have come so badly at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
This is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
If that 's a barometer of our progress in the last five months that expects successful five days at the Velodrom .
With the form Kennys is in the area of the possibility that he reiterates Hoy 's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger Hoy , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day there were also Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the one of Hoy equals .
Kenny is taking part next in the sprint , who will begin today and go over three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said : 'I only enjoy this for the moment .
The team event is always best .
You can win it with his colleagues .
It feels something lonely to win alone .
Hindes said : when he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to Knight. ``
It was the only medal contest of the day but there was further good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race .
They arrived at 3 : 51,942 at the target .
The world record , which won gold in 2012 , was 3 : 51.659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) takes place today on the second day of the competition , where Wiggins will certainly be in focus .
He had argued with representatives before the qualification yesterday when him calling for officials to measure his body size .
In the relevant women 's contest , which continues and finished tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibal of Milngavie in World record time in 4 : 13,260 .
The GB team leaves its strong rail team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympic Games and pick up a char of medals .
After a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were downplayed .
It played dramas in the background , according to the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations as well as retiring sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
However , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom , it looks quite afterwards than the now legendary reputation of GBs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .

Condoms with Chilipud , fireworks promote Tanzania 's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuders .
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation , which had years ago , has intensified its promotion together with U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-legged method to protect their homes and crops without violating animals .
Previously , many spears have used to defend itself .
Friday is World War 's Day , which is devoted to animal welfare .
Since then we have developed that toolkit , we were able to watch a change in their attitude within these communities , with them much more confident that they can hold the elephants from their fields without hurting the elephants , `` the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell expressed in a note .
The first two steps include the illumination of the elephant with a torch and the bubble into a horn .
If he 's not deterred , a so-called chili cloud will be thrown .
Chilipuder mixed with it together with a fire body into a condom whose end is being turned up to the ignition cord .
When it is lit , the condom is bursting with a bang and spraying fine dust on chiluders into the air .
A touch quite usually already out to chase the elephants .
One last possibility represents a campaigner who shoots a gold fire plant into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany 's rasers need to adjust to the next generation speed knife : in different federal economies , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new lightning devices are being tested to effectively transfer paces .
The futuristically acting enforcement trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be deployed to accident points , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by police .
For example , at highway construction construction or sanitary bridges with temporary pace , there is often no needed infrastructure to provide there with a stationary speed limit for complying with the speed limit .
A permanent mobile build-up , however , can be too dangerous or elaborate .
The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient : his battery at uninterrupted measurement five days , the case data is transmitted over a modem .
With laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be captured over several marks .
Variable speed limits as well as passing bans after time , line and vehicle class can also be monitored .
In the high-profile condition you can move to supporters , according to manufacturers with each car with supporters .
For it to be not simply clouded , he is lowered in measurement operation , so the wheels in the armored and by the way also disappear .
In addition , a built-in alarm is expected to protect the flash of vandalism .
Since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic in different federal states and is now also used .
Foreign authorities are also flashing off with the new technology : recently France has down 100 pieces , according to an order of 150 pieces last year .

Supercup : Barca with worries against Seville
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is fighting Sunday about the first step in the first title gain in the new football season .
The Catalans join the duel around the Spanish Supercup against FC Sevilla , the replay rises three days later in Camp No .
The double winner must renounce in power measurements with the underlying cup finalists and ruling Europa League champion among others , who denies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
Moreover , Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing .
The German suffered a tape in the knee in training , clearing the question at Barca at least for now in favor of Claudio Bravo .
The Chilean International and Ter Stegren have been wagging in Barcelona for two years around the status as a number one .
Coach Luis Enrique renounced this so far on a clear decision and left Bravo in the league , but Ter Stegen in most of the rest of the applications .
Before the first duty of the new game , there is doubt at the Spanish master about the fitness condition of the team , which was humiliated on Saturday in a Test match from Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
Even at the 3-2 in trial against Sampdoria on Wednesday , Lionel Messi and Co. did n't really know yet .
Seville again has the 2-3 defeat after extension in the European supercup against Real Madrid , seeking the second triumph at the SuperCopa de Espana .
Barcelona is with 11 successes of the record winners in this application so far .

Old buildings , a few lime trees , between a remaining headband : the Rigar street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does n't work at first glance , but police include them to the city 's `` dangerous places . ''
Go along the road from east to west , coming to playgrounds , a fresh kindergarten and a biolage pass .
To the façade of a grey house , someone has been `` ugly ! '' Sprayed .
Opposite a Lidl , who is also to be demolished soon , is already being built : by 2017 , here is scheduled to create a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
Articles about this 's trendy district , as the responsible property company calls Friedrichshain , are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars .
Reason is the house with the number 94 once it was occupied , now residents have lease contracts , but on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and will be used for events .
Especially the Berlin inside senator Henkel had spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a tough action by police against the project , calling the area as a no-go zone for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
After the rooms on the ground floor on June 22 were cleared with 300 police officers , police were patrolling three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground , blocking parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
Meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the spaces .
On July 13 , a Berlin administrative court decided that the eviction was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers drew off under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents .
On this summer afternoon , the road works peacefully : parents are walking with children , people sitting on the pavement ahead of the houses in the sun , others are entertaining late .
In the immediate nearness of the house projects , a primary school and kindergarten .
Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in the Kief since 1999 , and Jana * , who here draws three children , are mainly generated by the police presence .
With residents of house projects , they share concern about rising rents and gentrification .
It does n't sound like a kin , who wanted majority police protection from vandaling left .
The ditch , which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between home staff and their neighbours , does n't exist so apparently .
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class quarter , which also has a low average income and high risk of poverty today .
Also household occupations and the residential residential projects have long been part of the Kiez : in 1990 , numerous homes were occupied in the former DDR , including nearly the entire Mainz Street completely near the Rigaer .
While the mainzers had been cleared under large police bid in a downtrodden street battle , many of the projects in the Rigae were legalized and will still be inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago today .
At the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electorates from all over the world in recent years : with them , residents are now sharing residents from DDR times and former householders their kies .
This is also noticeable in rents that have risen by nearly 60 per cent since 2009 .
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : you acknowledge them on dropped slices or freshly cancerous facades thrown with colour bags .
No other road was mentioned this year along with the words of left-autonomous violence .
One reason that not all neighbors look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : offences such as body injury are aimed at statistics almost exclusively against police .
Most of the offences make property damage , which tends to meet new buildings and freshly renovated homes .
For Kerstin newbies , who have been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , ca n't be a speech from uncertainty .
As for violence , she is appeasing : people in the 94 are their neighbours who were n't determined to have been .
Even the famous burning cars are no longer admitting it directly in the Rigarter before .
For the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : 'here you help each other , live together on the street and get more of each other than else. ``
Newbreekers are deliberately pulled into the Riga street - and stayed .
That 's why it was also so important for residents to get their road back : from the police , politics and the media , who all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the neighborhood in July .
But in the eyes of residents such as newbreeders , the road will continue to take them away : through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that oust the old residents .
These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well bettered , `` she says .
Violence and destruction can not accept absolutely. ``
But what are you supposed to do when one never listens to anyone ?
It sets frustration on all sides , including with police and residents .
For travelers who are annoying about colour bombs , Kerstin newbreeders have little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the kiez .
Anyone herself should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a pub quarter , can complain badly about noise there .
All of the people imagined with front-runners have been asked not to be named with their right name

Donald Trump concedes UNK huge problems in campaigning
The leadership of U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to lose their majority .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republican strike Utah .
A rare moment where the normally large-scale and confident multimillionaire expressed anything like concerns about how correspondents reported .
Having thrown 16 rivals within their own Republican camp , the doubts are now growing on his success in the battle for the White House .
We have huge problems in Utah , `` said Trump in front of evangelical Christians , which he called for support in key federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
The fault was false reports of his candidacy , he took his well-known media place again .
Republican strongholds
Utah is usually a secure bank for Republicans .
A poll from Surveyusa from June said Trump and his competitor from Democrats , Hillary Clinton , were the same .
Other institutes see Trump forward , but not with the distance common for Republican candidates in the state .
As endangered , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
In an interview by the station 's CNBC , Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the rise of Clinton 's again : 'as much as I have done so far .
And afterwards : this will be either successful , or I 'll make a very beautiful , long holiday. ``
He does nothing else to tell the truth .
If it does n't enough for him for reasons of political correctness , that 's fine , Trump said .
Then I return to a very good lifestyle .
According to press reports , Trump 's party is to have threatened to remove money to support his campaign , should he not be able to present better poll results .
Instead of wanting to strengthen the Republicans ' candidates for Congress .

Berlin / heavy : poll before country elections : SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states , Mecklenburg ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) are characterized by significant losses for the government parties and CDU .
This resulted in representative polls of the opinion institute INSA for the picture newspaper ( Friday ) .
While the red-black government coalition could continue to govern in the north , this is not possible after the poll results in Berlin .
In both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to ask the leader .
In Mecklenburg , the SPD crashed 35.6 per cent five years ago to 24 per cent .
The party would only be just before the CDU , which could come back to 23 per cent .
Third place is controversial between the left and the AfD .
The left would come to 19 per cent ( previously 18.4 per cent ) , which AfD would be represented with 19 per cent for the first time in the country 's Day .
The Greens resume despite slight losses with 6 per cent ( earlier 8.7 per cent ) again in the Schweiner Land State .
NPD and FDP would n't represent 3 per cent in the county each .
According to Berlin 's deputy selection , the survey would just 23 per cent ( 2011 : 28.3 per cent ) .
The CDU just reached 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent .
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.6 per cent ) , but before the left with 15 per cent ( previously 11.7 per cent ) .
The AfD would be represented with 14 per cent for the first time in the House of Deputies .
With 5 per cent , the FDP could hope of returning the pirates , by contrast to 2011 missing the entrance .

Better traffic flow on motorway tracker
It 's regularly on the bypass road - here 's a picture of November .
But that is meant to change : the regulatory lane is to be extended .
This is good news for all car drivers who are in careers on the environment road every evening in the traffic jam when they drive over the highway - ( 43 ) .
The national operation of street construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the downhill Weseler Street the legal track at 700 metres .
Motorists then can thrive directly from Hammer Street on the right .
The big advantage : traffic shares early on , improving the total ­ expiration on the much-driven section of the Bundestrasse 51 .
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district 's representation of Münster-West .
The carriageway on the feet nervously needs motorists especially between 17 and 7 p.m .
Working days range from the back to the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond .
Reason is the needle turn on the B 51 just before the downhill Weseler Street .
From here , traffic is only steered over the highway bridge .
The second track had to be rebuilt before three-quarter years ago .
The reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge no longer owns the required vigour to include , especially , heavy traffic traffic dual .
How long this bottleneck and the related workable congestion will last , the relevant national operation can not say .
However , with years to come , because the bridge has an official remaining time between now and 2034 .
For the extension of the legal backlog , the country 's operation deliberately selected the traffic weaker time in school holidays because of disabilities .
Traffic will be passed at the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .

'A generation protest in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters who call for political changes in Ethiopia encountered violent resistance to the government .
Witnesses say that time protesters were killed during clashes with police in firing changes .
Is Ethiopia straight together ?
Over the past decade , it was one of Africa 's most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy .
But in recent months , protests against the government have been the country and expanded into increasing numbers of areas .
Last week stormed thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
The government 's response was ruthless , according to human rights organisations .
Witnesses said policemen shot and killed on unarmed protesters .
Circulating videos about the protests , which are presumably from the last or the beginning of this year , show security personnel beat young people with sticks while these were forced to make a handset against a wall .
The head of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now requiring an incoming investigation .
It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult , `` said Rashid Abdi , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorist riding over the region , especially in Somalia , only a few countries in Africa , if anything , get so much Western help .
Ethiopie 's economy expanded at the considerable pace .
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commute train in the capital Addis Ababa .
The streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissidents effectively silenced .
Many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the expansions of the desert .
But that could change .
If you suppress people and these do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia .
All of the youth protests .
A generation protests .
There are numerous complaints covering everything from ground use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the opposition 's last seat and now control 100 per cent of parliament .
At the same time , tensions rise along the border with Eritrea ; a fight around this trapping , controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogadine 's National Liberation Front , which has been more or less forced in recent years , exploit turbulence and could arm again .
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness were now exploding after years of getting in front of the surface under the surface .
The first seems harmless : smartphones .
It is only in recent years that very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have been increasingly frequent and improved internet services .
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which they do regularly , particularly in protests , many people can still communicate over internet proxies that hide where they stop .
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two biggest ethnicities in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since eons , the Amharas , who are mostly Christian highlights , have been prospering in politics and the economy while exploiting the oromos , many of which are Muslims and living in flat areas .
But that 's also changing straight .
We are in the process of coordinating under a screen , `` said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of the Oromos .
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the intelligence agencies , in trade and politics .
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was until his death at a non-publicised disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia 's prime minister .
He was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners .
Analysts say he was particularly savvy in it to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special envoy to edit opponents and make them unharmed .
`` The current regime is missing from this fundamental skill , '' said Mr Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopie 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegs , was selected for relatively obscuring reasons to take the position of Mr Meles .
Unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services .
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005 , after thousands protested against elections , which , according to data from analysts , apparently botched and subsequently stolen from the government .
During the following raids , many protesters have been killed , even if it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest went over relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuting plant , as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty .
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government 's internal miscarriage .
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month , protesters in Gondar , an amharic city , of Tigray 's business and the hatred towards the Tigray will be increasingly common in social media .
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position .
The American government used Ethiopia as the base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia , even though they recently told them that it closed this base .
While the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
This , said Mr Abdi , is a very thin gratitude .

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
The 27-year-old defeated Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided final his compatriot and title defender Zhang Jike 4 : 0 ( 12,5,4,4 ) .
As a result , the World Ranking First picked up the Golden Grand Slam with successes at World Cup , World Tour final tournament and just Olympia .
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani .
The two Chinese have made it as expected into the final match and made the title among each other .
As a result , it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick up the individual title in the sign of the five rings .
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic treck was the former SVS legioner Ryu Seung-min from South Korea .
Ma and Zhang were leaving themselves on the plate alone , between the sentences and time-outs did not have any coaches at them .
They had withdrawn to the grandstand , leaving their protesters in the fair competition alone .
'The matches to here I played for my country .
In the final I play for me , `` had Zhang consistently said .
After the party posed gold and silver medal winners with the China flag .
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral .
Ma had really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set .
Afterwards , he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang from just a total of 13 points .
By the superiority of Ma 's developed , not the expected stirring match .
But nonetheless , were sufficiently breathtaking ball changes .

Woman in presumable suicide on Switzerland 's highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night .
Police witnesses witnesses after a woman was overtaken in the early hours of Thursday at a presumable suicide of several vehicles on an exercise .
The incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the Canton Vaud shortly after midnight .
A woman put himself in the dark in an act of desperation on the streets and were hit by several cars , police said in Vaud .
It 's obvious that a Swiss age of 49 , who was overtaken by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
She died on the ground .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , police said , calling on them as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
An investigation was opened , which is a logical step in such a situation , Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
Was a collision preventive ?
That 's something the prosecutor must decide , `` said Hofstetter .
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held to responsibility .
In each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that motorists will not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it did in the newspaper .
Last year a policeman of negligence killing was acquitted after she had overrun and killed a man who was laid on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014 .
The 22-year-old victim had drink and has become unconscious on the street , the court heard .
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went to a justified manner and that a man 's presence on the street was a `` completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation , the judge said .
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 .

Steel - Lightness for Deutsche Steel Industry
The crisis-backed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared an extra cost of millions .
Financial burdens , which the industry threatened from energy support , are off the table .
It remains in liberation from the renewable energy surcharge at the inventories for so-called equipment production in the German steel industry , said Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the West General Newspaper ( WAZ , Friday edition ) .
I 'm really happy that we could finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations. ``
The European Commission , therefore , initially had planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use gases from the block to power generation for its own consumption .
The steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year , according to the German industry association .
Gabriel told the WAZ there is now a principle agreement with the EU commission after talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks , falling an EEG-pay of 20 per cent .
But these are not going to be raised in the steel industry , too .
The IG Metal welcomed Germany 's agreement with the EU commission on standard production .
As a result , the status quo of the previous settlement will be largely enshrined .
Particular importance has Gabriel 's successful efforts for the steel industry .
In terms of our campaign 's stole , the future is this is the first step. ``
Others must follow .
Even in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are weighing , `` explained IG chief executive Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity since the 2008 financial crisis , and a significant price pressure .
Last year the situation continued , when the world 's largest producer country threw China on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel corporations price dumping .
Throughout this spring , the situation has relaxed .
For one , imposed import tariffs on import steel effect , to the other , the economic prospects in China have brightened up .
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
German industry industry Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday .
Most recently , prices were more likely to have stagnated .
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost cutting .
ThyssenKrupp latest wanted not to exclude closures of individual works .
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry in late 2015 .
In July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steelmakers remain cautious .
They produced with 3.4 million tonnes well six per cent fewer crude than in the previous month , as the Business Association told Steel on Friday .
After a short increase in May , the manufactured crowd now went back the second month in a row .
Since the beginning of the year , production is up two per cent below the previous year .
The association expects increased emissions in the coming months thanks to improved orders .

The association of Nimas and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
The club , Nima 's , allows young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
The class international of the Children 's House of Children has visited an idea of the award-winning play 's invisible house of the boy 's Theater Munster .
In the context of the Nima 's intercultural journey , 19 pupils between 11 and 15 attended the staging in the Little House .
Since the beginning of the year , the club has been offering the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Munster as part of this project .
Most of the class 's youngsters were coming between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German .
Thanks to the choreographers , the scenic pictures and video animations have been possible for them to follow the process nonetheless , according to the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
The club , Nima 's , founded by Dr Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel , and the boy 's theatre will work together in the coming match in the framework of a music theatre project .
From October to December , young people without flight and migration backgrounds between the ages of 14 and 20 are expected to visit professionally designed courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music .
Offerings for children and families in theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in planning .
The project 's intercultural journey continues .
Given the increased refugee figures , the club reckons with many classes that want to get involved .

It is constantly being screwed up in the name of combating terrorism .
After the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package .
But what has a toleration status to do with terror ?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation .
All of his proposals were politically reasonable to the Coalition Partner , says the Federal Minister on the idea of his new security package .
They do n't overcome anyone .
Other , further points would be discussed inside the parties initially .
I 'm also participating in that .
As an interior minister , however , he was located in results and on a 'achievable consensus within the coalition .
De Maizière has passed a little time after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
The falls for this , though , are all the more extensive .
Some is already known , announced : that a new security agency is to take care of the crackdown encrypted communications is not new .
Nor does Germany have to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law .
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities comes just as not surprisingly .
Partly , de Maizière launches a second run for suggestions that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and punish jihadists with double citizenship off the German passport .
This will be difficult points for the SPD , admits to the CDU man .
He does n't consider this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that does n't have any chances at the coalition partner anyway .
A few new ideas presented de Maizière as well .
They have it partly in themselves : it plans to speed up quick procedures for deportation and more opportunities to determine people before deportation .
Refugees targeted in the country are expected to check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review .
In tolerations for rejected asylum seekers , he wants some even worse than previously - such as those who commit offences or throw away their papers to cover up their identity .
Some of this is political and legally delicate .
Some are also still impossible and leaves questions open .
And on some points - during inequality of tolerated for example - the question poses : what actually does this have to do with security and terror ?
Yes , says de Maizière is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
But it does n't conclude , yes , that the assassins of Ansbach and Werzburg were refugees .
Moreover , given the high refugee figures , many people were concerned about security .
And things that people deeply employed now also did n't exclude even in campaign time .
Internal security is enormous in the focus .
Only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Wirzburg and Ansbach .
The uncertainty is great .
And yes , there are campaigning .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
In the past few days , it was high between the two parties .
Just a garden dispute over the federal police , then about a security ideas collection of some Union interior ministers , in which the residents `` leaders also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship .
De Maizière is also struggling here to be conciliatory tones .
From a departure from double passport , he did n't have anything .
We pacified the discussion in Germany .
Remodeling them is not meaningful .
And in a burka ban , he had constitutional concerns .
Whether its own package on all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually reasonable for the coalition partner , has yet to show .
There is something in it what could provide controversy .
But the SPD is also currently trying to profit on the issue of internal security .
Leader Sigmar Gabriel only signals cautious discussion readiness and says : `` the SPD is prepared to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . ''

Postal services rise in trading with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
The interest of other companies at the danger is apparently great .
The post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetStreet scooters as well .
In the short term , the group wants to start trading with the transporter .
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from next year , too , in the free market .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : the First Smartphone
Email and Internet in timeline : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communicator on the market .
The sequels dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
It was thicker and bigger , therefore it was n't good in hand either .
On the contrary , it was pretty knocking .
The built-in memory was initially eight Megabyte , which would be ranging for roughly two selfies with high resolution today .
An iPhone is now being delivered with at least 16 gigabytes .
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
For a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the internet age 's stone .
However , 20 years ago , the Communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at Cebit 's Cebit in Hanover as an office in western pocket format .
In fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , including by Fax , the Communicator .
Even access to websites was possible by HTML browsers , although agonisingly slowly .
A pocket calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
Pretty proud was the price : 2700 D-Mark , that is , about 1400 euros .
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was at 392 euros in 2015 .
No one could see in August 1996 that the communicator would become the start of the smartphone era .
Since then , it has been different .
The smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
The Finns ' mobile phone savings experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and wound up .
The market dominates providers today , which came all much later than Nokia .
Always and everywhere online , that 's today for very many people everyday .
In 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
Sold about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , were accounted for by its own 555 million pieces .
Global turnover with the devices is about 400 billion euros .
These include the well-running business of the countless app provider and the telecommunications company .
Around the smartphone has since created an entire industry .
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007 , then announced Apple chief executive Steve Jobs on Mac-World the introduction of the iPhone .
He promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communicator , easy to use by touch-screen .
Apple 's victory start , still today , the iPhone is the group 's most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , which dominated the market , had looked after .
They eventually disappeared , Blackberry has been fighting .
The individuals now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
The smartphone is self-evident 20 years after inventing .
On average , every German now looks 88 times on his mobile phone today .
We have to learn everyone to get the smartphone along time away , `` said straight Janina bullet , in the Siemens board for personnel .
Permanent reachability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .

Donald Trump explains his allegation Obama had founded ISIS was sarcasm .
Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the latest controversy on Friday that surrounded his campaign by saying his multiple repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not be serious about the founders of the terrorist group of Islamic State .
This clarification accused new questions about the Republican 's communications skills , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public .
It also brings to his fellow campaigners who are seeking to take him into protection during an eventful phase into the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could n't mean at all .
After making the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday night , Mr. Trump returned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did n't intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
But in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic .
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day , where Mr Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation was perfectly serious .
When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted Mr. Trump to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know .
The latest storm of the criticism praises Mr Trump , while attempting to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling polls on the economic situation .
Mr Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump tried to return back to this issue .
Speaking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defence .
In late July , he pulled strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but explained he later said , of course , I said that sarcastically. ``
This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the language boundaries in politics and then return back to need .
I think it 's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then , if appropriate , clarifying depending on how the reaction is out , `` said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates .
But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways .
Rather than defying the tone for presidential elections , Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corroborative tone as his poll ratings have continued to decline .
A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a great advantage in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida .
While Mr Trump generally attempts not to apologise for his provocative remarks , he frequently accused his critics of distorting his statements or wrongly understanding his humor .
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's joke brought his loyal compassion into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how provocatively his statements may be .
Rudolph P. Giuliani , former mayor of New York and one of Trump 's most prominent advocates , gave great trouble to defend the candidate in a CNN interview Thursday today .
I think what he says is legitimate , political comments , Mr Giuliani said , so he was interviewed to the accuracy of Mr. Trump 's statements whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
It is true in this sense that before Obama , ISIS , was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called them backbenchers , completely wrong and therefore happened because he dropped the troops from Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed ISIS to spread by subjecting it to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East .
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them off on each of his words and being biased against him .
He derided the `` poor , poor television experts who try to understand him and said , '' you ca n't ! . ``
Some of the Democrats scored about Mr Trump 's apology as just another evidence that he was inappropriate for the president .

NASA climate model : Venus was once inhabitable
Venus was probably once inhabited by a new NASA climate model , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms resembling those of climate researchers .
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have once eating conditions with their hot , waterless surface and carbon atmosphere .
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earthy atmosphere and still turned slowly .
The model also lit the topography of early Venus .
The planet probably dismissed more dry areas than de earth , but had once enough water and geographic variability to host lives and protected fast evaporation .
Early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 per cent matter .
In the GISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exposes their daily side of the sun almost two months , `` said Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio in a news release .
This warms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which looks like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun warmth .
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
The model brought a story of Venus that resembles the evolution , which was previously suspected by planetary researchers .
Although she was once presumably habitable , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years - exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light .
Their oceans evaporated and their water steam was burned away from the ultraviolet light .
When their hydrogen emerged , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse -- the Venus , which as we know them today .
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Models in the Geophysical Research Letters .

28-year-old Key in San Francisco Mall found dead
A 28-year-old chef , who is recently drawn to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
The victim 's brother said he could n't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him , 'finally things went uphill at him. ``

Amid the rage of the Olympics , the ten of the trampoline
Wherever you are , how late it is , it 's the Olympics .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistent and inevitable , a rampant staff run between competition and pursuit .
It 's as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff , which is fed by the breakfast protection to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete .
You ca n't turn on the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour 's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there is still Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who is there for the first time at the Olympics and a woman 's swarm with greens , could have been well under those known names being sent to Prime Time , built through sponsors and feel-good TV advertising when he would be a swimmer , turner or even fox .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , struggles in the Olympic trampoline around .
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equal .
Further away from the centre , partly in the shadows , the sports that are not generally recognised are air pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwond .
We will always have the breast swim and may be long .
But if I likely make modest arguments for my certain darling , let me draw attention to the trampoline 's discreet charm .
Although trampoline jumping has already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , it has been so sparsely perceived the last 16 years that many of them , I had interviewed , did n't know it was any Olympic sport .
That could also be regional ignorance .
Although the US sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and by 2012 an athlete that made it to the final round .
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider low , in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unexplained ear for a close school than the one for the Olympics .
At this point I should admit that I 'm not an expert but only an earthquake enthusiast .
It has humorous potential - the cartoonage of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of the turn and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish el trampoline , which means as much as a springboard .
Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shooting almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a range of falling movements ( turning , Hechten and Saltos ) before landing on the feet .
They are being assessed , according to official Olympic programme after running , difficulty and flight flight .
Two-term athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will join each other in Rio .
The most common Olympic vector is straight .
Medallists need to go further in their pursuit of gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down in the playground .
They do n't just chase the finish line or the starting wall , but in television transmission also another goal : the world or the Olympics .
The targeted pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatical - and it 's enough to even touch a viewer to tears .
But it 's also what I recognise myself at the viewing of these games as something tiring .
This offers the trampoline a breathing space .
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up .
A forward movement is not the goal .
He or she collapses , apparently heavily like an astronaut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back up again .
Even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise , there 's no hectic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dreamy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
It 's so Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
Women 's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2 p.m .
Amid the Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one which is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult .
If the awareness increase can only be achieved by the angst and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner proposed recently , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his struggling , new fancy community .

Who is building Braunschwing 's favourable homes ?
The SPD and Greens think : investors are to be much more duty in the future .
How do you respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 favorable homes in the next few years ?
The SPD proposes a 's concept of action to the next council meeting .
But dispute is programmed .
First and foremost about the question : who is to actually build the favourable homes ?
So far , a settlement is missing .
SPD chairman Christoph Bratmann thinks : `` we agree with the Greens : who wants to build urban areas in the future 20 per cent of all apartments as social housing . ''
However , the favourable apartments can also emerge in the stock .
However , the big point in City Hall is , according to Bratmann : how to go around with investors who want to build on private areas ? .
We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas , but as much as 20 per cent of homes as social housing. ``
A new urban housing support program , which will cost millions and has yet to be funded , is expected to provide incentives .
The problem , according to Bratman : `` there 's no agreement between the groups at the moment . ''
The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible .
The left still wants tough conditions for investors .
Regardless , according to Bratmann , a tightening of the situation on the housing market .
If the action concept is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in construction management .
More staff is needed .
It 's unclear whether we will get the professionals .
But the program is still not altogether : because the around 1260 new homes should be built anyway .
But how do you equal the loss of another 1300 favorable homes whose promotion will expire over the next few years ?
It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
To prevent this , according to planning spokesman Nicole Palm , expiring ties should be bought from the city .
Additionally , thought would have to be thought to pick up housing back into price returns .
This is possible in the Western City .
On one blow , the problem could be solved .
Because in the West Council , the year-end deadline runs out .
Around 1800 homes could pick up there back into the price of favourable homes .
Just : that 's wanting the owners , the housing companies do n't .
Because the number of social housing in the West City is being raised drastically again , removed from the target of so-called mixing .
A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few city districts is expected to no longer exist .
The Greens expect there will still be movement in the discussion .
Group chairman Holger Herlitschken thinks : for a broad majority , the CDU needs to be in the boot .
While this was focused on more construction places for detached houses .
But what does n't mean that a compromise can not yet be found .

Assistant doctors would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy hunt 's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted on an election declined to do it .
In July , Hunt plans revealed that the contract was forcibly introduced and said the NHS would be in a no-none land and would be damaging for any further delays for the staff and patients .
The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve care at incredible times .
DR Ellen McCourt , the chairman of the BMA committee for assistant doctors announced last night in a communication with : assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and be failing to treat all doctors fairly. ``
At just eight weeks still remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running .
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with the government on reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence .
That happened to the one promise that Jeremy Hunt only made last month about that his door would be open .
Jeremy Hunt now has to act , lift the imposition and address the concerns of the assistant doctors .
Should n't he do so , so the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work measures .
The latest strike in late April saw a respite of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 deadlines , as nurses and specialists were involved in granting doctors on the strike poster chain .
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
The BMA wants a better weekend wage for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , director of the NHS staff , asked the assistant doctors to end the strike .
Mortimer said : `` labour controversy does n't reach anything little , but are already overburdened teams and service providers and preparing the patients , carers and their families only worry , distress and interruption . ''
Over the last two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistant doctors and with the Department of Health as well as other ministries positively responding to the concerns about the guardian and whistleblowing .
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as sending , flexibility in training , additional training sessions for those returning from a professional time , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training leave and the gender pay gap - a sign of how seriously it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Health Department regarding compliance with the BMA in November , February and May .

Despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time , cycling professional Tony Martin does n't want to walk up .
I continue to keep the World Cup in mind , remain confident and fighting further , `` the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook .
He did n't have a statement for his miserable 12th place on sugar .
I 'm honestly struggling to comment on the time yesterday , `` Martin thinks .
He would have to calmly analyze what reasons had led to the debacle .
At the time World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin actually wanted to fight the title .
I 'm going to look at everything we have changed in recent times. ``
This is what matters my position , too , wrote the three-time temporary champion who lost on Wednesday to the 54.5 million more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara ( Switzerland ) .

Salzburg 's West Side Story with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the West Side Story , with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Julia .
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
A Musical captures Salzburg : the West Side Story , Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece .
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and met with the role of Mary a youth dream .
In the orchestra , the Simón Bolívar orchestra , led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel : this music is full of rhythm , he swarms .
We always say it is very Latin American .
There are a lot of Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
It 's a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say we really have Bernst 's music in our blood !
In this production , Bartoli plays an older Maria .
She remembers with hurt of her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
The role of Mary has always fascinated me .
First , because it 's musically extraordinary !
And then there would be Maria 's personality .
She says in her song : `` I feel pretty , oh pretty , feel pretty and witty and bright . ''
So it 's wise , of course , naive , and very passionate .
She resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as a Roman , laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It 's such an honour for us to work with it .
She is an immensely generous person .
And Bartoli gives the compliment back : `` Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! !
Conducting is a necessity for him .
You see it in every one of his movements , in his looks , it 's his life !
It 's such a huge chance of sharing this musical experience with him .
We both have a more southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that 's very important at all !
For American director Philip World , McKinley is the West Side Story highly topical : this piece is about prejudice and fanaticism. ``
Today we have the refugees , then the Puertorians went to New York , and the New York residents did n't want them .
They are the same issues and they are just as meaningful today as they are .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Assistant doctors strike : calls for new work measures
Deputies from the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour measures in their disputes relating to a new contract .
The Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has called for its entire advice to approve more work measures at the beginning of September .
The JDC said it had failed ministers to worry about the contract .
Assistant doctors and medical students voted on rejection of a contract in July , which was agreed with the BMA .
He was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
In a letter to the members , published on Twitter on Thursday night , the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said the government would have been persistently quiet on problems , leading to the contract rejected .
She said : `` considering this , the JDC board voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official new negotiations to all your concerns . ''
In response to the government 's silence , the JDC board today requested a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour measures beginning in early September .
The disputes led to assistant doctors striker this year six times , the first overall outages in the NHS 's history .
The head of BMA assistant doctors Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA .
He told BMA members during the meetings that were still taking place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and adopted .
After the vote , Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly being introduced .

Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all that .
Dynamically on the spring .
Effortless on the beam .
Breathtaking on the ground .
On whole line brilliant .
And now , finally , Olympic champion .
The 19-year-old American Turner climbed on Thursday to multiple titles and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world all eyes under the headlights of the Olympic Games .
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and Final Five 's team cameramen Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina .
The Americans Simonen Biles turned on the balance during the women 's individual campaign finale at the 2016 Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multiple title and overall the fifth while consolidating her reputation , being the best of her generation or even ever .
She broke in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment an end .
This success puts them into the same league like unique athletes such as Michael Phelps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated the last three years of their sport , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises including a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said that she 's been `` the best turner I 've ever seen . ''
It expected a last examination in Brazil , a contest that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations .
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be seen as a disappointment .
The Americans Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace gold and silver in the women 's individual campaign final at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while she served on the farewell ceremony of the retirement team co-ordinator , Martha Karolyi , as exclamation mark .
Although Biles insisted , during their long way to the top , never having the future planned , it 's not really true .
Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical tumbling passport - is voted on Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympics in Rio .
That 's not a coincidence .
This girl , who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boormat 's mother during a school holiday in the gym , was trained in the Boorman became strength .
She has n't lost an additional contest since the summer of 2013 , a victory series that will last for so long as it wants Biles .
Even though Mustafina led easily through two rotations , the picture .
Sweeping beams and ground turbines - in which Biles hold the World Championship title - laughed .
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floor beam - and put one still on the floor with a 15,933 on the ground .
Raisman embraced them gently as she expected her final completion - a mere formality - and tears poured on Biles shiny red , white and blue eyeliners , when the vision she once described her in her collection book was to reality .
The performance of Raisman was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggled to third place , but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina .
This time , the 22-year-old team captain , which is named by the Americans grandma , had an advantage .
According to her ground exercise , she threw out to the audience , overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful .
As for Biles , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new importance :

Britain picks silver in 7-7 rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold
Britain 's impressive performance at 7-7 rugby arrived in the final Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the final hurdle in the form of Fiji , when it was beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji issued a master class in handling , side stepping , neighbours , line and raw force to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour .
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain 's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
The clear defeat of the boks , 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the finals .
But , regardless , Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form in this form .
It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fijis chief coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind .
Eight years ago , they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens .
They lost only here .
This slap will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks GBs out of fun .
It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were going to run in travelling buses ... the World Series winners went 5-0 up , when Osea Kolinisau rebounded in the corner .
With still four minutes of season , Jerry Tuwai still added another attack from the right corner he converted .
12-0 and GB hardly covered the ball .
A heavy tackle from Mitchell stopped stopping the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal , but it just stopped Fiji .
In the seventh minute , JASA Veremalua in the right corner was a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new since the replay and there was still over a minute of season ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou presented by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gateway .
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break .
It 's like Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learns .
That 's how it is .
GB conducted fundamental changes at half-time by and concluded the Fijian gap ... . for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half well until Josua Tuisova gone through Fiji after a brilliant interim play .
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB , made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 , but the game has long been in favour of the Southern Seanslaner , whose fans sweated flags and danced on the gallery .
It was n't hard to admire Fiji 's playoff approach .
Mata Viliame set this in items with another attempt in the final seconds .
The pepper , the Fijis embraced and GB damningly beaten into the lawn .
Earlier in the day , Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a narrow semi-final match from the race - Britain 's transformation of the difference .
Kyle Brown brought the boks in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team , secured the gain - and therefore the silver medal .

An American court judge decided that Gilead Sciences is entitled to refund the legal costs that emerged from the Hepatits C legal battle with the pharmaceutical company Merck Co Inc .

Mother of a 6-year-old with microchepic : it 's going to be better
Like most 6-year-olds , Edmund Picciuto loves the singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
But like the least of his ages , Edmund microcerchaly , the result of a genetic disorder , over his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did n't know during her pregnancy .
When he first came home he was my first thought , I do n't create that .
I do n't create that .
I did n't let that .
What 's not true at all -- of course you have left on it , `` she said .
Her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund can never realise them in circumstances and that he may not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far as to propose to institutionalise him .
`` My first answer was I did n't know that people still do , '' explained Picciuto .
Edmund can run with the help of an aid .
Edmund could not sit down or crawl until his third year and he can still not speak .
But he is slowly progressing .
He can walk with support and bike riding .
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund for 'Please sing me something about it. ``

But it 's not a typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some signs alone .
Microcerchaly has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the zikavirus during pregnancy .
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
It 's too early to say how it will affect the lives of those with the Zikavirus infected .
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
What will happen ?
And she still does n't really know .
I have n't asked for a long time after the forecast because I do n't expect someone to really tell me .
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus .
It will be better .
You know it will be better for you .
You 'll love your child and your child will love you .

Community , Spirit , Health : singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already accompanying her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in teaching studies she finished the complete music , and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior chorus .
Singing moves me - emotionally and physically , `` she describes .
After a sample , she feels balanced , happily and overall , she says .
By the way , she does something good about her health and spirit .
Because singing is right from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hackler of Deutsche Seniorleniga .
Most seniors sing in the chorus and share with equalisers the pleasure of the music , describing Hackler .
Through the regular connection , seniors can make social contacts and maintain .
For frequently , social and family structures are solving age , a chorus then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her chorus : 'to organise and organize yourself to leave on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of combination. ``
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense , means Hackler .
For this is where seniors train a deep and controlled breathing .
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs also does n't get out of the puste every day .
Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice aged , singing is an optimal hobby .
On older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula Lenz of the federal working community of senior organisations .
In older generations , common singing had a much higher importance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and recreation , she explains .
Lenz observes frequently that singing or listening to songs among older people raises many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time .
Through lyrics and particularly melodies , even demeaning people are resisting long back events .
When singing , the head is also demanded a special performance , explains Lein .
At the same time focusing on their own voice and on a predetermined rhythm and adapting themselves to the other singers - that 's a great cognitive challenge .
Just older people who live alone are practicing , not only to focus on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition you learn through the singing in the chorus , thinks Hackler .
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
Self-esteem is also growing through the singing in the chorus .
Showing yourself : if I long for something , I will be better and growing across me - strengthening that experience .
Good reasons to begin with the singing , therefore , there is enough .
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent advises Lenz .
You do n't sing alone - at 50 singing people , who 's listening already when a tone goes along ?
Looking for the appropriate offer , seniors have different possibilities , says Hackler .
Singing someone from the acquaintance group in a senior choir , you can just join .
Many cities are also offering overviews about the choirs in the area .
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the community or the church appearance .
Many senior choirs are also found over the internet .
If you have no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours are asking for help in the Internet search .
Who desires to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises Hackler .
Singing the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to any age .

Culture of Political Correctness leaves voter fraud in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on prompting a government report for corruption from office
A culture of political Correctness has meant that widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities will be knowingly ignored as a damning government report disclosed today .
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles attacks police , electorate observers and city halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of over sensitivities relating to ethnic and religion .
The former minister of integration and local government , which is now a corruption king , said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up shutout bands outside electoral cabins to protect intermittent voters .
He recommends voters should lead an ID to prove their identity in elections .
At present , one voter must merely call his name and address .
The report suggests that not remote ink on the finger of a person when they make their electoral votes to prevent someone choosing twice .
Whistleblowers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups .
This is not only serving against electoral fraud , but is also intended to protect the local government before the broader corruption and financial fraud culture , which is accompanied by it , `` he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London .
Last year , a special election court decided that the acting Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way , and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations .
Rahman is said to have his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the episode of an imitation where one person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
He was particularly alarming to the fraudulent postal ballot - at the elderly members of the Muslim community to pressure people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including leading expectations to prove the identity
In his report , it said : as evidence has been appropriate that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , particularly women and young people to vote , according to the will of the elderly , particularly communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds .
There was concern that ... state institutions have known such behaviour because of politically correct over-sensitivities regarding the ethnicity and religion knowingly ignored. ``
Sir Eric spoke of 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists editing postal election documents to stop polls .
The report , which is being considered by Theresa May , also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social fraud purposes .
Consider asking voters before the election , according to your ID .
Not removed ink on the finger of a person once they delivered her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
Systematic reviews on a person 's nationality to ensure they are eligible .
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic briefing .
Ban that political activists edited full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections .
The police are giving the power to settle shutouts around electoral stations .
A legislative change that eases an indictment of intimidation according to the Representation of the People Act 1983 ( People Representation Act 1983 ) .
Photography banned election stations .
Requirement that only English be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
Intensifying the training to ensure that staff rule that voters go to the electoral cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it 's amazing that according to the Tower Hamlet case , there was no criminal charge .
The electoral court has explained Lutfur Rahman and his deputies for corruption and illegal practices as unsustainable , `` he said .
He was pleaded guilty because of a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
He also criticises the impact of the electoral registration departments of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : `` the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal .
Our country , as the mother of parliaments , carries a proud heritage , but the worrying and disguised spread of voter fraud and denial of some authorities are threatening this good reputation .

Snapchat 's anime effect criticised as an Asian cartarian
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired , but some observers say it is insensitive to races .
With its filter tool , Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders absurdity .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are unsurprisingly , property tools that create more than 30 million improved selfies a day .
All missteps enter the public .
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused of promoting the app blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal .
When this week suggested a filter that gave them slits , false teeth and unseated cheeks , it called some critics a racist cartoon of Asians - being yellowed .
They asked whether these repeated controversy pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat told that it had disabled the feature .
The company offered an apology : the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians .
But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filter to injuries clichés .
Others declined the animated comparison .
In an email , Grace Sparapani wrote , a Korean-American art student whose tweet over the photos were widespread that the filter was `` violating and said to be uncomfortable . ''
She added that it 's difficult to argue with the opposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not yellow , but that the yellow face was drawn into the depressing extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling wires .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration battle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
And Snapchat 's great audience of young people - who are diverse in terms of breed as their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensibility .
If one of Snapchats filters generates a picture that is insulting for a user , it 's much more difficult for such stuff to stay unnoticed when it used to be the case , `` said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to extinguish her Snapching account called on others to do the same .
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she said she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticised the large part of white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
Either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so they can make such decisions , `` said Chinese-American Zhu , or they have people with other skin colours that are working there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comforting to say what to say about it . ''
Others share their opinion , a complaint that left Snapchat mostly unanswered .
The company does not release numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but , according to a spokesman , the company has recently stopped a staff leader who focuses on under-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Zhu said , for its part , that she will let her snapchat account be closed and added , `` I wonder if they need more users like us to say that 's not O.K . is . ''

The charges per cubic meter of wastewaters are starting from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the wastelance plant 's Neudoff / Reuth / Welschkehl 3.44 run for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.33 euros ( previously 2.26 euros ) and for Azendorf 's 3.64 euros ( previously 2.18 euros ) .
At the facility in Azendorf , the sewage charge will increase again at the latest , when appropriate improvement measures are needed .
According to an overturned calculation , the water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 per cubic feet .
As Mayor Bernd Steinheuser ( CSU ) reported , when approving the budget through the council 's Office of Culmbach , it was determined that undercovers were running for these sewers .
The Casent Village market was committed to running the facilities coverage .
From October 1 , 2016 , citizens , as well as the business and industrial operations from Welsh Kahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to grab deeper into the purse .
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 per cent .
As administration leader Herbert Schmidt pointed out the panel , a recalculation of charges for the market community 's wastewater plants was necessary .
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over-related undercovers were also offset from the previous calculation period .
The serious charge increases resulted in all three sewers plants around relatively small facilities with a very low sewage case , which lies between 6800 and 12,000 cubic metres a year .
So because of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be serious .
Moreover , sewers are easily declining in all three plants .
Furthermore , in the past calculation period , at all three plants were not last substantial because of its age renovation and repair expenses .
The facility in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Welshelle , Neudorf and Reuth , as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the wastewater Azendorf , the mechanical ventilation facility had to be exchanged because of a damage .
In the Pumpwerk Welchenkahl , the nearly 20-year-old funding facilities had to be overtaken by reason and , after nearly 20 years of operation , had to dig operations of the first plaintiff , the sewage mud will have to be disposed of and installed an extra ventilation possibility to adhere to the water rights guidelines even in the future .
Schmidt : `` these extraordinary expenses came from advanced care and maintenance costs to take into account accordingly in the new calculation period .
The same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
Stone houses made it clear that in the three facilities , the expenses for the operation and entertainment in the three plants were fully running .
In doing so , Schmidt , the market community of major entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years , remained spared .
The situation for the named facilities will continue to precariously remain precarious , according to stone homes , particularly since the utilities area of the sewage association Friesenschabach around these facilities could not be expanded because it 's about deficit facilities .

Kepler measures rotation rate from stars in the star clusters of the plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue at rotation rates among the stars of the star of the pleadays .
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in star clutches roar at different rates as well as in what connection the rotation periods are with the planetary creation .
We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the crowd of a star , his age and even the story of his solar system , `` said Luisa Rebull , a researcher at the Caltech 's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The star of the pleadances is 445 light-years from Earth .
Many stars in this star cluster , which emerged about 125 million years ago , now reach adulthood .
They are now turning themselves at the fastest .
To top rotation rates , these maturing stars encounter large amounts of stern winds .
As these winds travel through the stars ' magnetic fields , they have a braking effect on the stars .
When a star alters , its rotation rate begins to slow .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of every star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognisable star blow -- like solar stains .
The latest catalogue of rotation rates points out that massive stars spin slower than less massive stars .
Rebell compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning pirouettes than smaller .
In the ballet of the pleading , we see slow rotors tending to be more massive , whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars , `` said Rebell .
Since the star clusters of the Plejaden are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
`` The star cluster of the pleines offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions , younger and elderly , '' said Rebull .
There is still much in front of us about what we would like to know more about how the How , Wann and Why Stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their 'dance shoes .
Rebell and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports at length about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the pleadances , which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal .

Data clue : so perfectly blackened hackers their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware currently target companies - and are successful .
According to a recent survey by the malware defence specialists , Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America , Britain and Germany have been at least 40 per cent of the companies surveyed over the past 12 months , partly several times victims of an attack with extortion software .
In Germany , just under 20 per cent of firms were already targeting a ransome extortion .
Forty per cent of victims paid willingly the ransoms requested by the perpetrators to restore the attacked systems and data .
The offenders specialise in their extortion software , according to observations of malware bytes , watching attacks in company networks .
If they are successful there , the potentially extortion range falls significantly higher than in private users .
We are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the software , `` explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the world .
In 2008 , most malware programmes were still designed to send advertising .
Then the offenders discovered extortion software for itself .
It was not until private users were targeting , but the change to company attacks has been frightening quickly in recent months .
Ransowmare works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim actively , she is looking targeted after recently changing files such as Word , Excel or database files , and after archives of images and videos .
These files encrypt the Ransomware and extinguishes the originals sustainable .
Subsequently , the software presents the demands of blackmail .
To get the filing code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptown Bitcoin .
But where to private users the personal photo database is at stake , it is all about companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down .
Accordingly , the damage falls out when a ransomware increases .
22 per cent of German firms reported sales losses through Ransomware , 13 per cent even had to interrupt business activity , in one case , people were in danger of life .
In Germany , hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of nurses .
We are always telling the victims : do n't pay her only the problem , `` explains Kleczynski .
But 80 to 90 per cent of firms that pay , get their data again .
For managers , it 's difficult to reject the perpetrators ' demand in the face of standing in operation .
The hackers in turn know this and trying everything to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , F-Secure security researchers investigated the user interface and contact with the blackeners and come to the outcome : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
They explain their victims by chat as they can pay by Bitcoin , settle freely available support websites , or decide for free example files .
And are private individuals redeeming after paying for a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted .
Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail , the hackers are getting more professional and sharing the work , explaining security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sopos : `` a single person can write a ransomeware around within a week . ''
However , it 's more likely that it is three or four people .
Programmers sell their hazardous software then in the form of a software building box to the actual blackouts .
The previous malware kits were created by buying the Malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one-off , fixed price between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 .
In the delivery range is an adjustment tool , so smaller configurations , appearance and branding can be changed , `` says Wisniewski .
The extortion then searches for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
So you log into one of the forums underground , buying the set by a criminal and instructed another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
The pay is made per infected computer .
`` Usually the criminals then charge spammers with the spread , explains Wisniewski .
The risk of Ransomware is now known at many companies that better secure their data .
Over 50 per cent of company IT leaders in the Malwarebytes poll trust to be able to defend Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software .
Accordingly , the offenders already pursue new strategies .
If encryption of data alone is no longer an adequate threat to successful blackmail , the perpetrators instead face the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , `` explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Klezcynski .
As a result , the damage potential , according to the type of data , is still much higher than before .
Also , the offenders could take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
At the hacking conference Defcon demonstrated security researchers as they could get a thermostat associated with the internet .
In the middle of winter , the clearance of such a blocked heating so many victims could well be worth a ransom .
If the perpetrators then rather than heating in the future block a whole manufacturing road in a factory , Ransowmare could also become an issue in industry .

Frankie Dettori reaches on prediction his 3,000th win at Newmarket
Dettori springs champagne after a double at Newmarket , which brings him 3,000th win
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British gain at Newmarket on Friday .
He put on predilection , which will be trained by John Gosden , on his local circuit with his second profit of the night a landmark .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
The three-time winner Dettori , who won before Ghayaryar , said : `` it 's something special . ''
I 'm very emotional because my family is here too
I 'm very happy about it happening at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago .
It 's not a big meeting , it 's not Royal Ascot - it 's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I 'm relieved and very modest .
Dettori takes the jubilator when he picks up the victory on predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the nine-time Derby champion had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it 's no surprise that he has reached that milestone that few have reached before him .
He has style and strong , but it 's his tactical intellect that differs from the others in weight control room .
He 's a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charisma has been thrilling fans for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already picked up 6,000 gains if he would n't just be just a weekend and great tournament jockey !
Frankie has already ridden in GB nearly 30 years of winners , which is great .
He has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that , he is an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the hallmark of the British flat race for two decades .
It was nervous .
A whole range of big tournaments , including his famous glory Seven in 1996 in Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
Three years ago he had difficulty initially when he returned from his six-month lock but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form .
And he is far from at the end of the day - Dettori once said earlier that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50th years of life .

Tourists in Portugal panicked after a deep-flying military beach overflowed
Sunniers in Aveiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the air force put an incredible crash
The air forces said it was on a training flight but insisted that no security risk
This was the moment in which terrified tourists start to panic after a profound jet crashes over a full beach .
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew nearly in tangible close to the sunbathers on the beachfront in Aveiro in northern Portugal .
The holidaymakers jumped when they understandably started to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what came through the clouds on them .
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media , said : it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it were crashing. ``
Nuno Arroja added : `` I was just surfing and it felt like the plane falling on me . ''
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the aircraft came from darkness and incredibly low
Portuguese air forces today admitted that the pilot of the P-35 Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to detect them .
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual because of the bad visibilities nearby , but the air forces insisted that safety was not at risk of time .
Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on the island of Madeira came to death .
Portuguese air forces today admitted that the pilot had to fly deep because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoking , which limited its view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Clinton and Trump 's economic policy compared : it 's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - which wants both Clinton and Trump .
However , disagreements are the two U.S. presidential applicants in tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental issue .
The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is underlying a fundamental , more philosophical difference .
The one , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep the doubt more small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
He , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming Trump .
He will massively return regulations , and he makes for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , by contrast , says the state has certain responsibilities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it .
That 's why taxes for the rich would be increased , she says .
Interestingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
They have to be invested , saying Trump and Clinton almost worthless .
The Democratic applicant announces even the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
Government investment programmes into infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by Republicans ' state-owned wings .
So on Trump , partisan discussions could come .
Clearers are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ride coal production in the US again .
Oil production is also expected to be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris Climate Change Agreement he wants to terminate .
By contrast , with her investment programme , Clinton explicitly wants to expand renewable energies and calls for : one country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs. ``
It 's going to be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be it. ``
But not only in infrastructure - including in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
TPP , the trans-Pacific trade agreement , do n't want to sign both .
At the same time , however , both want the US not to isolate international trade - but just protect American jobs better .
They are then to be better paid , calling for about Clinton .
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 dollars is a hunger .
He wants to raise it to $ 15 an hour .
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not very clear : once , he says : the minimum wage must be running , then he says he should not be allowed to change .
But the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps .
On one side stands Trump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
His critics stick to him so that the budget deficit would only greater .
On the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants the rich to demand that they pay more tax , and whose critics say : more taxes are n't the solution either .

How to protect yourself with Krav Maga of gun attacks
The world out is a dangerous place , but this video of Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you .
We spoke with Rhon Mizraci , a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at near distance .
Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind you , this video will show you how you turn for your robber 's turn .
If you get closer to yourself from behind , then you should turn yourself first , so you can see your attacker and get out of the firing line , `` says Mizrachi .
Take the gun then between your front arm and your shoulder before beating him in the face with your free elbow .
Strike him then with the knee in the performance and twist you , while the attacker gathers together against pain , the gun from his hands , beating him with the run into the face and moving backwards while addressing the gun on him .
In attackers closer to front , the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line , take the gun and twist them , so the attacker ca n't shoot .
Shift at the same time the weight on the gun and beat the attacker on the chest , then twist the gun from his grip before moving backwards and targeting the gun on him .
Sounds difficult ?
Look at the video to see exactly how it makes Micraizi .
But remember it 's more secure in a room to hand your money - unless you 're not a Krav Maga grandmaster .

Cats react more sensitive than hangover on cries of young people
Biologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls from cat babys have on adult animals .
To her surprise , the mian also did n't get the males cold - but they always behaved in the difference to the females .
Female cats can recognize the emotion of cat babies at the middle of the little .
They respond to 10 per cent faster on lutters of kittens who were in great distress , as scientists have found out from the veterinary university and the Medical College Hanover ( MHH ) .
Hangovers are also responding to the cries of kittens - but always equal .
Apparently , the acoustic differences between the miaue of less and sharply hit young animals for the males either not perceived or not of importance , `` said biologist Wiebke Conerding from the MHH .
She is an author of the study published this Friday in the specialist magazine of BMC Evolutionary Biology .
In a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pit of kitten shouting differs with the urgency of its need for help .
Overall , we have been watched nine adult hangovers and eight kits from the livestock farming of the MHH .
They were played for a call of minors who were taken from the burs for three minutes and separated by mother and siblings .
At the same time , they were confronted with shouts of stronger kittens , which were additionally highlighted .
The researchers hold their results despite the small sample for meaningful .
All the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , responded differentiation on the cries , `` said conversing .
They turned up more quickly to the loudspeaker when this call of the more vulnerable kittens .
This ability may be born or developed with gender maturity .
`` A surprise was that the males have responded at all , '' the biology said .
In the past , scientists have already investigated responses from women and men on baby noise .
Again , some studies showed that women responded more sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the biologist Marina Scheumann reported .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through fight with the coach 's cancer to run inspire
There will be no more emotional gold than these games and that wants to hot .
From the first row to the last , 220 hard Hieve , who go into the story , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra significance at their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa .
Even though it was just the two that sat on the helm , there were three votes in the boat ... The echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present as she rushed to the second Olympic game in the two without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport that set off such a scale .
Their dominance was absolutely , after all , her 39th unbeaten use , which is also unprecedented .
What we see is two brilliant athletes who slide across the surface with the elegance of swans , which does n't reflect the kind of triumph all the time .
Behind each gold in the row , a battalion to willing helpers contribute to the incremental progress that make up the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did n't know about 30 months ago whether he would survive that day at all than was diagnosed with him cancer .
As he said he was risky .
I had bubble cancer , which is operational and they did .
If you do n't , he spreads everywhere .
It would have been a pretty bad situation .
It changes a little bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if this is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would enough .
That 's how it starts .
The rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
In the immediacy of the victory , their first thought to Williams , who spent an annoying morning spent something more than otherwise , trying to process his own anxiety .
Stanning , who was a principal in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan , said I was an emotional wreck this week , which is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much. ``
It 's repeated just how much me meant how much I and Helen and Robin worked .
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin , we would n't be anyone , so a massive thanks to him , he is the best coach in the world .
I would n't have a better person to train or want a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race over the last five years .
The couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could n't keep up .
Even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were very captured at the moment .
Helen called `` remains in the process , remain in the process . ''
It 's really important not to get involved .
We had a good start and at the same time we were not about to make something Tolles .
We did n't want fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go beyond and win the race , what we did .
The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glover must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall .
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did n't want to say that was my last race .
That would have too much pressure .
In London , it took around six months to realise I 'm an Olympic champion .
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
It took about four minutes here .
It feels so much better than that , `` she said .

The right 's identical movement is targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
According to several local offices , the constitutional defenders in the federal government have also placed the group under observation .
We see at the Identity Movement 's claims for aspirations against the Freedom Democratic basic order , `` said Constitutional Protection of Democrats Hans-Georg Maasen of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
So immigrant Islamic faith or from the Middle East is defamed in an extremist way .
That 's why we are now watching the movement as well .
The identifier movement is a grouping with French roots that have also been active in Germany since 2012 .
She turns against `` multicultural watch , '' uncontrolled mass immigration and the loss of his own identity through overcrowding. ``
Constituencies in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Berlin , Baden-Würtemberg , NRW , Sachsen and Thuringia - are already watching the identities .
Maes said his authority voted closely with the landing offices in the decision .
Groups like the identity movement are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , `` the constitutional chief said .
Generally , extremists are trying to address them with adolescent language , often with popper music .
This would be Islamists as well as legal extremists .
This is not a betul advertisement for its own thing .
The propaganda is expected to address people emotionally .
Young people are there in particularly vulnerable .
That 's dangerous .
Most recently , it had been given reports of contacts of the identities to AFD politicians .
Maes said he did not have any findings .
For constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point .
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people who are extremist to change their target direction and become so extremist .
So determining is whether such people have tax influence on the party .
This is not recognisable .
With a view of the significant increase in legitimate offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters , Maes said he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context .
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures .
There was the group 's Old School Society or Friday group .
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or small groups plan to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other far-right motives .
A Germany or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism , though , is not recognisable .
Previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Concerns expressed messages about the fact that many assaults went to the account of people who were not previously appearing in the right scene .
That 's worrying .
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene .
So many people have committed criminals who had nothing at all with right-wing extremists who may have politically indifferent or elected , for example , CDU , SPD or left , which then radicalised themselves through right-wing extremist mood .

Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led to low co-determination rights in the team 's decision-making process .
Alternative President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will look for a new coach immediately .
Over the last three years , I have met my duties as head coach and vice president of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , `` 50-year-old Roy in an opinion .
I reflected over the summer long and a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this requires it and bring it to a higher level .
To achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey operations must be perfect on the organisation .
He also needs to have a co-determination right in decisions that affect the team 's performance .
These conditions are not being met at the moment .
Sakic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked him for his contributions for the team .
Patrick informed me about this decision today , `` Sakic said .
We appreciate everyone what he did for our organisation and want him only the best for the future .
Roy was excellent during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as winners of the Jack Adams Awards as the league 's best coach .
He led the club to 112 points and in the first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the postseason in each of the last two years .
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39 brand in the season 2015-39 and fell behind the wild for a second wild-card spot in the Western Conference by five points .

Council rights centres show 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country 's most aid needs are dismissed annually by the community centres , while the industry has taken on the impact of further central cuts to already congested transactions .
In Queensland , there are already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for unjust delogues and the like - dismissed in their requests for free legal advice and legal advice .
Legal services to the community , which are already overlying , are making available for further cuts .
From June of next year , it is scheduled that these legislative centres will lose another 30 per cent of its federal resources .
The director of community law centres of Queensland James Farrell said the latest survey of the National Association of Community Rights Centers showed that thousands of people are already dismissed each year .
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a lifting of the federal government 's decision .
`` Queensland 's community centers are chronically underfunded , meaning that thousands of people are dismissed by important services you need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relationships , people with insensitive and crippling debt , families who go through separations , workers who were unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal and this survey shows they can not receive the help they need .
The federal government will cut the funds by 30 per cent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
We call on the General Attorney General and Federal Justice Affairs Minister , as well as senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these central cuts immediately , so people can get the help they need in legal problems .
Last year , the national government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
It is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their customer communities and that the Parasczuk government is investing in this important work .

For the overnight stays , parishes were available to the local parishes .
At the staggering targets , Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller caused a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast .
Further it went on the second day over furlong to Gütenbach .
Tags arrived at the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhausting route track , had to climb about 500 metres initially at initially and will resume afterwards .
The earned reward was a common barbecue at the Badweider .
After the morning punch at the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
Visibly relieved and happily met the minis later afternoon at the Freiburg Munster and stepping down the gates of mercy .
With a small impulse , God was thanked here .
In the supply show in Munster , the Minis arriving at the pilgrimage welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert .
After the service , pilgrims were able to visit the sacristes and the high altar .

Killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk around others : Khaled Omar .
He was the hero of Aleppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
He risked everything to save others life .
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a fiscal attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the White Helmets , a civil protection group that , according to pictured newspaper , saved just 60,000 people the lives .
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk of pulling people from bombed homes and first help in the war zone .
They are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the group 's face : a video of the civil protector showing him during a 11-hour salvage of an infant from the debris of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
It made the Syrians to the bright symbolic character in the gray of the war .
However , as a hero he never seen himself , saying , according to image : for me , this is the real Jihad. ``
When I die in saving lives , I think God sees a martyr in me. ``
Shortly before Omar himself fell to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
The helicopters have dropped four barrel bombs above the Alzadian district , one was filled with chlores .
A woman and two children died , seven people are suffering from atemnot .
We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that not children play with it , quoting the picture of his last words before he died .
The fatal bomb of the Assad regime should hit terrorists .

Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted for the Democrats ' presidential candidate and her husband 's income of $ 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 % .
In 2015 , the Clinton donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost $ 5.3 million in redemption rates ; the former foreign minister gave an income of $ 3 million from the publisher Simon 's Schuster for her book about her book at the foreign ministry .
Clinton 's candidate for the vice presidency , Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia , along with his wife , Anne Holton , posted his tax returns of the last decade .
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to put standards on financial transparency , `` admitted Clinton 's campaign held Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion .
In a stark contrast to this , Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreating in relation to his previous promises to release his tax returns .
It is common for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns , although they are not committed by law .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have indicated a tax review by the tax authorities as a reason for his denial .
They are on train , writing Clinton 's campaign helicopter Ian Sams on Twitter , in terms of the publication of the Democrats ' presidential candidate .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump 's special adviser , said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax exams are not complete .
Trump 's critics , including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , have already announced that his refusal raises questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its business and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already toppled on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high-ranking Republicans Trump urged his tax returns to publish .
On Thursday , she also spoke to the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . `` She said to the crowd .
Politico has reported that Trump has paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and an economic journalist at the New York Times quoted a series of tax advisers and tax advisers on Friday , who said that could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett , which would ensure that people would pay the more than $ 1 million earning a tax rate of at least 30 per cent .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has his seat here has Trump to exchange a meeting on their tax returns .
Buffett said he was also undergoing a tax review of the IRS and Trump has `` feared before voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax returns by 2007 .
The Clintons , which now live in Chappaque , New York , paid on average an effective federal rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
The tax declaration by the Clintons of 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of its income was referred to as a wage , unlike most of all Americans .
Their main money facility was a cost-effective index fund , from which the Clinton dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 taxed .

Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of touch this week about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot , which has proven to be an impressive double gainer of the Duchess of Cambridge .
But the 24-year-old Olympion is this summer by far not the only one to have gold fighting athlete who has its own famous doubles - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media .

Indeed , the archery got the madness in the social media and admitted he had already been heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
I myself do n't see a big resemblance , with the exception of facial hair , `` Brady told the Huffington Post .
He 's a guttering guy , so I probably catch this as a compliment on .
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly enter the center of this year : the dropped similarity between British vocal jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
Russian Turner Aliya Mustafina , with her big , expressive eyes , is expected to go through as a double singer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan .
And in the swimming pool , South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years .
A gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the athletic version of the inception actor

Theory in the space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the couple 's similarity
A Twitter user explained their satisfaction that the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical .

Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and their smile , which is nearly identical to that of actress Laura Linney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Turner Gabby Douglas , which has her own beautiful , broad smile that resembles that of Bring It star Gabrielle Union .

Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city at Main therefore in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg has the best chances of attracting from London 's relocated jobs and firms .
It 's very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote , says Michael Voigtlander , head of the IW 's financial markets and property markets .
According to the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether funds may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
For the so-called EU passport , they have so far been enough to admit in Britain .
These are just using large U.S. banks .
Several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
The lobbying agreement , Frankfurt Main Finance , expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
For Frankfurt , according to the IW , speaking to the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , combines responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the eurozone 's largest banks , as well as other major authorities such as European insurance supervision EIOPA and the ESRB risk .
In Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this one is less significant than the ECB for the financial sector .
`` Closeness to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , '' says IP Professor Voigtlander .
Luxembourg , while a large fund industry , cut as well as Dublin in infrastructure worse .
Frankfurt was much easier to achieve thanks to the big airport .
Also scored the city with easily available commercial properties .
In Paris , it 's not so easy to find free high-quality offices , `` says Voigtlander .
Additionally , the rents for first-class commercial properties are 50 per cent higher than at Main .
In addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
In a ranking of consulting Mercer , the city stands at seven , Luxembourg on No 19 , Dublin to No 33 and Paris in 37th place .
Even though quality of life is a matter of preference : `` with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , '' conclusions .
However , despite Brexit vote , London will remain in Europe , my business researchers .
The power conditions are also talking about : in London , according to figures from Landesbank Helaba in late 2015 , about 144,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , were 62500 .

Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is expected to be reduced to a back-office role , according to the bank 's chief executive .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the bank 's global ambitions .
The bank has since distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago .
During that time , brand strategists used RBS to protect other end-user financial brands .
She backed international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now she decided to put more national brands into focus .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all RSB references , the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will change to NatWest .
Ulster Bank 's brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other , smaller brands for retail business that will receive more importance - Coutts , Adam Co , Drummond and Holt 's military bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire .
He told the BBC Scotland with : `` the RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as to the brand under which our staff will be employed as we now become more to a bank of brands . ''
When the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became a global brand .
I 'm saying now that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals .
Each of these brands will be in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work under these brands with the customers .
RBS has already testified that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptions of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
It 's time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we inside ( we asked ) to do this to a better bank for customers ? `` The chief executive said .
It would have been very cynical three years ago when we said we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you 'll see a lot of changes .
We can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

Russia and Turkey : an alliance of outsiders ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
Russia 's leaders and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of the words and economic sanctions .
But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St Petersburg Palace , I ca n't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
There was the handship , yes .
But Putin 's smile was narrow and he hardly radiated heat , even for his restrained conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly from his dear friend Putin - according to a report entirely five times .
I could n't count it .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis , but will even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been so behaving like never happened badly .
It appeared to me his enthusiasm rather to indicate the opposite .
But one of Putin broadcast , sustainable cooling showed that the leader of Russia had nothing to forget .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the firing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was augmented .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia .
The offence was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend .
Rebuilding the venture will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , the state-controlled media led a fierce , unlimited attack on Ankara .
At once , it seemed the Turks were to blame for everything .
Most seriously , the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan 's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State .
He vehemently denied this .
But in St.Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan he wanted to hear .
Russia has been able to book a kind of victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly on hand .
Erdogan primarily needed all friends he can get after he was removed last month at a failed coup almost his office .
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there is economic motives too .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly banning charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
The number has dropped by nearly 90 % .
In Russia , travel organisers and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed .
They include a late-season rush to the Mediterranean .
This week , state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
A report in Vedemosti formulated as follows : `` tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow .
Ankara is furious on the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer .
This comes to the continuing resentment about the snap of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey 's relationship with the West .
The Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he called for support for the elected organs after the attempted coup .
That 's well noticeable for Moscow , which itself has a severe fear of regime change .
The summit in this lackluster palace on the seafront enabled it to Russia and Turkey , one as it once described me an analyst to depict an alliance of outsiders : two countries that feel violated by the West and feel badly treated and now allied .
Still , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacekeeper , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of first discussions , both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even striped the issue .
Turkey 's president avoided deliberately responding to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasise them .
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria .
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it 's certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other .

Why we Simone , Gabby and Laurie need
That 's what I present to me among the women 's olympics in the turn and this is for more than one reason .
First , I have been involved in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
And second : this team has three turners , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez , who worked inspiringly for many young girls of other skin colours .
The structure of this team , which Aly Raisman , which is Jeding and Madison Kocian , which is Catholics , makes everyone proud .
This team finally reflects the U.S .
It solided the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
Over the last four years , the number one among the female Turner was an African-American .
Last year , Simone and Gabby were # 1 and 2 .
That shows strength .
At the last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered .
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected , but masterful gym routines .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-championship event .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We are experiencing the tip of this sport , but so do n't look at getting classes across the country .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie struck all the same as Aly and Madison to create it in the Olympic team .
They are the last five because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team , and that 's that last year with Marta Karoliy as a coach .
But the reality is likely that turns are an expensive sport and Turner primarily continues in private turn clubs , which are being maintained by parents , which raise for the training , facilities , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their turners and families ) .
The majority of these turn clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
In these clubs , the Turner gets their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term engagement for the families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , coach of Laurie Hernandez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the guys .
We need to allow the communities of innumerable , young girls inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie , a more affordable and more easily accessible turnaround .
I founded my trial of 20 years .
At my events , we have trained free and affordable turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters ( especially black and hispan ) and trained national and international winners .
In September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high-quality guys who earn the possibility of learning and benefiting from this great Olympic sport .
Turns develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body , as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
This combination provides lifelong benefits to health as well as for school and professional success .
It 's the inspiration of this team to get thousands of young girls to get interested in the guys and that 's great .
It 's so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
That 's such an exciting time .
Thanks Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of Girl Power by the occasion of the Olympic team gold and thanks , back her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to become their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

Heavy rain , flooding gives cause for rescue in Louisiana , Mississippi
Heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to retrieve the emergency on Friday ... it is expected all Saturday over with more rains .
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisianas and southern Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains , the National Weather Service reported .
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and assisting the affected communities are already traveling .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the Governor 's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , announced that requests for flood vehicles , boats and sandbags multiple .
Steele said that alone , the municipality of Tangihapoa would have requested tens of thousands of sandbags .
A flood warning system is being used over long parts in southern Louisians through Saturday .
The weather service left announced that in this area , additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall .
A flood warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday , while in the area Mobile continues to rain .
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs , both of which are in Louisiana , will all probably reach record levels .
Meterologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge .
He also said a power-down flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these over the rivers will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas .
The river Tickfaw , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached on Friday at 09.00 the highest level ever recorded .
Rescue teams still cleared people from the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday .
Hansford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek , which is normally more than 400 foot from his house , increased sharply overnight .
He said he would have warned him another stepson who lives nearby .
We are woken up and pouring the water and pouring in , `` said Hansford .
It reached my waist .
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hansford said that emergency emergency rescued all three in a large military truck and they would have brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster where they were housed until Friday .
Krautmann said the flood was spreading quickly , as there were continuing severe rains and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions .
According to Krautmann , an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday tomorrow of 13.75 inches of rain .
Krautmann said the ground was significantly full by the rains since Wednesday .
The authorities said that severe rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and lessons in five school districts .
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a senior order in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded homes .
Residents were evacuated in two churches who have now both been flooded .
The municipality of the municipality of Robby Miller said the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed up by the flooding .
Shelters were set up in the cities and Hammond to host the evacuations .
Once the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , `` he said .
In the city of Hammond of the community of Tangipahoa , nearly two dozen roads have been closed due to flooding and provided sandbags for residents who hope to hold the water from their homes and businesses .
The last big flood we had was in March , `` said Lacy Landrum of the City Council .
This seems to be a similar incident .
In Mississipp , the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
According to his data , a handful of homes should have been reported flooded on Thursday , but on Friday , none have been reported .
Keith Townsson , manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
I 've seen water in places where I 've never seen it before , `` said Townson , '' and it still comes. ``

Building ground in double
With issues around building , the council has focused on focusing on the recent meeting .
With relief , the panel took the communication from Mayor Robert Plaz that will finally be able to start marketing the recently designated residential area. ``
After the property , parenting and development issues were cleared and the applications could be put on survey , the sale of the property in the residential areas of the residential area and Schönau-West ( area Binderstrasse - expansion section 1 ) is nothing more in the wake of interested parties .
The council is convinced that the construction spaces in the countryside and quiet housing community Schönau address young families and restful seniors equally .
As it said , construction volunteers can report immediately at City Hall , over the allocation of the parcels , the council is expected to advise in its September session .
To also ask questions about the settlement of other commercial operations , linked to job creation , the community council decided to change the land utilization plan in partial areas only in the spring this year .
For example , in the subject area , this will be extended there already designated business area around two parcels direction State Road in 2112 .

Pokémon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It 's fascinating to see how the world changed .
That teenagers and children do n't go out to games , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to rig on screens has been complained by many over the last decade .
At Pokemon Go , it 's about getting people off the sofa and becoming more active .
Time on screen was initially limited to the television , then on video games and more recently on smartphones .
So it 's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do n't exclude each other .
I obviously refer to the Pokémon Gown , an app based on the characters , which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a sign series , play cards and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , interest fell before the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
Market introduction in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded .
Within days , Pokémon had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , the players with their smartphones go out and search for Pokémons who are tracked with a GPS and , once they were found , can be photographed ( over a screenshot on the phone ) or can be captured .
A generation that played the game when they were even younger , joined the game and jumped for the search of the sofa .
In the US , the game led to a substantial rise in steps that return the average person every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch , which tracked 35,000 users , told the Washington Post post recently that within two days of market introduction of the game , the number of persecuted people who train 30 minutes every day , jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
The company does n't know who plays Pokémon Go - it looks only the raw data on performance increase .
Many public health campaigns , who want to get people to take 30 minutes to get off the sofa and to be active every day , met on deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and coming from people who look miserable .
Nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be overstated .
Anyone who regularly drives sport reduces its opportunities to disease cancer or depression .
Physical activity helps weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they 're fun .
Therefore , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people close on the hunt even new friendships .
As ever , there is also murky gambling spoils who always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could run against one door .
What 's supposed to be ?
It occurred a breakthrough .
Even if smartphone apps as Fitbit could already track our activity earlier , they did n't give us a reason to drive sport as it does this game .
The new will lose its allure and the use will leave with time .
Because of Pokemon 's success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world , while helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Flight : `` every fleeting woman has experiences with sexual violence .
Sexual violence is part of women fleeing alone , almost everyday .
When they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatised .
A house provides refuge .
In a large kitchen , four women sit .
Each has a baby , which is at best a year old .
One has put her little son in the arm .
He looks with great eyes curious in the room .
His mother stared on the table plate .
Until she notices that she is being watched .
She smiles and kisses the little .
The scene acts normal .
Until you speak with Katrin Bahr .
She is an area managing director of Condrobs , a carrier for social aid offerings in Bayern , and employs , among others , the issue of women on the flight .
The four women in the kitchen have fled .
They live in the Munich north in one of the few devolved shelters for their own women and their children in Bayern .
In January , Condrobs have made the establishment along with Pro Familia and Munich women 's aid .
Recently she was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
Men do n't exist - even as visitors .
The exception is a guard before the door .
It 's not exaggerated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight , `` says Bahr .
Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as hope to Europe , ``
At women outweigh other reasons for the flight : `` many steal themselves secretly because they do n't see another way out . ''
In their home , they made experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , honour murder , slavery or forced prostitution .
That continues it .
On the flight , that goes on .
That smugglers , for example , for a bottle of water call for a sexual act , is not a rarity , 'says .
And women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
Who believes that 's that once they arrived in Germany , mistaken , told Bahr .
Here , too , single women in refugee shelters would often be viewed as inferior and at worst abuse .
This means that about 90 per cent of women who live in accommodation in Munich North are traumatised , she estimates .
Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created. ``
Many women are so used to them saying nothing .
Or they do n't trust themselves to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big. ``
Since they often do n't know they would n't need more accommodation just for them , demanding bar .
In Bayern , the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees .
On the question of whether they know from a similar project as in Munich in their responsibilities , some respond with No .
About there is something like this in government accommodation .
Even in Swabs , fleeting women alone are not separated , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government .
In Upper Bayern , Underground and Central Francs there are in some community accommodation floors or their own homes only for single women and their children .
The exception is Niederbayer , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
The Committee on Rights of Women and Equality of Genders in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be housed separately by men .
In a study published for the committee , it said : it 's very important that men and women are being separated. ``
'Missing privacy or getting men and women together , it can be - continually - violence against women. ``
In particular , the laundries should be separated and easily accessed for women , standing in the study .
How much the women feel this need for protection can be read at the range that gives it to the house in Munich .
`` Since speaking around that there is , we have a long waiting list , '' says Bahr .
You could easily make up a second house .

French court rejects offer on demolition of business in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , where thousands of refugees live .
During a trial this week , the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to deflect 72 provisional businesses in which people within the camp , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that there would be a fire and sanitary risk .
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing figures in the camp .
They also led to the fact that the provisional business and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in distress .
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses , but conceded that the concerns of Calais 's prefecture were absolutely understandable. ``
The judge Jean-François Molla said that food businesses , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions .
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places threatened by the riot was the Jungle Book kids `` cafe of the camp , which is operated unnecessarily and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors in the camp .
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids ' cafe .
In a letter to the Guardian , it said the closure would be `` for these children of a disaster , of which the latest eight years old . ''
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of those in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - following a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer .

Disease case : when paying the organiser
Diseased holidaymakers get money back after their journey , when the cause of the disease is doubtful at the hotel .
However , that is only the case when more than 10 per cent of guests proved the same symptoms show .
In the negotiated case , a family on the second day of their Turkish holiday was hard for diarrhoea and vomiting .
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
Their disease caused the holidaymakers back to a defective treatment plant , which had allegedly polluted the seawater .
The family believe the trip was poor - and complained against the organiser .
In court , the plaintiffs had no success .
While the treatment plant was in fact defective .
But the organiser only learned before leaving the plaintiffs .
By then he had to assume that seawater was fine .
So he did not injured his information requirements , according to the verdict .
No contamination has been found in the water 's samples .
The disease of several hotel guests - perhaps by contagion - belongs to the general risk of life .
Of 691 guests , only 38 were diseased .

More than just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday .
In a room full of people I love brought me the sight of this cover to wine , `` wrote Kendall .
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar ? ) , crippled reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) , as they forget the cover of her sister and ending with a classic twist : they have all planned a surprise party .
This represents the cliché act nearly every birthday episode of a children 's broadcast ( Seacrest brought the sentence , `` '' you thought that we had forgotten you ? , with the honesty of a characteristic check on a broadcast at 8am in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity .
With regard to the September edition of Vogue , a new era of Kardashians began with security .
Kendall 's big sister Kim may have beaten them off the vogue cover ( she and her husband Kanye West were in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself .
September issue is the most selled edition of the year for Vogue .
With an extent resembling a picture band than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertisers ( according to Fashionta , from the 832 sides of the wood 's 615 pages of advertising ) .
The revelation of his cover star is seen expected to leak pictures of the magazine before the official announcement over the last two years .
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In recent years , clearly more celebrities have been modelling as a model , the celebrities are on the cover .
Oscar winner and Dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , after Lady Gaga had the honour .
But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the breakthrough model of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchap video ( even if it all true on Jenner ) .
They are really talented women who distinguished themselves in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the last cover , had with the publication of lemanoma one of the most successful years of her career .
Of course , Jenner 's success does n't like everyone .
With her reality TV story , Jenner 's position was always tense in the fashion world .
In June , the former Victoria 's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague , Gigi Hadid , criticised them and called her `` the pieces of the moment . ''
Those feelings cook again as the news with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover .
But on the mismatch appears to be past the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue .
She 's literally a supermodel .
She runs for Marc Jacobs .
It makes advertising for your grounding of Estee Lauder .
She and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps .
It 's sold of her made pictures of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to the magazine LOVE .
And in her leisure she is in reality TV , presumably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children .

Honda HR-Vis flexible and everyday life
In the small HR-W Will Honda will tackle everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivans .
Sounds quite overloaded , but the HR-V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves very flexible in everyday life .
Although the only 1.60 m high HR is small , passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the Fond , it does n't look tight .
The interior 's materials are well processed and acting pleasantly , only the cockpit top side falls something .
Versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at the storage room .
Not only is it a boot of 453 low at high-profile and 1066 litres at the reverse back opposition , but there 's the Magic Seats .
This is less magical than it sounds like : the seating areas of the return leave like cinema chairs and offer storage space , which is high from the ground to blankets .
The boot can be charged well , but the load is slightly higher with 650 mm than at the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 PS accelerates the HR-H thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large speed areas very powerfully .
However , he is likely to do a little quieter his work .
Pleasingly , everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
There is still another motoring : a 1.5-liter petrol with 96 kW / 130 HP .
A wheelchair drive is not being offered .
Driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between momentum and comfort .
The steering , however , is likely to be a little more direct .
The equipment leaves no desires open in the tested top variant of executive .
Security systems include the City emergency assistant assistant ( works to pace 32 ) , the collision warning system and the spurt assistant .
The collision warner is sometimes irritating because of ranking many obstacles than an approaching object .
Very reliable works the remote assistant .
And the intelligent Temporer responds to traffic recognition and threatens speed if needed .
However , there 's full connectivity , though , only for the top equipment : 7-inch touchscreen , Navi , app integration and more .
Two USB and an HDMI book are under the armrest and therefore are therefore something cumbersome .
The around £29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel are fine .
If you do n't want to invest so much , it receives the gasoline from £20,000 , the diesel from 23,000 euros .
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust .
With the HR-V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .

Trump does n't see the impending election defeat
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
Should it be nothing with the election to the U.S. president , Donald Trump already has an alternative .

A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in best days of base to base .
According to his emotional resignation announcement , the 41-year-old pro on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays will be wearing the jersey of his New York Yankees .
I love this game and this team. ``
I say goodbye to both , `` the 14-time All-Star Game participants explained to the Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Three times , Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signature under a 10-year contract has provided him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
By the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he acts in future as a consultant and youth coach - in full salary .
As a player , Rodriguez long paid back performance .
With 696 Homeruns , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( Runs ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones .
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two more baseball players in the main statistics show similar values .
But in the baseball 's glory hall , the 41-year-old is not likely to be included .
For such successful Rodriguez - nickname A-Rod - on the field , so disputed is his appearance outside the place .
Already in 2009 , the superstar at ESPN admitted to having banned steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 , he was banned for 211 parties due to an investigation in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered a prime suspect to have received performance-enhancing resources for years beyond an anti-aging clinic in South Florida .
After a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
The league could even be done for me for 2014 , because I 've played 20 years without a break , said Rodriguez at the time suffisant .
Even his farewell days are n't noiseless .
While many baseball legends are given the big stage in their last games , Rodriguez had to sit frequently on the bench .
'My job does n't include a farewell tour .
`` My job includes trying to win every game , '' etched Yankees coach Joe Girardi .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz , and representing the conditions with pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson , sympathies of the fans of the Yankee-Arrival Boston Red Sox .
We want A-Rod , sang the supporters at the 4 : 9-0 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

Asocial family destroys delogation of social housing in Saltash , Cornwall
An asocial family left her social housing after a delogism with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbours .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebiccock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash , Cornwall .
After being violently removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition .
The walls highlighted gaping holes on , wooden diets were torn up , rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was shelled to the walls .
The family have been resettled and it is believed they live in a private accommodation now
Donna McEvoy , who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing , said she worried that the home was no longer repaired .
She said : 'it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe people do n't have to live in this way .
There are a lot of things to take into account as this property is believed to be considered not so nice part of Cornwalls .
The family is infamous and their reputation it is also .
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and police said that terror , which had inflicted the family , included road fighting with baseballs , intimidating residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive screaming , disputes and curling .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name stood on the rental contract , got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June .
In some spaces of the house that will be demolished in circumstances , old rubbish was found
It was in the property in which drugs were traded in the past , the timber diets
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly had to call police
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner this week violently from the property after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to pull out voluntarily .
The delogist was cheered by facilitated neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
One said : `` they shouted around anyone . ''
We lived alongside them 20 years and it was always bad .
The countless times we say police here are incredible .
This morning we could n't sleep. ``
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that 's not used to !
Now where they are finally gone , it 's going to be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities .
The family lived in the house to which police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years
On the municipal side of the community house , rubbish and old toys
He added : `` it 's a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family as a delogism is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing .
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have been courageous with us and have provided us with the information .
I hope this development will donate some neighbor to comfort and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
A dirty mattress left behind in one of the house 's bedrooms after deloging on the ground
Workers of home administration will now have to waver off rubbish mountains that surround the house
In 2014 , police led a crackdown in the house and found over 70g cannabis , as well as scales , paraphernalia and cash amounted to £1,700 .
Skeldon received a fine after being familiar with the possession of a drug of class B in trade intention .
She claimed the money was for a tomb stone of her son , Lee Skeldon , who was killed in a car accident in 2013 .
After they were without a shelter , it will be assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
Many of the house 's room walls were covered with graffiti .
Police say they will delogize tenants who do n't get to the housing rules
Angela Crow by police from Devon and Cornwall announced that the delogue was a clear warning to the other tenants who do n't keep to the house order .
This goes to those who think they can behave without self-charges as well as to those damaged by such behavior , `` she said .
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

31 years exemplary for clarity
The managing director of the Water Purpose Association , Ruppert Göller , goes into retirement .
The association is considered a bay 's exemplary. ``
A small French drinking water purpose association as a model for the big water producers .
That 's how it said some time ago in the original in a contribution of Bavarian broadcasting .
Soon afterwards , the government 's water forum praised the purpose association .
The work of the Veitestern group applied bayerness as an exemplary. ``
Behind all this , Rupert Göller , who was 31 years in the purpose of staff , including 28 years as managing director .
Now he was passed into retirement at the age of 65 .
The drinking water purpose association of the village group , based in Kottendorf , community of broadbrunn , promotes about 150,000 cubic feet of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5,500 residents .
Member communities are the communities of church , breadth , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach .
For more cities and communities there are water deliveries .
The current chairman , Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert Göller stopped as a waterway in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the purpose association back in 1988 .
`` His tasks have been very diverse and they covered water construction and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculating fees and contributions to emergency responsibilities on weekends , '' the chairman said .
As outstanding events called them the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the rehabilitation of the high-containers ( 1999 ) , the re-creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and partial renewals of water lines .
There has been no standoff and you have repeatedly recorded innovations because water lives mean and drinking water the most important food .

Also , the supply of Newbrun can only be upheld because you filled the high-profile containers of Petton town with hoses .
The management of the drinking water association has been handed over to Daniel striker from Lauter , who takes the succession of Rupert Göller .

The £2-day drug to cut heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after being recommended by authorities to administer this more people for an extended period .
The polluting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
The medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
NICE 's NICE has long recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
NICE 's NICE has long recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of which suffer another heart attack or stroke .
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fatty material in the arterial walls , forming surfaces .
When the belonging breakdown , it can cause a blood island that causes blood flow to heart , causing a heart attack .
If the bloodstream solves , it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who had already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk one more .
Ticagrelor , which is manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and is displaced under the trade name Brilique , reduces this risk by making it more unlikely to educate blood islets .
The NICE 's guidance draft , which was published today , recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a twice daily income of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre , said : `` despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . ''
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person 's quality of life .
The experience shows that Tigrelor is in combination with aspirin effectively in reducing more heart attacks and strokes among people who had already had a heart attack .
By a preliminary recommendation from Tigrelore , we are delighted that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
The information about the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years ; the draft guidance does not recommend treatment that goes beyond that period .

What the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler expressed via Facebook to the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis .
In December 2014 , he first taken gold at the short race championships in Doha and at the same time posed his first world record .
Now , the former DSV Athlet Markus Deibler has placed via Facebook protection against his ex-teammates in criticism .
In a country in which an Olympic champion gets £20,000 premium and a jungle 's £150,000 , no one should be surprised about missing medals , `` the 26-year-old wrote on Friday on his Facebook page .
The funding system in the swimming sport is bad , while doping controls , on the other , were very good .
As a result , we ca n't compete with countries that promote very much and do not look accurately or even operate on the subject of doping .
I 'm not saying that the controls should be hired here , `` he explained .
If he wanted to start a comeback , Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start to the National Anti-Doping Agency ( NADA ) .
That 's exactly how you should keep it with countries as well .

Once out about the price from the market , café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg , in which only to pay cash , which had no Wi-Fi , but for 15 years serving good coffee .
Of course , it was pushed by prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front .
The business Soap Cherie , which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cupcakes .
Locals mastered it as the last loss in a gentrificizing city .
The artist Molly Crabpapable wrote on Twitter , `` I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CBGB dead , the Chelsea Hotel excluded and Verb is now a soap business . ''
But if New York is changed , it is also reinvention .
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint , less than a mile north of its original location .
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
The coffee is still good even .
The new owner of the is Cisco Rodriguez , a longtime staff member of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
He began working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end .
When he offered a customer to provide funds for a new outfield , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , reserved a lot .
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
He led new ingredients .
On the menu stand sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and saunted onions .
There 's natural bowls .
The cafe serves no more beer , for that there 's fresh juices .
After nine months , Rodriguez said he noticed a steady electricity of old regular customers .
Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg , he said .
Recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
Even after being drawn to Greenpoint , she would take the way .
After the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee drink , she said .
I was clear that it was in coffee and at the culture in the verb that I liked , `` she said .
Now she 's drinking again coffee , even if she ordered a bleed chai Chai this day instead of her usual ICED coffees , which is another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing .
I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter , `` he said .
Photograph Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu .
Nowadays , Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said he had no resentment over that the soap business has taken the old business room .
Indeed , the owners of Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the casual coffee of the cafe as ingredient .
I think we will still go on her offer , `` said Rodriguez .
And traditional , Polish residents Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe .
A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to issue them soon , so his new neighbours feel welcome .
The location also has other merits .
A local juggernaut wants to fill and sell the cold coffee into the bottle .
There is a chance the cafe expands on a neighboring building .
For many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favourites .
Joseph Witt was regular customer and said he was destroyed to the ground when the cafe closed .
When the new cafe opened , Whitt said that entering the local and ordering a new coffee feel like a home return .
I had to smell that , `` he said .

Jewish director smashes Berlin 's hotel because Israeli preselection was removed following Arab 's call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots removed a media result after betraying that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-selection as it requested Arab guests , according to an employee .
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah , left his trouble at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ .
During his last stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel 's pre-election list .
However , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
Wrote Lanzman .
Instead , Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel across its own Call Center .
According to a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The answer he received there , `` shocked him , as Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel resident said the measure was an intentional decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel .
The reason behind it triggered even more raging in the director .
Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the preselection be deleted , was quoted by Lanzmann 's employees .
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadassman called this a big shame , `` the Süddeuthe newspaper reports .
We were horrified and dismayed by this event .
That 's really very embarrassing .
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater disgrace .
That does not require any explanation .
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , `` the official said .
The incident triggered a pretty great resonance on the internet in which people called the whole a scandal .
Some understand the Kempinski Hotel that it had given up the alleged calls of Arab guests .
`` Ashamed you , '' they said in another contribution in which he was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kurfurstendamm , stands near a synagogue .
The hotel quickly pointed out all the allegations and called the incident an accident and apologised at Lanzmann , The Mirror reports .
There was never a direct statement to include Israel into the fast-track list , `` the Southern German newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski hotel .
It adds that the country 's preselection was now added .

Relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
In the evening , you 're loosing forever around , and at night you 're waking up for hours awake , tomorrow is already well before the clock rings can no longer be thinking about sleep .
That 's anything but relaxing .
After all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than 10 per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing .
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
There are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can underlie diverse causes , stresses Hans-Günter Week , board member of German Society for sleep research and sleep medicine .
What you understand running beneath , though , is the insomniac , that is , an entry and sleep disorder .
Just that 's sleeping many people as unsatisfying or inadequate , says Jens Wahnknett , board member in the German home doctor 's association with practice in the Lower Varel .
What is behind sleep disorders ?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex .
Behind this can put organic , mental or behavioral factors , but also drugs .
Not seldom is the sleep disorder expressing another disease .
'Very early wake up is particularly during a depression frequently , `` says Week .
And it may be that different factors condition each other .
Anyone who , for example , has a band disc incident , can be bad , waking up every two or three hours and possibly catching up on everyday problems and concerns , Week gives an example .
This leads to straining , and sleep is no longer possible .
From when should you get to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
Anyone who does n't sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights a week and on the day should go to the doctor , Wees .
Impairment can look altogether differently : one is tired , unassuming , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irritable , has sentiment variations or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches .
To alleviate the sleep disorder , it 's important to find out their causes .
As treatment options come under , among other things , behavioural changes , cognitive behavioral therapy or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets is only exceptional and at most for two weeks - question .
Lower-lasting sleep physicians are hardly available in Germany , stressing Prof. Ingo Fietz , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping centre of Charity University medicine in Berlin .
That 's why , in sleep problems , you should initially turn to the home doctor , counsel .
The can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should be into the bedroom , and what happens ?
To investigate in the sleep laboratory , physicians , for example , among snoring with breathing suspects , during diseased daytime fatigue , at sleeping wanders or when you do n't find the cause of a panel disorder , Fietze explains .
You actually do n't have to prepare for the investigation .
You should spend the day normal .
Just please do n't make a lunch sleep , `` says Fietz .
After the cable , you go to bed at his normal time .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , you wear a nose glee , a breast belt and a feel on the finger .
In addition , a camera on the ceiling highlights the bedroom .
How can subjects get to grips with the problems ?
There 's quite a lot of screws on which you can set for a better sleep .
White counts : regular sleeping and stakeholders , not too long in bed , do n't sleep on the day , not television to sleep , alcohol avoiding and not looking on the clock at night - then that 's quite and not conducive at all .

Russia 's Putin fires Stafford Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov has been part of Putin 's closest confidence circle for many years .
The 63-year-old was appointed special environmental and transportation affairs .
In an opinion of the Kremlin , it is that , without indication of reasons , Putin ordered Ivanov 's dismissal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration .
Anton Vaino , who has been Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is former diplomat .
Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , made his degree at the renowned state Moscow Institute for International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the message in Tokyo .
It says on the Kremlin 's website ( on Russian ) that he was later log chief executive and chief executive of government staff .
About his appointment , he told Putin : thanks for your trust. ``
I think it 's the government 's most important thing to support your activity as head of legislation and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
Convince the smiling faces ?
This move has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putins and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the KGB .
As a chief of staff , he was one of the country 's most powerful men .
At a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed the Chief of Staff will resign on their own desire .
But despite the smile for the cameras , only few are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
So here is the episode of a sort of power struggle ?
No one knows that at the moment .
But the official claim - that a man who was once being toured as a potential president , wants to guide Russian environmental policy at once - had great scepticism .
In his remarks to Putin , quoting on the Kremlin 's website , Ivanov said it 's true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to me to trust this very complicated post - you might nearly say - to trust an appealing post four years .
As it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov took the post in December 2011 .
Before , he was deputy prime minister and defence minister .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB .
In the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , who replaced the KGB , Ivanov was appointed to his deputy .
When Putin got to power , Ivanov called Ivanov as one of five people he most familiarised .
Once agreed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin 's second term , as a third term Putin had violated the constitution .
But this post was taken by another , almost ally Putin 's ally , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming the president three and a half years later .

Treats wants nude calendar for women and for men
The Treats magazine works with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017 .
But instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of top models for their muse calendar for 2017 .
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his naked magazine of Oldschool Playboys was distinguished , as Playboy was for men .
I do this for women .
Apparently , he thinks it does the calendar as well .
We need to return to the portrayal of timeless and classic nature , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , `` said Shaw in a press release to release the calendar .
Women will want to take part in this project because it 's a beautiful work of art .

England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and across London , but all over the country .
For me , this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows , just as it was then in 2012 in London when we run a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
The Olympics brought big benefits for Stratford and the East End .
And that 's going to get back by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow .
For our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blamed on the world stage .
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcoming , but Heathrow answers every question he asked .
Like the Olympics , Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £211bn of wildlife growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB .
We have a great team in Heathrow , which has implemented a £11bn infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , which was elected five years in a row to the world 's best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built amid the world 's two most frequented catwalks .
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk , which is supported by £16 billion in private investment .
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow 's expansion will also be one .
It 's time we draw this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment on which England can be proud .

GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
Consumer research company GfK exchanged its boss Matthias Hartmann .
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprisingly .
The difficult location of market research company GfK suggested that the chair of chief executive Matthias Hartmann will be all the more uncertain , the longer the successes they promised .
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK : after again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate governance , the global number five of the industry is facing a personal new start .
GfK board leader wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
The chairman of GfK 's supervisory board Arno Mahlert already divorces with effect September 12 from the supervisory board .
The leadership in the board is already taking place on September 1 , the previous board member , Gerhard Haus-Ruckinger , told the company .
He is to officially take over the function of a board spokesman until a successor was found for Hartmann .
As a reason for the resignations , the company called different views on long-term business orientation .
Details did not want to name a company spokesman on Friday .
Who will be leading the market research company in the future is currently still unclear .
In investor circles , on Friday , shareholders were most recently disappointed with the continuing restructuring of the restructuring launched years ago .
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011 .
But the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , `` they said .
Given the latest bad GfK business figures , every shareholder will eventually be troubled .
If this would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Quands so much , `` he said .
The company had not been able to halt its loss journey after setbacks in the previous quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .
With €361.2 million , sales were up 6.1 per cent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year .
Referred to the first half , sales shrank by $ 721.2 million by 3.4 per cent .
Profit in the second quarter has particularly impacted the company 's fallen value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
The company experience needed in the Consumer Experience 's business division of £139 million provided the corporation under the stroke a loss of £148.2 million .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GfK was still generating a group profit of 19.7 million .

Scout Callum Skinner storms home as Brite earns gold for cycling
Scotland 's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night at the men 's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio , when the British team defended the 2012 title .
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role his countryman , Sir Chris Hoy , had taken as his own . The boys ' pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to take a win from favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympiagold medals .
They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place at the London World Championships in March despite the resignation of Hoys .
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the starter Jamie Staff .
They did so in time as Hindes appeared .
Hoy 's retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close .
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but the New Zealanders won in the first round in the standard rounds .
And the British trio won the duel with gold .
Hindes were close behind his turn , but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it .
A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation , with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and to allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace .
Hoy looked aside from his position as a BBC expert , and Skinner , Kenny and Hindes appeared as they climbed onto the podium .
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said , `` It 's a flattering comparison . ''
I 'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
We have set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions .
It was just unbelievable .
There is no better way to win this .
After the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenny and Hoys , Hindes admitted that he was deliberately on the track after a weak start .
He withdrew this statement later and there was no opposition from England 's rival .
With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
Hindes said : `` It feels with all the GB flags on the grandstand like London . ''
We have teamed up in the last three months .
We 've gone so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
This is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London .
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Velodrome .
With the form of Kenny , it is within the scope of the possibility that he will repeat Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
This would be Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , who was also born on March 23rd ( an apparently sacred date for British sport , that day also Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
That would be the same from Hoy .
Kenny is next in the sprint , which starts today and will go for three days .
The 28-year-old from Bolton said , `` I just enjoy this for the moment . ''
The team event is always the best .
You can win it with your colleagues .
It feels somewhat lonely to win alone .
Hindes said , `` If he wins two more gold medals , he should be knighted . ''
It was the only medal contest of the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Bradley Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race .
They arrived at the finish line in 3 : 51.942 .
The world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 51.659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where Wiggins will certainly be the focus .
Yesterday , he had met with commissioners before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker , and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in World Rector 's time at 4 : 13,260 in the corresponding women 's contest that will be continued and finished tomorrow .
The GB team is relying on its strong railroad team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a host of medals .
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were reduced .
There were dramas in the background , including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amidst sexism and bullying accusations as well as the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
However , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome , it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GB , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .

Trump does not see the impending election defeat so closely
The Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
If it were not for the election to the US president , Donald Trump already has an alternative idea .
He just went on vacation .
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential elections in November , he would not care about it : `` Ultimately , it will either work out , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , '' said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC .
If , in the end , he did not succeed for political reasons , Trump said this was all right .
Thus , he designated US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton , founder of the Terrormiliz Islamic State ( IS ) .

One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan .
Sounds rather overloaded , but the HR-V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be very flexible in everyday life .
Although the HR-V , which is only 1.60 m high , is rather small in size , the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear , but it does not work at any point .
The materials of the interior are well-processed and pleasant , only the cockpit top falls somewhat .
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space .
There is not only a trunk of 453 l with raised seats and 1026 l with folded backrests , but there are the `` Magic Seats '' .
This is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinematical chair , offering space space that is 1,24 m high from floor to ceiling .
The trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height is 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very strong thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
He should , however , do his work somewhat more quietly .
Pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
There is another engine : a 1.5-liter petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
An all-wheel drive is not offered .
The driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
The steering should be somewhat more direct .
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant `` Executive '' .
The safety systems include the city emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the tracking assist .
The collision warning device sometimes irritates because it judges many obstacles as `` approaching objects '' during maneuvering .
The high-beam assistant works very reliably .
And the intelligent cruise control responds to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed as required .
The full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7-inch touchscreen , navigation , app integration and more .
Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore a little cumbersome to reach .
The around 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right .
If you do not want to invest so much , you get the gasoline from 20000 euros , the diesel from 23000 euros .
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard .
With the HR-V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .

Nor is Volkswagen going through lightly .
Despite Dieselskandals , the delivery figures are increasing worldwide .
But not all markets are running smoothly .
In the recall action , vortexes are a concept .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries more cautiously in the second half-year .
Europe 's largest car maker can continue to show a positive performance despite the fact that the company 's diesel engines are still operating thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets .
However , in July the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the total sales , as the Dax-listed company communicated .
In July , the VW brand sold 449100 cars , down 1.8 percent fewer than in the previous month .
In Western Europe alone , the second-largest market after China , sales were down 14 percent year-on-year .
In the home market of Germany , deliveries fell by almost one-sixth .
Brandvertriebschef Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July , mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
Moreover , in some core markets `` purchasing power '' had been retained by `` changed economic conditions '' .
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote also had an impact on the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokeswoman .
In the US , where the exhaust gas escalation first escalated , there is also a further minus .
Great support for VW is the Chinese market .
All in all , the mainly affected housemark of the Lower Saxony is still light-hearted by the diesel scandal : After the first seven months , only a delivery margin of 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles is booked .
Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales slump from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles were delivered by Volkswagen during this period , 5.904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test .
Alone in Germany , VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to be converted into the workshops .
In the course of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
After the conversion of the vehicles there was no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
According to the builder , the customer would issue a `` guarantee-equivalent '' certificate after the conversion , but he did not speak of a `` guarantee '' , as it was called in company days on Friday .
The reason was legal subtleties .
The `` Focus '' had reported that Volkswagen now gives its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models .
This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
It was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that this meeting existed .
`` VW has to fulfill the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA in full . ''
`` Deviations from this are not accepted , '' said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , according to the ministry .
VW has taken over the warranty that no deterioration takes place after the retrofitting in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power and that all vehicle approval values relevant to type approval remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term `` guarantee '' as it was called in company .
With the broad concept of `` guarantee '' , Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example six months after retrofitting , might come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could be attributed to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
In the interests of the customer , it is also important to avoid the possibility of any possible damage to the exhaustion dilemma resulting in uncertainty as to the possible guarantee arrangements .
Therefore VW does not use the term `` guarantee '' .

Salzburg `` West Side Story '' with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the `` West Side Story '' with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , much like Romeo and Juliet .
Including a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
A musical conquers Salzburg : the `` West Side Story '' , Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece .
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth space .
In the orchestra pit , the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel : `` This music is full of rhythm '' , he enthuses .
We always say that it is very Latin-American .
There are many Latin ingredients in their tempo and melody .
It is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein 's music in our blood !
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria .
She remembers with sadness her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
The role of Maria always fascinated me .
Firstly because it is musically extraordinary !
And then there was Mary 's personality .
She says it in her song : `` I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and witty and bright . ''
So she is wise , of course also naive , and very passionate .
`` It is very similar to my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , '' laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : `` Cecilia is a wonderful artist . ''
It is so an honor for us to work with her .
She is an immensely generous man .
And Bartoli returns the compliment : `` Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! ''
Conducting is a necessity for him .
You see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
We both have a more southern temperament , a fire , a passion and a joyous approach to life , which is very important at all !
For the American director Philip Wm . McKinley , the `` West Side Story '' is highly contemporary : `` This play is about prejudice and fanaticism . ''
Today we have the refugees , then the Puerto Ricans went to New York , and the New Yorkers did not want them .
They are the same themes , and they are just as relevant today as they were then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
For me , this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow , just as it was in London in 2012 , when we were doing a great deal to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End .
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow .
For our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs , and put an end to the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
As we were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage .
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow .
There are always obstacles to overcome , but Heathrow answers every question asked .
Like the Olympics , Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in corporate growth , and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK .
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented an £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in terms of time and budget from the T5 , which has been voted the world 's best airport terminal five years in a row , to the T2 that was built in the middle of the two busiest catwalks in the world .
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
It is time we steered this Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow , securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Better traffic flow on the highway
It regularly juts down the road - here is a picture of November .
But this is to change : the right turn lane is to be extended .
This is a good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the road every evening when they drive over the motorway junction ( A 43 ) .
On the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16/17 August ) the Landesbetrieb Straßenbau extends the right turn lane around 700 meters in the area between Hammerstraße and the Weseler Straße exit .
Drivers can then straight from the Hammerstraße turn right .
The big advantage is that traffic is split up at an early stage , which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Federal Highway 51 .
The idea with the extended exit was the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West .
The road narrowing on the feeder annoyed the drivers mainly between 17 and 19 clock .
On working days , the backwater reaches the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes even beyond .
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße .
From here the traffic is only one-lane over the motorway bridge .
The second lane had to be reconstructed well over three and a half years ago .
The reason : Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load-bearing capacity , in particular to accommodate heavy-load traffic in two lanes .
How long this bottleneck and the associated workplace jam will last , can not say the responsible state enterprise .
However , it is to be expected that the bridge will have an official rest period until 2034 .
For the extension of the right turn lane , the state enterprise deliberately selected the traffic-weaker time during the school holidays because disabilities were to be expected .
On Tuesday and Wednesday , the traffic will be lapped past the construction site .

Relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you waddle around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning is far from the alarm rattling not to think of sleep .
This is anything but relaxing .
After all , you are in good company with such problems : According to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not restful .
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves ?
There are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can be caused by a variety of causes , stresses Hans-Günter Weeß , Member of the Board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine .
What one understands commonly under it , however , is the insomnia , thus a Eingang and Durchlaufstörung .
The caring-mindedness feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagenknecht , board member in the German House of Physicians Association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel .
What is sleep disorders ?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex .
Behind this , organic , psychological or behavioral factors , as well as drugs , can be found .
Not infrequently , the sleep disorder expresses another disorder .
`` Very early waking is particularly common in depression , '' says Weeß .
And it may be that different factors condition each other .
For example , if you have an intervertebral disc , you may be ill , wake up every two or three hours , and perhaps start thinking about everyday problems and nursing , says Weeß .
This leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
When should you go to the doctor with sleep problems ?
Anyone who does not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired the day should go to the doctor , Weeß advises .
The impairment can be quite different : one is repulsive , tired , has no sleep , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irritable , has mood swings or physical discomforts such as stomach or headaches .
In order to relieve sleep disturbance , it is important to find out their causes .
Possible treatment options include behavioral changes , cognitive behavioral therapy or medication - classic sleep apneas only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks .
There is hardly any sleep-doctor in Germany , emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze , director of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin .
That is why we should go to the family doctor in the case of sleeping problems , Weeß advises .
The investigator can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should go to the Schlaflabor , and what happens ?
For examina- tion in the sleep lab , doctors advise , for example , in cases of snoring with respiratory exacerbations , in case of sickly fatigue , sleepwalkers , or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fietze explains .
You do not have to prepare yourself for the examination .
You should spend the day normally .
`` Just do not make a mid-day sleep , '' says Fietze .
After cabling , you go to bed at your normal time .
In addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose-glasses , a chest-belt and a feeler on the finger .
In addition , a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping .
How can people affected the problems ?
There are quite a lot of set screws , which can be used for a better sleep .
Weeß counts : regular sleeping and resting times , not lying too long in bed , not sleeping in the day , not watching TV to sleep , avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately , and that is not at all beneficial .

Despite doping : these athletes still have medal opportunities at the Olympics in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin had already been suspended twice because of doping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanova is not allowed to start in Rio .
Other athletic athletes can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio .
The issue of doping still determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics .
The Russian swimmer , Yulia Jefimova , who had sued her right of entry shortly before the games after a doping ban , was mercilessly knocked out and booed at her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
There was a bizarre scene : with a raised smile , she had strolled into the hall and had provoked with her appearance .
The audience broke into a jubilee when it was clear that they were not going to get gold .
But there are a lot of other athletes who are going to take part in the Olympics in Rio despite the doping past .
Here is an overview :
Justin Gatlin ( 100 , 200 , 4x100 m-relay / USA ) : The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics .
He has already been banned twice for doping ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
Since his spell , the Olympian winner of 2004 and ex-world champion even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt .

Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
With the abolition of the sanctions , according to Levan Dzhagaryan , the Russian ambassador to Iran , the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 per cent year-on-year .
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , the interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country grew strongly , the Ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
Of course , further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , `` said Dzhagaryan .
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million .
In particular , Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent , jumping to $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
The trade boom has been achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , `` said the Ambassador .
Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
Last year , the Russian foreign representative issued about 35,000 visas , primarily travel to Iran , to Iranian citizens .
In addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year , are broken , `` he said .
At the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
`` I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd , the monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in a good state , '' he said .

Cats react more sensitively as hangovers to cries of the beasts
In Hanover , biologists have investigated the effects of calling cats on adult animals .
To their surprise , the meowing did not leave the males cold - but they always behaved the same as the females .
Female cats can recognize the excitement of catbabies at the meow of the small .
They react ten per cent faster to sounds of kittens , who are in great need , as scientists from the Veterinary College and the Medical University of Hannover ( MHH ) have found out .
Kater also respond to the calls of kittens - however , always the same .
`` Apparently the acoustic differences between the meandering of less and strongly excited young animals are either not perceptible or not important for the males , '' said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH .
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the specialist magazine `` BMC Evolutionary Biology '' .
In a previous study the researcher had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries differed with the urgency of their need for help .
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed .
On the one hand , they were called by small children , who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings .
On the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens , which were additionally raised .
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the low sample .
`` All females , even those who did not have their own offspring , responded differently to the screams , '' said Konerding .
They turned to the loudspeaker more quickly when the calls of the more excited kitties took place .
This ability is possibly congenital or develops with the sexual maturity .
`` One surprise was that the males have responded at all , '' said the biologist .
In the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds in humans .
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , reports the biologist Marina Scheumann .

Future of the smelting of Portland due to the abolition of the energy contract questionable
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria , as well as hundreds of workplaces , are at stake , as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company reported .
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the plant to be awarded .
A subsidy for 20 years expires in November .
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake .
No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered in the event of a closure .
In addition , Dominoeffects could occur because the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria 's total electricity production .
In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter , which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alcoa 's smelter in Portland loses money and risks closing it down .
This step follows the many years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and , most recently , the electricity price for the plant .
AGL , which supplies the large aluminum smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley , announced that it expects three other owners to terminate their contracts .
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina , of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares .
`` AGL expects that the plant in Portland will continue to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the smelter , '' the company said .
AGL also said that the contracts were so-called `` hedging transactions '' , which should have come into effect from November 2016 onwards .
The contracts have a 12-month notice period , so they will end in 2017 .
`` Therefore , AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17 , '' said the electricity supplier .
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL as of FY 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the major markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL stated that it had written off the value of the contracts already in its annual financial statements of $ 187 million in `` expectation of a termination '' .
Alcoa said that the decision to deregister the contracts , `` the ability of Alcoas ... to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter . ''
The US company said it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which should have come into effect from November this year , even though it still owes an explanation of why it has resigned from the contract .
Analysts are warning that the Portland smelter will be shut down in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions in the industry .
Referring to analysts ' statements earlier this week , Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and that Tomago consumes about 900 megawatts of electricity .
If both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [ electricity market ] .
And it would not be good for us as an electricity producer , `` he said .

Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral frauds flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a crushing government report today .
The former Cabinetmember Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police , election observers , and town halls to ignore evidence of abuse of choice due to `` hypocrisy about religion and ethnicity '' .
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government , now an anti-corruption kings , said the intimidation of religious voters was so bad that the police should be allowed to set barrier bands outside election booths to protect intimidated voters .
He recommends that voters should carry an identity card to prove their identity in elections .
At the moment , a voter simply needs to name his name and address .
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person 's finger when they cast their voices to prevent someone from dialing twice .
Whistleblowers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
He calls for the press to have more access to community records and decisions by unofficial committees or working groups .
`` This is not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , '' he said .
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet 's election scandal in East London .
Last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor , Lutfur Rahman , should be exempted from corrupt and illegal practices after a litany .
The court found that Rahman `` perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community '' cynically , `` and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia .
Rahman is said to have `` led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . ''
Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country .
In particular , he expressed an alarming response to the fraudulent correspondence - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including passing IDs to prove identity
In his report , the report stated that `` pressure was being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background .
`` There were concerns that ... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior because of '' politically correct `` hypocrises about ethnicity and religion . ''
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition of political activists to edit the voting documents to stop `` electoral '' .
The report , which is being considered by Theresa May , also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the election list from being used for immigration and social welfare purposes .
Consider options to ask voters before the election for your ID .
Use non-removable ink on a person 's finger as soon as she has cast her voice to prevent someone from dialing twice .
Systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to vote .
A three-year limit on applications for automatic dialing .
Prohibition of political activists working on full postal and envelopes .
Give the police the power to set up barriers around polling stations .
A law amendment which facilitates an accusation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 ( Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983 ) .
Photography prohibition in election stations .
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go into the election booth alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it `` amazing '' that after the Tower Hamlet 's case no criminal complaint was made .
`` The electoral court declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unfit for corruption and illicit practices because of a litany , '' he said .
He was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons , according to the high requirements of the criminal procedure .
He also criticized the ineffective `` check controls '' of the electoral registration departments of the town halls .
Sir Eric said , `` The judging in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal .
Our country , as the mother of parliaments , has a proud heritage , but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities threaten this reputation .

`` One generation protested '' in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
Witnesses say that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunpoint .
Is Ethiopia just breaking up ?
Over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy .
But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas .
Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
The government 's response , according to human rights organizations , was ruthless .
Witnesses stated that policemen were shooting and killing at tens of unarmed demonstrators .
Videos circulating about the protests , presumably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall .
The head of the United Nations Human Rights Authority is now asking for an in-depth investigation .
`` It has always been difficult to keep this country together , and in the future it will be even more difficult , '' said Rashid Abdi , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is , after Nigeria , the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . Only a few countries in Africa , if any , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia 's economy expanded at a considerable pace .
Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa .
The streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organizations have consistently repressed the government , the opposition in the country has been restricted , and dissidents have been effectively silenced .
Many were sent to exile or to prison , killed or driven into the vastness of the desert .
But that could change .
`` If you oppress people and they have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , '' said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia .
All the youth protested .
One generation protested .
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to strangleholds with regard to the power of the ruling coalition .
After a widely criticized election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
At the same time , the tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising , a struggle for this jagged , controversial line required hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden , which have been more or less conquered in recent years , could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again .
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are exploding after years of aching below the surface now .
The first seems harmless : smartphones .
Only in recent years have very many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media , as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the Internet services improved .
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide where they are .
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered in protest .
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
For ages , the Amharas , coming from Ethiopia 's predominantly Christian highlands , prospered in politics and economics , exploiting the Oromos , many of whom are Muslims and live in flatland areas .
But that too is changing .
`` We are going to coordinate under one umbrella , '' said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of the Oromos .
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , commerce and politics .
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was prime minister until his death in a non-publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years .
He was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners .
Analysts say he was particularly savvy in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special commissioners to deal with opponents and render them harmless .
`` The current regime lacks this basic skill , '' said Mr. Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Ethiopia 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take over the position of Mr. Meles .
Unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services .
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed .
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005 , when thousands protested against elections that , according to analysts , seemed to be bogged down by the government and subsequently stolen .
During the subsequent raids , many protesters were killed , even though it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly .
Development experts praised Ethiopia 's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty .
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal dislike of the Ethiopian government .
And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
Last month , protesters in Gondar , an Amharic city , started business from Tigray , and the hatred of the Tigray became more common in the social media .
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
The US government used Ethiopia as the basis for drones over neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base .
While the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
`` This , '' said Mr. Abdi , `` is a very thin tightrope walk . ''

Olympia : Dreist fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya 's light athletes face unfavor after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
After a fraud attempt in a doping control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
The International Olympic Committee announced its intention to establish a disciplinary commission as soon as possible to investigate the case .
A Kenyan official had indicated that the former sprinter and today 's coach , John Anzrah , had given a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runners Ferguson Rotich .
This had been reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers .
The IAAF World Federation has asked the IOC for information on the case to investigate its own , an IAAF spokesman said .
`` Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC , the IAAF will carry out an assessment , '' said an IAAF statement .
`` He ( Anzrah ) has gone to the doping control station and has given himself as Ferguson Rotich , gave the test and signed it , '' declared Kenya 's chief deputy Stephan Arap Soi .
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency .
In 2015 , Ferguson Rotich had become world champion fourth in 800 meters .
Four days before , the Kenyan athletics delegation chief , Michael Rotich , had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
He is supposed to have informed the athletes of his country about doping tests .
According to media reports , he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special scrutiny at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offenses .
In announcing the more than 2,000 doping control controls launched by the IOC before the Rio Games , it was unusual to note that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil .
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympic Games .
As a result , WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the WADA rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
In a series of television reports of the ARD , accusations have repeatedly been raised that in Kenya doping means are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of the sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics .
It could be shown that this type of sport was doped and systematically doped .
Russia 's athletes were then excluded from the summer games .

A controversial baseball star is leaving
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in base days from base to base .
After his emotional resignation announcement , the 41-year-old pro will be wearing the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays .
`` I love this game and this team . ''
`` I say 'Goodbye ' to both , '' said the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Three times , Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
His signing under a ten-year contract has earned him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
Until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as advisor and youth coaching agent at full salary .
As a player , it paid Rodriguez a long time with performance .
He made some milestones with 696 homers , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( `` Runs '' ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees .
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important stats .
But the 41-year-old should not be accepted into the hall of fame of the baseball .
Because Rodriguez , nicknamed `` A-Rod '' , was so successful in the field , his controversy is out of place .
Already in 2009 , the superstar at `` ESPN '' gave up to have forbidden steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
In August 2013 he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a complication in the biogenesis scandal .
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received an anti-aging clinic in South Florida .
After a legal dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
`` The league could have done me a favor for the year 2014 , because I 've been playing for 20 years without a break , '' said Rodriguez at the time , smugly .
Even his farewell days do not run silently .
While many baseball legends once again get the big stage in their last games , Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench .
`` My job does not include a farewell tour . ''
`` My job involves trying to win every game , '' said Yankees coach Joe Girardi .
After all , Rodriguez , who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and is credited with the pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson , received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee arch rival Boston Red Sox .
`` We want A-Rod , '' the supporters sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

The right `` identity movement '' has become the target of the Federal Office for Protection of the Constitution .
After several state offices , the constitutional protectionists in the Confederation also placed the group under observation .
`` We see the '' identity movement `` as a sign of efforts to achieve the democratic freedom of the democratic order , '' said Hans-Georg Maaßen , constitutional protection chief of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
Thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed extremistically .
That is why we are now watching the movement .
The `` Identity Movement '' is a grouping of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
It turns against `` multicultural madness '' , `` uncontrolled mass migration '' and the `` loss of one 's own identity by means of alienation '' .
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hesse , Berlin , Baden-Wuerttemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the `` identity '' .
Maaßen said that his authority had worked closely with the Landesamtes on the decision .
`` Groups like the 'Identity Movement ' are trying to get their target group where they are , '' said the Constitutional Commissioner .
In general , extremists try to address them with a youthful language , often with poppy music .
The Islamists as well as the right-wing extremists .
This is not a commercial advertisement for your own cause .
The propaganda should appeal to the people emotionally .
Young people are particularly vulnerable .
This is dangerous .
Recently , several federal states reported on contacts of the `` identities '' with AfD politicians .
Maaßen said that he had no knowledge about this .
For the protection of the constitution , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point onwards .
It is a question of whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - is changing its direction of direction by certain persons who are extremist , and becomes so extremist .
It is therefore decisive whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
This is not apparent .
With a view to the significant increase in the number of right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters , Maaßen said that he would not be talking about terrorism again .
But in the last few years we have noticed that there can be a right-wing terrorist structure .
There was the group 'Old School Society ' or the Freital group .
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groupings or microgroups are formed that plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugees ' homes or attacks from other right-wing extremists .
A German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is however not recognizable .
The existing groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Worried , Maaßen was concerned that many of the attacks were on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
This is the cause of concern .
Many of the suspects were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated offenders , or supporters of the right-wing scene .
`` So many people have committed crimes that were previously unchecked by right-wing extremists , who were perhaps politically indifferent or who , for example , chose the CDU , the SPD , or the left , which then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist sentiment . ''

Community , spirit , health : Singing is good for seniors
Ursel Kipp has been involved in singing her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she studied music in her lehramt studies , and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir .
`` Singing moves me - emotionally and physically , '' she says .
After a rehearsal , she feels balanced , cheerful and altogether livelier , she says .
By the way , she does something good for her health and her spirit .
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives , says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior Citizens League .
Most seniors sing in chorus and share the joy of the music with like-minded people , describes Hackler .
Through the regular gathering , seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts .
Because social and family structures often disappear in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
This experience has also been made by Ursel Kipp in her choir : `` To be able to talk and to organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cooperation '' .
Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense , says Hackler .
For this , seniors train a deep and controlled breathing .
If you regularly ask for your lungs , you do not get so fast out of your daily routine .
Even when it comes to keeping the tone of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
Singen has often had a very special effect on the elderly , says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen .
In the older generations the singing together had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in the elderly arouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
Through song texts and particularly melodies , even dementia patients recall long-standing events .
When singing , the head is also called for a special performance , explains Lenz .
At the same time , concentrating on one 's own voice and on a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers is a great cognitive challenge .
Older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
Another positive aspect is the recognition one gets through the singing in a choir , says Hackler .
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
Self-esteem also grows through singing in a choir .
To show oneself : When I practice for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
Good reasons to start singing , there is enough .
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , advises Lenz .
One does not sing alone - in 50 singing people , who is listening to it when a sound goes wrong ?
In the search for the right offer , seniors have different possibilities , says Hackler .
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a seniors ' choir , one can simply join .
Many cities also offer surveys on the choirs in the area .
If you want to sing in a church choir , you can go directly to the church or the church head .
Many seniors choirs can also be found on the Internet .
If you do not have access to the Internet , you can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with internet searches .
If you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , Hackler advises .
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for all ages .

Violent rains , flooding give rise to rescue operations in Louisiana , Mississippi
Violent rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday , with more rainfall all Saturday .
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rainfall , the National Weather Service reported .
John Bel Edwards , Governor of Louisiana , said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already underway .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the Governor 's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , said the number of inquiries for floods , boats , and sundresses increased .
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags .
A flood warning system is being deployed across much of southern Louisiana until Saturday .
The weather service announced that there might be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
In the south of Alabama , an early flood warning system was deployed on Friday while it continued to rain in Mobile .
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs , both located in Louisiana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge .
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger because they will flow slowly over the river into Lake Maurepas .
The River Tickfaw , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest score ever recorded on Friday at 09.00 .
Rescue teams still plucked people from the flood waters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife , and his step-son were among those who were rescued on Friday near Gloster .
Hansford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet from his house , rose sharply overnight .
He said that another stepdaughter who lived nearby had warned him .
`` We have woken up and the water poured and poured in , '' said Hansford .
It reached my waist .
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a high rise in the river .
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and that he was the only one who could swim .
Hansford said emergency aid had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster , where they were lodged until Friday .
Krautmann said the flooding had spread `` quickly '' , as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions .
According to Krautmann , an observer near Livingstone reported a rain of 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday morning .
Krautmann said that the ground had been drastically affected by the rainfall since Wednesday .
The authorities said heavy rainfall and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their houses in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts .
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa ruled over 200 flooded houses .
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches , which were now both flooded .
The head of the community , Robby Miller , said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals flushed by the flood .
In the cities of Amite and Hammond emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the evacuees .
`` As soon as the water begins to return , they will be able to return to their homes , '' he said .
In the town of Hammond , Tangipahoa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood , and sandbags were provided for the residents , who were hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
`` The last major flooding we had was in March , '' said Lacy Landrum from the city administration .
This seems to be a similar incident .
In Mississipp , the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it was raining on the Gulf Coast .
According to his data , a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday , but no reports have been reported on Friday .
Keith Townson , manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
`` I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , '' said Townson , `` and it still comes . ''

More than just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running at Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced Thursday the news on her Instagram account .
`` In a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , '' wrote Kendall .
The reunion of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians ? ) , Scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family ( with the exception of the Rob and Caitlyn problems and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest ) .
This is the stereotype of almost every birthday episode of a children 's song ( Seacrest brought the sentence `` You thought we 'd forgotten you , '' with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcasting slot at 8am ) , but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity .
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue has certainly begun a new era of Kardashians .
Kendall 's big sister , Kim , likes to hit on the Vogue cover ( she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league of its own .
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue .
With a volume that is more like an image book than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( Laut Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising from the 832 pages of the Wälzers ) .
The revelation of his coverstar is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine had leaked before the official announcement .
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In recent years , there were clearly more `` celebrities who model '' than `` models that are celebrities '' on the cover .
Oscar-winner and Dior-Markenbotschafterin Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady Gaga had the honor .
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the `` breakthrough model '' of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
These celebrities are not related to famous characters or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good snapchat video ( even if it all applies to Jenner ) .
They are truly talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade .
Of course , Jenner 's success does not appeal to everyone .
With her reality TV story , Jenner 's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense .
In June , the former Victoria 's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her `` the bitches of the moment . ''
These feelings boiled again as the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover .
But to ride around on the disgust seems to have passed at the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue .
It is literally a supermodel .
She is running for Marc Jacobs .
It makes advertising for your foundation by Estee Lauder .
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps .
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford 's daughter to LOVE magazine .
And in her spare time , she is on Reality TV , probably to see her sister Kourtney and her children .

Police use teargas & gummigges against protesting Brazilian students
Students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police on Thursday , when they gathered to demonstrate against the government 's reforms for the public education system .
The police used tear gas and gummy shots against the demonstrators .
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart , causing the police to use gummy guns and tear gas .
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their consternation about the plans .
According to the proposals of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , slightly less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money .
Some of the protestants saw Graffitits spray against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls .
The latest protests took place a few days after demonstrators were massively on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff , who had been removed from office by a Senate vote .

The charges per cubic meter of wastewater will be 3,36 Euro ( previously 2,26 Euro ) for Zulndberg / Lindenberg / Lopp and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro ( previously 2,18 Euro ) for the sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro .
At the plant in Azendorf the waste water charge will increase again at the latest , if appropriate improvements are necessary .
According to a rough calculation , the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter .
As mayor Bernd Steinhauser ( CSU ) reported , during the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach , it was found that these wastewater systems were subject to underfloating .
According to legal grounds , the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants on a cost-effective basis .
From October 1 , 2016 the citizens , as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the money bag .
The charges are between 48 and 67 percent .
As the manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee , a re-calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary .
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overlays and undercoverings from the previous calculation period should also be offset .
The grave fee increases justified Schmidt that all three sewage plants are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater incidence ranging from 6800 to 12000 cubic meters per year .
For example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact , due to the small distribution base .
In addition , the wastewater volume in all three plants declined slightly .
Furthermore , in the course of the last calculation period , renovation and repair expenditures had to a considerable extent been incurred for all three plants , not least because of their age .
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Welschkahl , Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf sewage plant because of a damage .
The nearly 20-year-old conveyor system had to be completely overhauled in the pumping plant Welschkahl . After nearly 20 years of operation , the first clarification plant had to be excavated , the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to comply with the water legislation .
Schmidt : `` These extraordinary expenses were attributable to the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period . ''
The same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly below the present level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 .
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low level of waste water in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance `` fully durchschlag '' .
At the same time , added Schmidt , the market community had spared major maintenance costs in sewage plants in the past 20 years .
According to Steinhäuser , the situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long term , especially since the supply areas of the Friesenbachtal sewage disposal network can not be extended by these facilities because they are deficient facilities .

Rescue in the Moelfre Bay : Three men have `` happiness still to be alive ''
Three men are `` lucky to be still alive '' after being thrown out of their fishing boat off Anglesey .
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Station bounced on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay .
The three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved on on their own .
`` We saw the boat turn around in their vicinity , and they presented the worst , '' said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones .
`` Fortunately , the strong winds have blown the boat out of their reach , until we let ourselves into water , '' he added .
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat , while the third man , at the age of 60 , was exhausted and found hanging from a buoy without a rescue vest .
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said , `` The three men who were thrown into the water , happiness are uninjured and still alive .
The boatmotor had an emergency stop line , but this broke when the boat was capsized by the person who steered the boat .
Someone has watched over these men today .

Why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
This is what I am imagining in the gymnastics of women 's gymnastics , and for more than one reason .
Firstly , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
And secondly , this team has three gymnasts , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren `` Laurie '' Hernandez , who were inspiring for many young girls of different skin color .
The structure of this team , which is Aly Raisman , the Jewish woman , and Madison Kocian , the Catholic , makes everyone proud .
This team finally reflects the United States .
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
In the last four years , the number one female gymnast was an African-American .
Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 .
This shows strength .
At the last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered .
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez , as they delivered unexpected but masterly Gymastikroutinen .
On Thursday , Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American woman to win gold at an individual multi-match event for women .
Team member Aly Raisman won silver .
We are experiencing the top of this sport , but it does not look like a gymnasium in the whole country .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team .
They are the `` last five '' because the next Olympics will have only four gymnasts in the team , as well as last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach .
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and Turner is primarily used in private gymnasiums maintained by parents who are responsible for the training , equipment , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymnasts and families ) .
The majority of these gymnasiums are located in affluent suburbs , which can support the business .
In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families .
Aimee Boorman , coach of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , coach of Laurie Hernandez , have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics .
We must allow a more affordable and accessible gymnastics to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie .
I founded my own founding of 20 years .
At my events , we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters ( especially black and Hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
In September , we will be expanding to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Gymnastics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
This combination provides life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
It is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls get interested in gymnastics and that is great .
It is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
This is such an exciting time .
Thanks to Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby , and Madison for this real representation of `` Girl Power '' by bringing the Olympic team-mate and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds motivate her to start her way to becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .

How to protect yourself with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you .
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi , a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range .
Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber .
If you approach them from behind , you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and `` get out of the shot , '' says Mizrachi .
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow in the face .
Then strike him with the knee in the groin and twist the weapon out of his hands as the attacker collapses in pain . Hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while they are pointing the gun at him .
For attackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot .
At the same time , relocate the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest , then twist the gun out of its handle before moving backward and directing the gun toward him .
Sounds difficult ?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing it .
But remember that if you are not a Krav Maga Grandmaster , it is safest to hand over your money to a robbery .

Pokémon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been mourned by many in the last decade .
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
The time on the screen was initially limited to television , then to video games , and most recently to smartphones .
Therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I 'm referring to the Pokémon Go Madness , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a series of characters , playing cards and other spin-offs ) .
Like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest decreased before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
Market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand , which overloaded the servers .
Within a few days , Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
How does it work ?
In short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon tracked with a GPS and once captured they can be `` photographed '' ( captured on a mobile phone screen ) or `` captured '' .
A generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the delusion and jumped for the search from the sofa .
In the US , the game led to a considerable increase in the number of steps the `` average '' person spent every day .
Cardiogram , an app for AppleWatch that tracks 35,000 users , recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game , the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes every day is 45 percent to 53 percent .
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to increase performance .
Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to `` take 30 minutes to get off the couch '' and `` be active every day '' have fallen on deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable .
Nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be overstated .
People who exercise regularly exercise their chances of getting cancer or depression .
Physical exercise helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
But the great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy .
Thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
Some people even make new friends on the hunt .
As always , there are sullen game shooters , who always have to complain about something .
And yes , someone could run against a door .
What is it ?
A breakthrough has occurred .
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does .
The new will lose its charm and the use will subside over time .
However , due to Pokemon 's success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world action , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Who builds Braunschweig 's cheap apartments ?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be much more involved in the future .
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
The SPD is proposing a `` Housing Action Plan '' at the next Council meeting .
But dispute is programmed .
First and foremost , the question is : Who is to build the cheap apartments ?
A regulation is missing so far .
SPD parliamentary group leader Christoph Bratmann said : `` We agree with the Greens . If you want to build on urban areas , you will have to show 20 % of all apartments as social apartments . ''
The cheap apartments can however also arise in the stock .
However , Bratmann says , `` How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? ''
`` We want investors to build at least 10 per cent , but as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social apartments on such areas . ''
A new urban housing development program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is intended to provide incentives .
The problem , according to Bratmann : `` There is currently no agreement between the political groups . ''
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
The left still wants tough conditions for investors .
Irrespective of this , Bratmann said that the situation on the housing market was exacerbating .
If the action plan is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
More staff is required .
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
But the program is not yet complete : the 1260 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
How , however , is the loss of a further 1,300 low-priced apartments , which will be phased out in the coming years ?
Alone by the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
In order to prevent this , according to the planning-political spokeswoman Nicole Palm , now expiring bonds should be purchased from the city .
In addition , it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into price .
This is possible in Weststadt .
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop .
In the Weststadt deadlines expire at the end of the year .
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price-fixing for cheap apartments .
The owners , the housing associations , do not want that .
For the number of social apartments in the Weststadt is once again drastically increased , one moves away from the goal of so-called intermixing .
There should be no concentration of social weakness in only a few districts .
The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
Holger Herlitschke , President of the Swiss parliament , said : `` The CDU must be involved in the boat for a broad majority . ''
It had concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses .
But what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .

Jennifer Aniston : I am always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
The Hollywood star has now made it clear in an interview .
`` I 'm always stuck in drawers or get labels from outside , which have little to do with me and the reality . ''
`` I do not want to be perfect and successful . ''
`` Honestly , these things are more of a snap to me . ''
Jennifer Aniston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered a `` Miss Perfect '' , as she explains in the current `` Cosmopolitan '' .
The actress likes to spend her time at home , in front of television with a loose dump and Mexican food , says the magazine .
To the incandescence , she asked the question : `` We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , '' the Hollywood star said .
In her new film `` Mother 's Day '' , Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
The film will take place from August 25th .

The military administration distorts ISIS secret service information , establishes the Congress committee
United States Central Command militants changed news intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria than would have permitted the actual conditions on the ground , a Congressional Review Committee reported in a Thursday report .
The preliminary report , prepared by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee , the Secret Service Commission , and the Wehrbud Commander , reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state .
The Central Command , or Cencom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
`` News-related information typically typed by high-ranking Centcom commanders typically drew a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground , and were more positive than the analysis of other news services , '' a newspaper article quoted .
`` What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyzes are presented to our political leaders , '' noted Ken Calvert , Republican member of the House of Representatives .
The management errors in Centcom reach to the highest point of the organization .
The ten-page report shows in detail consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyzes of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic state 's threat , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
`` During the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts , '' the report noted .
For example , a Centcom official publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mosul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic state .
`` After months of investigation , so much is clear , '' said Mike Pompeo , Republican Congressman from Kansas , in an opinion .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq .
The Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic state .
The report , published on Thursday , will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigation will continue .
In addition , further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Engineer of the Ministry of Defense .
Democratic members of the intelligence community published their own findings on Thursday , which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force .
`` In 2014 and 2015 , Centcom created an overly limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services , '' the top-ranking Democrat in the committee , member of the House of Representatives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in an opinion .
This process , Mr. Schiff said , `` delayed the publication of news reports , '' harmed the morale among analysts , and `` gave too little space for dissent . ''
But Mr Schiff and the Democrats said they had not found any evidence of White House intervention by the Centcom analysts regarding a `` particular political opinion '' .
The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by `` The Daily Beast '' .
Last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon 's General Investigator , who were received after complaints from Centcom analysts .
Patrick Evans , a press officer of the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports from the Congress while the investigator 's investigations were still in progress .
But he also stated that `` experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . ''
The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
However , last year 's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises .
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state is reminiscent of more than ten years ago , when a centcom analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts to a small occupation group in Iraq and little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic state .
Last year , according to government officials , the team around Mr. Hooker notes that , contrary to the government 's statements , the air raids against the Islamic state 's refineries had no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group because these provisional refineries were commissioned to sell oil on the black market .
This finding , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Centcom 's former commander , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticized by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .

Snapchat `` anime '' effect criticized as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired , but some observers say it is insensitive to races .
With its filter tool , Snapchat allows around 150 million users daily to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd .
You can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
The filters are blunt , proprietary twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfs per day .
All the missing parts are released to the public .
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past by accusing the app of promoting Blackface or propagating white skin as a beauty ideals .
When this week a few users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes , false teeth and puffy cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - `` yellow face '' .
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Verge and Motherboard , one day after Snapchat communicated that it would have disabled the feature .
The company offered an apology : the filter was intended to be an homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians .
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of injurious stereotypes .
Others rejected the anime comparison .
In an email , Grace Sparapani , a Korean-American art student , whose tweet about the photos were widely spread , wrote that the filter was `` hurtful and uncomfortable . ''
She added that `` it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
It shows that the filter is not yellowish , but the yellow face has been pulled into the depreciating extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural tripping wires .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in our hands .
And Snapchat 's large audience of young people , who are more diverse than their older counterparts , might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
When one of Snapchat 's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , `` it 's much harder that such things go unnoticed than they used to be , '' said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday .
On Thursday , Zhu , a product manager and engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account , asking others to do the same .
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the largely white , only male leadership , and ended her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
`` Either they do not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , '' said the Chinese-American Zhu , `` or they have people with different skin colors working there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what . ''
Others share their opinions , a complaint that left Snapchat largely unanswered .
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
On Thursday , Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Zhu said that she will close her Snapchat account and added , `` I wonder if they need more users like us to say that is not O.K . ''

Illness : When the organizer pays
After traveling , sick travelers will only get money back when the cause of the illness is found in the hotel .
This is only the case , however , if more than ten per cent of the guests show the same symptoms .
In the negotiated case , on the second day of their holiday in Turkey , a family was seriously ill with diarrhea and vomiting .
They spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a faulty sewage treatment plant , which supposedly polluted the seawater .
The family was of the opinion that the trip was thus deficient - and complained against the organizer .
The applicants had no success in court .
Although the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
However , the organizer learned only shortly before the departure of the plaintiffs .
He had until then to assume that the seawater was in order .
He did not therefore violate his information requirements , according to the verdict .
Especially since in the samples of the water no impurities were found .
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among themselves - belong to the general risk of life .
Of 691 guests , only 38 were ill .

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have been inspired by the trainer 's cancer to ride the helm
There will be no more emotinal gold than with these games and that will mean something .
From the first helm to the last , 220 hard hieve that go down in history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa .
Even if they were only the two who were at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . Robin Williams ' echo was all-rounder as they rowed to the second Olympic gold medal in the second without the helm , the first women in the history of British sport .
Their dominance was absolute , after all their unbeaten run , which is also unprecedented .
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph to the full .
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago if he would ever survive the day when cancer was diagnosed .
As he said , he was risky .
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did .
If you do not , it spreads everywhere .
It would have been a pretty bad situation .
It changes the view somewhat .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The trio was lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014 , off-season , which would keep the interruption to a minimum , if that is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
It was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would suffice .
This is how it begins .
Rowing itself is a challenge , but it makes it even bigger .
In the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve-racking morning talking more than usual , trying to deal with his own fears .
Stanning , who was the main man at the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan , said , `` I was an emotional wreck this week , which is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . ''
It only repeats how much it means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked .
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . He is the best coach in the world .
I could not have asked for a better person to train or a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years .
The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
Even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to unlock , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
We were very caught right now .
Helen cried `` stay in the process , stay in the process '' .
It is really important not to get carried away .
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something great .
We did not want a fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glover must appear next week at a wedding , her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall .
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that was my last race .
That would have meant too much pressure .
In London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympian winner .
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
It took about four minutes .
It feels so much better , `` she said .

Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax return for the year 2015 , which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal rate of 34.2 % .
In the year 2015 , the Clinton donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation , while former President Bill Clinton made nearly $ 5.3 million in Redehonoraren , and the former Secretary of State paid US $ 3 million to Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton 's candidate for the vice-presidency , Sen. Tim Kaine from Virginia , and his wife , Anne Holton , published his tax returns for the past ten years .
They paid an effective federal rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
`` Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , '' Clinton 's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement .
In a stark contrast , Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not required by law to do so .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his attorneys have given a reason for refusing a tax audit by the tax authorities .
`` You are on the train , '' wrote Clinton 's campaign leader Ian Sams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate .
On Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trumps Special Advisor , told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits are not finalized .
Trumps critics , including the Republican Presidential Candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney , have already stated that his refusal raises questions about wealth , his donations to charitable organizations , his business activities , and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already pounced on the issue , and on Friday published a video on the Internet , in which high-ranking Republicans Trump request to publish their tax return .
On Thursday she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
`` He refuses to do what every other Presidential candidate has done over the past few decades and publish his tax returns , '' she told the crowd .
Politico has reported that during the 1990s Trump did not pay very much or very little tax for two years , and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax attorneys and tax advisors on Friday stating that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett , who would ensure that individuals earning more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supported the proposal .
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska , Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here , asked Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the IRS , and Trump was `` afraid '' of the electorate , not the tax authorities .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax return due to the year 2007 .
The Clintons , now living in Chappaqua , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
The Clinton tax return of 2015 showed that they only paid $ 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
Its principal investment was a low-cost index fund from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of USD 109,000 .

Steel - light sight for German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of euros .
Financial strains , which threatened the industry from the promotion of green electricity , are off the table .
In the case of the exemption from the Renewable Energies apportionment in the existing facilities , the Federal Minister of the Economy , Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the `` Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung '' ( WAZ , Friday edition ) said that the German steel industry was to be freed from the Renewable Energies .
`` I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . ''
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers , who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
According to the German industry association , the steel industry was facing additional costs of € 120 to 240 million per year .
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
Only when the generators in the steelworks were replaced did an EEG apportionment of 20 per cent occur .
But this too is not collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission on the generation of own power .
Thus , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed .
Gabriel 's successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance .
`` With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future ' , this is a first step . ''
`` Others must follow . ''
`` Climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emissions trading , '' IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann explained in Frankfurt .
Since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel sector in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure .
Last year , the situation intensified further as the world 's largest producer country stepped up steel on the world market in the face of the weaker domestic demand .
European manufacturers are imposing price dumping on Chinese steel groups .
In the course of this spring the situation has relaxed somewhat .
On the one hand , import duties imposed on imported steel have acted , and on the other hand economic prospects have brightened in China .
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
The German industry prime Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday .
In the end , prices had stagnated again .
The industry is reacting to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
In the German steel industry , around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
In July , German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
At 3.4 million tons , they produced well six percent less crude steel than in the previous month , as the steel industry association announced on Friday .
After a short increase in May the quantity produced now went back one after the other for the second month .
Since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the previous year 's figure .
The Association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .

Donald Trump admits `` huge problems '' in the election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative federal states , to lose their majority .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now gave weaknesses to his election campaign in the Republican High Court of Utah .
A rare moment in which the multitillionaire , who is usually cocky and self-assured , expressed some kind of concern , as correspondents reported .
After throwing out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing .
`` We have tremendous problems in Utah , '' said Trump before evangelical Christians , asking for support in important states like Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
According to him , false reports of his candidacy were due , he resumed his well-known media scolding .
Republican fortresses wiggle
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans .
According to a survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June , Trump and his competitor were equated by the Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
Other institutions see Trump ahead , but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk .
In an interview with CNBC , Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton 's advance : `` Just as I 've done so far . ''
And postponed afterwards : this will either be `` successful '' or I will make a very very nice , long vacation `` .
He did nothing else than `` tell the truth '' .
If , in the end , he did not succeed for political reasons , Trump continued .
Then I return to a very good way of life .
According to press reports , the party Trump has threatened to cancel funds in support of his election campaign should he can not present better survey results .
Instead , the Republicans ' candidates for the congress would be more involved .

Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court .
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland 's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March .
The majority leader in Senate Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will nominate the successor of the late Judge to the Supreme Court , Antonin Scalia .
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to select Garland `` with a certain degree of certainty '' .
A spokeswoman from Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated .
He praised Garland and said Clinton 's team would not worry about a new candidate .
Garland is the highest judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia .
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination , were lackeys and helpers of Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump .
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency .

The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands a lot of savings from future savers - as the second institute in Germany .
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : `` It is only about 139 customers , who park 40 million euros on giro or day money accounts '' .
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single case and does not see any signal : Normal savers would `` not have to pay penal rates for their savings '' .
When banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
From September , Raiffeisenbank Gmund will demand this fee from private and corporate clients for deposits of more than EUR 100,000 on giro or daily money accounts .
`` The first 100,000 euros are free . ''
`` The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year , '' said Paul .
He has been guarding for some time 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not recycle .
`` They lie with me in the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , '' said the bank chief .
`` I can not lay down 4000 euros for every million . ''
The costs are now passed on according to the polluter pays principle .
To leave the cash simply in the Raiffeisenbank vaults would be much too dangerous : `` I 've already experienced four raids , I do not want to be the fifth ! '' Said the head of the bank .
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment .
Only a few migrated to other banks .
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria stated : `` The extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks '' .
To bear them alone is `` permanently unworkable '' .
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for bank accounts , credit cards or bank transfers .
The Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land , with its Skatbank branch in 2014 , had made headlines with interest on penalties for deposits of more than three million euros .
Michael Kemmer , chief executive officer of the banking association , said : `` We do not expect private customers to pay flat-rate charges for deposits , but the competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks . ''
A banker said there is `` a clientele that is more lushly endowed with assets '' at Tegernsee .
`` This can become a problem for a small bank '' , if they are free of money .
Founded in 1911 , the Genossenschaftsbank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach-Egern , Kreuth and Tegernsee .
In the region famous actors , sportsmen and entrepreneurs live .
The cooperative association of Bavaria `` currently no other banks are known , which charge a reimbursement of expenses for deposits of private customers , '' said spokesman Ernst .
The President of the Federal Association of German People 's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks ( BVR ) , Uwe Fröhlich , declared at the end of June : `` The threshold to go negatively towards the private customer is very , very high . ''
The competition is tough , and it threatens the migration of investors to the competition .
The customers in Germany will not be pleased with the width .

NASA Klimamodell : Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once habitable .
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have once exposed earth-like conditions .
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin Earth-like atmosphere , but still slowly turned .
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus .
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to shelter lives and protect from rapid evaporation .
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dull .
`` In the GISS model simulation , Venus 's slow rotation exposes her daytime of the sun for almost two months , '' explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release .
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a lot of the sun 's heat .
The result is average temperatures that are several degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
The model produced a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists .
Although it was once probably inhabitable , Venus was subjected to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for billions of years .
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt by the ultraviolet light .
When their hydrogen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained - the Venus , as we know it today .
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters .

Post is entering the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is evidently great .
The Post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter also .
The Group intends to start trading with the transporter shortly .
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters from the coming year also on the free car market .
`` We want to go into the sale to third parties , '' said a post-speaker on Friday .
The company has been checking for months whether to sell its own StreetScooter , with letters and parcels , to other companies .
Post CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said there were always questions , for example by craftsmen .
According to information from the news magazine `` Der Spiegel '' , the Bonn Group will soon be entering the mass production of the vehicles .
In post-production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and set a long-term goal for a complete changeover to environmentally friendly vehicles .
`` We will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , '' he said at the end of July .
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet .
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany 's roads since 2014 .

Destination Records : who actually buys records ?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates .
Before you rush to the comment section to sneak it out under the pseudonym NotAlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters with harsh insults , this statement is derived from current data .
According to YouGov , the much-discussed re-emergence of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects , but to mid-life nostalgia .
Those who have recently purchased a plate are most likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54 .
In fact , the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
It is also not a hordes of hobbies - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But do you agree with the results of YouGov ?
If this blog were a news report on TV , I would follow the camera as I walk in the middle of a bustling street in Soho , wear a modest gray suit and stalk wildly before I stand still , hold my hands and say something definite like , `` Let 's take a closer look . ''
So , let 's take a look at it .
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent vendors were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specials .
I would probably ask the camera man to turn off the camera for the next part , where I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three middle-aged men ) to Reckless Records , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
Is he a collector , I ask ?
`` I guess , '' he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
These records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e-mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again to buy items that he sold when he was young and broke .
`` Many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . Things I was probably a bit too young to buy them to me , '' he says .
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend their own time , and adds , `` I do not smoke and I do not drink very much .
This is my vice .
Wez , 25 , who works for Sister Ray , also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile .
He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hit , people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy their old records again .
From the conversations I have conducted , people have usually departed from their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , `` he says .
This would explain the boom in followers of the plate revival of a certain age .
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people .
According to Wez , some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system .
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , of objects that evoke happy memories .
`` I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , '' says Wez .
This is so with me as a collector so and I think that it is with many people like that .
It is an easy way to mentally deal .
`` We are like their social workers ! '' A colleague from a plate pile out .
A survey by the ICM in April reveals that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not listened to it yet .
The survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I leaf through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , who works for Sounds of the Universe , has noticed a `` trophy aspect '' of the revival .
`` Someone just came in here recently and said , '' I do not have a record player , but I 'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf , `` he says .
This is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
More product-compliant , less music-resistant .
We have people who say , `` I do not have a record player . ''
These are younger people , not older ones , who are only slowly coming .
Fopp , who has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a colorful audience when I go .
There are couples around the 70 , tourists taking photos , teenage boys and middle-aged women .
Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast 's newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz booms out of the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers .
None of them looks very lonely , but gnawing mental trauma is hard to pinpoint when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been running around the shop for several minutes and is looking at the variety of plates available for sale .
It is more like a window shopping than a big shopping .
It does not earn much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
It costs a lot .
It 's easy to hear music from a computer or some other way , but the beauty of records is ... `` she drifts off with a sigh of love .
I do not know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : Urban Outfitters .
While I seem to be looking at the jeans hotpants , I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player .
To the left is a staircase , a wall full of Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
It is pure `` plate art '' .
But considering that any attraction for these items could make more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more , there is nothing to complain about .
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates .
Even though my research has shown that the results of YouGov are right , at least in record shops in Soho , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums are disregarded .
These people probably work hard in school or in offices .
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street records and leafing through plates , while avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie , thirty-year-old fake presenter who stands out over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men .

Intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play `` The Invisible House '' .
The association Nima 's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
Nima 's association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
The `` International Class '' of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a performance of the award-winning play `` The Invisible House '' by the Junge Theater Münster .
In the context of the `` Intercultural Journey '' initiated by Nima 's association , 19 pupils from eleven to fifteen years attended the production in the Kleine Haus .
Since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set up the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster during this project .
Most young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German .
Thanks to the choreographies , scenic pictures and video animations , they were able to follow the course of the action nevertheless , according to the press release of the Boys Theater Münster .
The association Nima 's , founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel , and the Junge Theater will cooperate in the coming season as part of a musical theater project .
From October to December , young people with and without an escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music .
Offers for children and families in the area of theater play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning stage .
The project `` Intercultural Journey '' continues .
In view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes who want to participate .

London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , reportedly died in Syria .
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned a few weeks ago of her death in Raqqa , Syria .
It was believed that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa , the bulwark of the group in the country , ITV News reported Thursday .
Sultana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England .
`` One can only hope that the only good is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to keep people from ever making that decision , '' said Akunjee .
In February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the East of London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultana 's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .

Woman crossing presumed suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night .
The police call witnesses after a woman was crossed on a highway in the early morning hours on a presumed suicide of several vehicles .
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight .
A woman lay down in the dark `` in an act of despair '' and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vaud .
It is obvious that a Swiss woman , aged 49 , who was crossed by several vehicles , including a truck , herself wanted to kill herself .
She still died on the spot .
Several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said , calling on them and any witnesses of the incident to report .
An investigation was opened , which is a `` logical '' step in such a situation , Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve .
However , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
Was a clash avoidable ?
This is something the prosecutor must decide , `` Hofstetter said .
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible .
In each of the two cases - where a person was running on the highway in the dark - it was decided that the car drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian would run on the highway in the middle of the night , as the newspaper said .
Last year , a policewoman was released from negligent killing after she had killed and killed a man who was staying one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014 .
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , the court heard .
The court noted that the policewoman - who had responded to an emergency call - was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a `` completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , '' the judge said .
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .

Greenland Shark : The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks usually only reach the surface in winter .
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna .
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland sharks do not get offspring until 150 years .
The greenland shark swims slowly along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of 1,220 meters .
Only when it comes to it , the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is at this top speed half as fast as a seal .
This lifestyle , however , characterized by slowness , seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the magazine `` Science '' from a Greenland shark , which could be 392 years old .
`` Insanity '' , Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span , which means a world record for vertebrate animals .
The evolutionary biologist has for a long time assumed that Greenland sharks are becoming stale .
Only the evidence was missing .
Greenland sharks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitzbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
Little is known about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks .
Their time-lapdog measured them when , before Spitzbergen , they equipped six animals with a transmitter .
However , these sharks are still prey : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , while another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice and seek carcasses staggering from higher water levels .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks , which caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013 as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest measured 502 centimeters .
In order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the shark core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method .
This center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks , the proteins contained therein are not renewed again later .
The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lins core .
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempted to throw larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
In the 220-centimeter-longest third , the Linsenkerner contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
All larger Greenland sharks , on the other hand , had normal carbon-14 levels in their lime core , caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
In fact , the carbon 14 o'clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years , while the record shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old .
It is known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters .
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
Since one of the animals at 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined to be 156 years , Greenland shark with the increase is evidently at least one and a half centuries .
This is also likely to be a world record for invertebrates .
It is no coincidence that such Methuseums live mainly in icy waters .
Also the previous record holder , a 211-year-old Greenland whale , in whose bacon on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was stuck , was caught off Alaska .
Due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there also often runs on a spar flame .
So they mature later - and age slower .
To keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often also particularly large .
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses warmth .
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant .
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies .
`` A smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , '' explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein .
A very large animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources in a long life .

The £ 2 per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time .
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
The medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , which reduces the risk of stroke or further heart attack .
The NICE regulatory body of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
The NICE regulatory body of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke .
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the arterial walls that form deposits .
When the pad breaks apart , it can cause a blood clot that clogs blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack .
As the blood clot dissolves , it can flow through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
People who already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having a further one .
Ticagrelor , produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely .
NICE 's guidance , published today , recommends taking 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months , followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : `` Despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . ''
The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . The guidance draft does not recommend treatment beyond this period .

The USA win the fourth match in women 's field hockey , a showdown with the UK is about to come
One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of the women in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won 3-0 .
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but Bam ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever having done so .
`` I have no idea , '' she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
But she knows this : the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British in the first place , who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan .
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals , the match will decide which of the two will get the first and second place in each group of six teams .
The first place finishes the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way , the other group lead .
Whatever the game may be , the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story , four years after landing at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
Bam was part of this team .
She grew up in Bluebell , Pennsylvania , and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time at the age of three ( her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University ) , at 16 she became a national player in the US , the youngest in the team 's history .
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad .
Then came the year 2012 , in which everything for her and her team went wrong .
The following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , became the coach of the national team , and with that , things began to change .
`` A cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , '' said Bam .
We did not have the workspace in London that we now have .
We 've been able to pull the helm completely .
On Thursday evening Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a backhand stroke from the close range .
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in their hands .
She made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then pulled the ball into the goal to get the Americans a 2-0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA , Jackie Briggs , who had to score a goal in each of the previous games .
She has a run .
Just like Bam .
`` We are in a good position , '' said Parnham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .

Escape : `` Every fugitive woman has experience with sexual violence ''
Sexual violence is almost everyday life for women who are fleeing alone .
When they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatized .
A house provides refuge .
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
Each has a baby that is at most one year old .
One has put her little son in the arm .
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes .
His mother is staring at the table .
Until she realizes she 's being watched .
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one .
The scene is normal .
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr .
She is the area manager of Condrobs , a social aid provider in Bavaria , and is also concerned with women on the run .
The four women in the kitchen are fugitives .
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-women and their children in Bavaria .
In January , Condrobs set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women 's Aid .
Recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
There are no men - neither as visitors .
The exception is a guardman outside the door .
`` It is no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , '' says Bahr .
`` Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they face torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope-bearer , '' she says .
In women , there are other reasons for the escape : `` Many steal themselves stealthily because they see no other way out '' .
In their homeland , they have had experience with sexual violence , forced marriage , honor murder , slavery , or compulsive prostitution .
This drives them away .
On the run , this continues .
`` That tugs , for example , demand a sexual action for a bottle of water is not a rarity , '' says Bahr .
And the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
Who believes that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , is wrong , says Bahr .
Again , single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and , at worst , abused .
As a result , around 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich are traumatized , she says .
`` Some of the children have certainly not been born voluntarily '' .
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
`` Or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . ''
Since they often would not be able to help , they need more accommodation only for them , Bahr asks .
In Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees .
When asked whether they knew about a project similar to that in Munich , some responded with no .
In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodation .
Even in Swabia alone fled women are not separately housed , says Karl-Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government .
In Oberbayern , Unter- und Mittelfranken , there are floors or houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children .
The exception is Niederbayern , where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be placed separately from men .
In a study published for the Committee , `` It is very important that men and women are housed separately . ''
`` If the privacy is lacking , or if men and women are brought together , there can be - ongoing '' violence against women `` .
Especially the washrooms should be separate and accessible to women , is the study .
The extent to which women feel this need for protection can be seen in the rush of the house in Munich .
`` Since we got around , we have a long queue , '' says Bahr .
You could easily open a second house .

The UK is bringing silver in the 7-rugby after Fiji brings Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7th rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis , when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling , side stepping , tracking , running , and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
The defeat was sweetened by the not so bad trophy of the silver medal - the UK 's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
The clear defeat of the Boks , 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day might fall back on them in the final .
But regardless of this , Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form .
It could be a consolation for GB - but probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow : Fiji 's chief Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult road behind it .
Eight years ago , they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan .
Here they lost only one .
This blow will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderfully and let GB 's attacks bounce off for fun .
It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running in the running buses . The World Series winners went 5-0 up as Osea Kolinisau rushed in the corner .
With another four minutes of play , Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12-0 and GB has hardly tackled the ball .
A prominent tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal , but it has stopped Fiji .
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua leveled a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-start and there was still a one-minute game time ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou broke through the GB team 's weak tackle and went to the line to score a goal .
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break .
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still there .
So it is .
GB made major changes at half time , closing the Fijian gap ... for a full four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interim play from Fiji .
Dan Norton started a test for GB , made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 , but the game had long gone in favor of the South Seesulians whose fans were singing , waving flags and dancing in the stands .
It was not hard to admire Fijis ' playful approach .
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
The whistle sounded , the Fijis embraced each other and GB kicked killingly into the lawn .
Earlier in the day Fiji Japan had defeated 20-5 in the semi-finals and the United Kingdom pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match - Britain 's transformation of the difference .
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the post in the second half .
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson , brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .

Schorndorf : Burglar with helicopter wanted
The police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully .
Two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multi-family house on the Lindenweg at 8:50 am on Friday morning .
The resident surprised the two and struck the monster into flight .
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall , well masked , wearing both blue jeans and black hoodies .
They fled downtown .
The police used several strip crew as well as a police helicopter .
The search was unsuccessful .
Possibly , the unknowns fell before the action near the apartment or during their flight .

Turkey : Kurdish community expects crowds
`` Those who do not adjust themselves and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases , '' says the chairman of the Gülen-based Foundation Dialogue and World , Ercan Karakoyun .
The Kurdish community of Germany expects ten-thousand refugees to flee from Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term it could even be `` a few hundred thousand '' , believes the chairman of the association Ali Toprak .
Because of the harsh Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's move after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass curse to Germany .
`` In the short term , I am counting on tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , '' says Ali Toprak .
Because the government had already overdue Kurdish strongholds with criminal acts months ago , 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey .
After the defeated coup , secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added .
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey .
`` It can not be that a state that takes refugees themselves produces refugees in their own country , '' Toprak said .
The association commissioner complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish and also in Alevi cities .
With this Erdogan wants to increase the pressure to the remaining Kurds .
`` They are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled for the past hundred years , '' said Toprak , who is also a CDU member .
The prosecutor demanded that the federal government be positioned `` as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters '' .
Also in Germany a `` witch hunt '' takes place against Erdogan critics instead .
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and Oppositionals .
Branding as a Gülen devotee destroys teachers 'and other academics ' professional existence .
`` Those who do not adjust themselves and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases , as well as the Kemalists and secular ones , '' said Ercan Karakoyun , chairman of the Gülen Foundation for Dialogue and Education , the `` World '' .
According to the newspaper , citing figures from the German Ministry of the Interior , the Turks were the largest group of asylum-seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
As of the reporting date of June 30 , 11,386 people were thus and almost 29 per cent of all asylum seekers ( 39,625 ) .
This survey does not contain those who have fled from war , poverty or lack of perspective .
Asylum seekers who are entitled to asylum under the Basic Law are exclusively persecuted , ie , politically , ie from the state side .

Building ground in double pack
The municipal council focused on issues relating to building in the most recent session .
With relief , the panel noted the message from Mayor Robert Putz that `` finally the marketing of the recently shown residential areas can begin '' .
After the land , parceling and development questions were clarified and the applications for surveying were made , the sale of the land in the residential areas `` Straßlweg '' and `` Schönau-West '' ( area Binderstraße - Ausbauabschnitt 1 )
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and senior citizens alike .
As it was said , volunteers are now able to report to the city hall , the council will be advised in its September meeting on the allocation of the parcels .
In order to be able to respond to requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises , in conjunction with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to modify the area plan , which was newly developed in the spring of this year , in some areas .
For example , in the Unterzeitlarn area , the commercial area already identified is expanded by two parcels in the direction of Staatsstrasse 2112 .

Donald Trump explains his allegation that Obama ISIS had been `` sarcasm ''
Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by stating that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the `` founders '' of the terrorist group Islamic State were not serious .
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Presidential candidate of the Republicans as to whether he was in a position to communicate clearly with the American public .
It also brings his co-workers , who strive to protect him during an eventful period , into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant at all .
After making the hint at an electoral event on Wednesday night Mr. Trump rowed back on Thursday 's assertion and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
But in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic .
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day , when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews , he said the accusation was quite serious .
When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it .
The last storm of criticism rages down on Mr. Trump , while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling surveys .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
On Friday , Mr. Trump again tried to return to the subject .
Reporting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would lead to higher taxes , and that he had found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm for his defense .
At the end of July , he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , but he later declared , `` Of course I meant the sarcastic . ''
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed .
`` I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then '' clarify `` depending on how the reaction goes wrong , '' said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates .
I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Trump has assumed a more corrosive tone since his polls have fallen further .
A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist , published on Friday , showed a lead with a great lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida .
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks , he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor .
But while he is increasingly focused on attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trumps jokes have brought his loyal supporters into the uncomfortable situation of facing him , no matter how provocative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , former mayor of New York and one of Trumps ' most prominent advocates , took great pains to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday .
`` I believe what he says are legitimate political comments , '' said Mr. Giuliani , so he was questioned about the truth of Mr. Trump 's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state .
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them backbanks , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , where Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed ISIS to spread by blocking the situation in the Middle East aggressively .
Prior to the electoral campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being bored with each of his words and being biased against him .
He mocked the `` poor , miserable '' TV wizards who tried to understand him and said , `` You can not ! `` .
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump 's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office .

Constitutions are constantly being made in the name of terrorism .
After the latest attacks , Minister of the Interior de Maizière now presents a thick security package .
But what does a toleration status have to do with terror ?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler .
All his proposals are `` politically reasonable '' to the coalition partner , says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package .
They do not overwhelm anyone .
Other , wider points were initially discussed within the parties .
I also participate in it .
As interior minister , however , he was concerned with results and a `` achievable consensus '' within the coalition .
De Maizière , after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach , let a little time pass before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic .
But they are all the more extensive .
Some are already known , announced , targeted : That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new .
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU provisions on passenger data and arms legislation .
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising .
In part , de Maizière is launching a second run for proposals that the SPD has so far failed to do : he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and jihadists with dual citizenship unbutton the German passport .
`` These will be difficult points for the SPD , '' admits the CDU man .
He considers this to be reasonable and does not call for anything that does not have any chances with the coalition partner anyway .
De Maizière also presents a few new ideas .
They have a part in themselves : they are planning rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation .
Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a security check .
In the case of toleration for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to conceal their identity .
Some of this is politically and legally delicate .
There are also things that are still unsung and leave questions open .
And on some points - in the case of the uneven treatment of the tolerated , for example - the question arises : What actually has to do with security and terror ?
Yes , de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror .
But it can not be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees .
In addition , many people were worried about security because of the high numbers of refugees .
And things that people were deeply concerned about could not be excluded even in election times .
The internal security is enormously in the focus .
Only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
The uncertainty is great .
And yes , there are election campaigns .
The Union and the SPD are therefore becoming more and more active in the area of internal security .
In the past few days , the two parties have been high .
Only a nasty dispute over the equipment of the federal police , then on a security policy collection of some interior ministers of the interior , in which the heads of departments also demand a Burka ban and a departure from the dual citizenship .
De Maizière is also concerned here with conciliatory tones .
He did not think anything of a departure from the double pass .
We have pacified the discussion in Germany .
Reopening it is not useful .
And in the case of a Burka ban , he had constitutional concerns .
Whether his own package at all corners is constitutionally determined and whether it is actually `` reasonable '' for the coalition partner , must first show .
There is a lot in it , which could cause dispute .
But the SPD is also currently trying to shape the issue of internal security .
`` The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security '' , says Sigmar Gabriel .

Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the Hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc .
In June , Gilead was released from $ 200 million damages for the infringement of Merck 's two patents related to Gilead 's blockbuster drugs , Sovaldi and Harvoni , after a US judge revealed a pattern of misbehavior on the part of Mercks , including perjury and other unethical acts .
When the lawsuit was filed on Thursday , US Treasurer Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Merck is trying to match Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
The case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Merck were suing each other and took ownership of laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is a new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organization .
She is also a social worker .
Since July , Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach .
The social pedagogue supports the Achim Grockenberger administration team .
It sees itself as a contact for all stakeholders : refugees , work group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Regine Kunde from the work circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful , that Deuschle is now there , the egg laying wool milk , which is mainly a problem .
Thus , a few - less mocking than the many desired areas of the problem - had meant , as the administration wanted to advertise the position .
An administrative expert with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long-time experience in the field of social work , was looking for an egg-laying woolen milkau .
But administrative work is not their central area , says Annika Deuschle .
Above all , it is about organization , working with people on the ground and also behind the scenes , as well as networking activities .
The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks .
It has limited a 50 per cent point to three years .
`` It was high time , '' says Regine Kunde , that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors .
There are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
Soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding homes for the follow-up refugees who have been recognized for some time .
The local authorities are responsible for the connection .
They must place the refugees in their own or rented premises .
The costs of building , renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
Responsibility changes from Landratsamt to municipalities and job centers .
Problem : There are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
The search has been very difficult for some time .
De facto , the administration does not find any private dwellings .
It does not work so far , but one is dependent on private apartments , according to Deuschle .
Therefore , municipal housing must be upgraded as it is so beautiful .
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße .
But only with apartments is it not done .
Perspective is the keyword , Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree .
In addition to a permanent place , there are placements , training places , school places , one-euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be found or established .
`` More places would be good , '' reports Regine Kunde .
Many work in the construction yard or help housemasters , do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat , as Annika Deuschle reports .
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
This is `` no occupational therapy '' .
But work does not just mean work .
The day needs a firm structure , says Deuschle and customer .
People would have to develop a sense of belonging .
So it needs such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
Professional courses are rare .
So here , too , administration and honorary officials are taking part .
It is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
They have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can bridge the time meaningfully , for example with language courses .
Anyone who develops the feeling that he can not help anyone in Urbach , should not work and be useless , will never integrate .
The clear majority is motivated .
But there are also problems , says the customer , `` people who do not mind . '' The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others .
This is already a `` mammoth task '' .
A difficult question : do they have fear of radicalization after the recent occurrences , even in a small municipality like Urbach ?
`` No , '' says Regine customer clearly , `` what may be called naive '' , but a residual risk can not and does not exclude it .
The helpers were already sensitized .
These incidents are also the subject of refugees .
They are afraid that the assassin will bring them completely into disrepute .
`` They want to show that they have nothing to do with it , '' Regine says .
Many would like to stay in Urbach .
So the main and honorary officials have to look for activities on the ground and in the region .
They always have in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach .
Does Germany need an upper limit ?
To answer this question clearly , the policy shies .
Actually , it is unfair to hire helpers on the ground .
`` In Urbach , we have not yet arrived where we are going , '' says Annika Deuschle .
No new refugees , that would relax the location .
Reginekunde also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already fully utilized to integrate the existing people sensibly .
At present there are about 100 people , mainly young men .
But when people are in need , they need help , both women agree .
The political world situation is so complicated , since there are no simple answers .

The depressing food of the economic crisis in `` a copious meal ''
In March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the presidency , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office .
As a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a taste for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Turtle Turtle Soup .
His menu on this day was somewhat more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding .
`` It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , '' said Jane Ziegelman .
Her husband Andrew Coe added , `` It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . ''
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coe 's last book , `` Chop Suey '' , was about Chinese cooking in the USA , while Ziegelman told her about her life in a dwelling-house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective in her book `` 97 Orchard '' .
Their latest collaboration , `` A decent meal , '' which will be released on Tuesday at the Harper Publishing House , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg 's Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , snappy snack in the Flatiron District , which has been in business since the Börsencrash in 1929 .
Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive bits while Coe , 57 , ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
When the reporter ordered meatloafs , the pair found this to fit into a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression .
`` Rich foods were very popular , '' Ziegelman said .
There was peanut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner .
Coe grinned .
`` It must have been like lead in the stomach , '' he said .
In the years before the Great Depression , the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , was an all-you-can-eat buffet .
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pate was served for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war . `` A Square Meal '' marks the ways in which the country was no longer the landlocked land .
`` It was a time when food became a central , tense subject for the Americans , '' Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
The new budget diet was just as tense as this : the mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became the basic foodstuffs , the Kasserolle as a `` miraculous way to recycle food residues , '' noted Ziegelman , since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
Meat , which for many years was the centerpiece of American cuisine , became a rarely served luxury .
Strange mixtures were tried , as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had precedence over taste or even healthy cooking .
During her search for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with peanut butter .
`` It was not a popular addition at midday , '' says Coe .
Ziegelmann continues : `` It was surreal . ''
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes .
As never before or since , budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - were driving the eating habits of the country so much .
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become `` household policemen '' and meet the challenge of transforming Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
`` A Square Meal '' is a feast of historical delicacies .
In particular , the reports of the government 's response to the starving citizen , such as President Herbert Hoovers 's Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen attitude , are palatable .
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen , he dined like the million-strong man of the world to whom he has become .
`` He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce , '' Coe said .
He ate in an almost gilded dining room , wearing a tuxedo .
He was terribly unrealistic .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife , Eleanor , had not asked him to set an example with his stomach .
As described in the book , the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House bringing the dullest food in Washington , but also one of the most dreary. ``
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , dealing with food , were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet .
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , Ziegelman , as well as on how science was applied to foods .
The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman 's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example , how she could not throw away food .
`` She had a real fear of wasting food , '' Coe said .
Ziegelman recalled , `` She actually made people sick . ''
There was the windbag incident .
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg 's , they and Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pflaumendessert , which President Roosevelt ate at noon .
`` It 's called Prune Whip , '' said Ziegelman , adding that it was a common trick to give a modest name to modest recipes .
There was no whipped cream , just plums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Everyone dipped a spoon into the tough , brown glibber .
Amazingly it tasted not bad .
Coe drew himself up three times .
Like a can-do buddy , he told his wife , `` A few chopped walnuts would help . ''

Asocial family destroyed before deloging social apartment in Saltash , Cornwall
An asocial family left her social home after a delay of £ 50,000 , because she had terrorized her neighbors .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash , Cornwall .
After being forcibly removed from their homes , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state .
The walls had gaping holes , wooden boards were torn open , garbage was scattered on the floor , and graffiti was smeared to the walls .
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy , who works for the Housekeeping Department at Cornwall Housing , said she feared that the apartment could no longer be repaired .
She said , `` It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do not have to live this way .
There are many things to consider , as this property will probably be viewed as not so nice part of Cornwall .
The family is notorious and its reputation is the same .
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police said the terror that the family had inflicted on street fighting with baseball players , intimidation of local residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive cries , quarreling and cursing .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for antisocial behavior in June .
In some rooms of the house , which may be demolished , old rubbish was found
There were drifts in the property , where drugs were traded in the past
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly to the police
Cornwall Housing delighted her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily undress .
The delogation was cheered by facilitated neighbors who said their lives were made the hell .
One said , `` They did not care for anyone . ''
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
`` This morning we could not sleep . ''
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
Now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said the family had neglected to cooperate with the local authorities .
The family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the town hall rubbish and old toys were thrown down
He added , `` It is a shame that the tenant neglected to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration .
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their deeds had to be terribly watchful for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the Devon and Cornwall police , as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear the garbage dumps surrounding the house
In 2014 the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £ 1,700 .
Skeldon was fined for having been guilty of possession of a Class B drug in commercial practice .
She claimed that the money was for a grave of her son , Lee Skeldon , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
After they were without shelter , Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti .
The police say that they will deliberate tenants who do not follow the rules of the house
Angela Crow , from the Devon and Cornwall police , said the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not follow the rules of the house .
`` This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach , as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior , '' she said .
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

B27-Restructuring : Restaurants suffer from blocking
The speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated , there is nothing to complain about .
For those responsible for the construction works , which start at 5.30 in the morning and end only around 8 pm , there is praise everywhere .
`` They made everything quite jagged , '' says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station .
This is a superteam .
There is also no delay .
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time , by the end of October everything should be ready .
We also commend the meeting of those who are responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the setting up of makeshift entrances .
Since the construction site on Monday migrated to the south and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg again exists , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
From Ofterdingen the citizens can now ride the B 27 on both sides again .
The evasion traffic through the village seems to go back .
`` There were sometimes significant complaints , '' says Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King , responsible for traffic management management .
The residents of Bachsatzstraße , Steinlachstraße , Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many crawls were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the signs .
Which led to the fact that some trucks were fraying in residential areas .
Since the speed limits were not met , the municipality increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen .
`` There have been significant overruns , '' says King , who himself knew about the situation on the spot .
Since two to three per minute have been flashed .
The fastest was traveling with 77 km / h in the Tempo-30 zone .
Since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become quieter .
For the businessmen on the B 27 , it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg .
Businessmen do not like to look at the cards .
But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales slumps has left anyone you wondered through .
However , some are more affected and some are less affected .
If you have less to do with the `` end customer '' , that is for other companies produced , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a `` maximum slight decline '' at the Autohaus Maier , but also admits that , of course , the `` running track '' is missing .
The most crowded are the restaurants along the street .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the Steakhouse , formerly crown , finds clear words .
This is already a threat to life .
Not only him , but all the restaurants `` hit hard '' .
The customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil were missing .
We must be happy about every euro turnover .
The sales losses are estimated to be `` well over 50 percent '' .
The road repair had `` thrown back two years '' .
He had had to dismiss half of his staff .
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would have reacted differently .
Instead , Jörg Schmidt , the President of the Government , responded to a question by Göhner about whether there could be a financial compensation , that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27 . Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation .
Göhner knows from other districts , where something more generous was handled .
In all complaints , Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
After all , the family business has been established here since 1715 , he points to the long history .
The fact that other regular visitors are now less frequent , because of the complicated traffic management , can understand .
If you can not go , it is also beautiful elsewhere .
The fact that his regular clientele will return after the end of the reconstruction work has no doubt in this regard .
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history .
Six months of construction work is already brutal .

Data hack : So hackers hack their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently attacking companies - and are doing so successfully .
According to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America , UK and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies have been victim of an attack with blackmail software at least once , in part , several times over the past twelve months .
In Germany nearly 20 percent of the companies were once already the target of a Ransomware extortion .
Forty per cent of the victims willingly paid the pledges required by the perpetrators to use the systems and data they had attacked .
According to Malwarebytes , malware specialists are increasingly specifying their blackmail software for attacks on corporate networks .
If they are successful there , the potential ransom to be extorted is considerably higher than with private users .
`` We are currently monitoring a terrifyingly rapid evolution of malicious software , '' explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the `` World '' .
In 2008 , most malware programs were designed to send advertising .
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves .
First , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the last months frighteningly fast .
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently .
Then the software presents the demands of the blackmailers .
In order to get the final encryption code to the files , the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of the crypto Bitcoin .
But where the personal photo database is at stake with private users , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stands still .
Accordingly , the damage is greater if a ransom is applied .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported a loss of turnover due to Ransomware , 13 percent even had to interrupt the business activity completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
In Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of hospitals .
`` We always tell the victims : Do not pay , you only help the problem , '' explains Kleczynski .
Yet 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay are getting their data back .
For managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of standstill .
The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
In a recent study , security researchers at F-Secure investigated user interfaces and contact with extortionists , and concluded that the perpetrators are trying to build up a kind of customer service to make more money .
They tell their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin , set up free-access support sites or decrypt sample files for free .
And if private individuals are rescinded after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate partisanship and pay five-digit sums to get their data back in encrypted form .
In the face of potentially high and relatively risky profits from Ransomware blackmail , the hackers are becoming more and more professional and are sharing the work , says security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos : `` A single person can write a Ransomware about within a week . ''
However , it is more likely that it is three or four people .
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailer .
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a one-time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
`` The scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and branding can be changed , '' says Wisniewski .
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
We live in a service industry .
So you log into one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
The payment is made per infected computer .
`` Typically , the criminals instruct spammers with the spread , '' explains Wisniewski .
The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies , which secure their data better .
More than 50 percent of the company 's IT staff in the malwarebytes survey rely on file back-ups and scanner software to defend Ransomware .
Accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
`` If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat for successful assessment , the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , '' explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski .
As a result , the damage potential is still much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
In the future , the perpetrators could also tackle completely new goals on the Internet of things .
At the Defcon hackers ' conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control .
In the middle of winter the release of such a blocked heater could be worth a ransom for many victims .
If the perpetrators instead of the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ransomware could become also in the industry 4.0 a topic .

Rio 2016 : Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internethit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games .
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
At the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily out of sight in the TV pictures .
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected .
In the social networks , Habte subsequently became a viral interneethite .
In fact , the 24-year-old finished his lead with a lag of 48 seconds and finished 59th place with 59 starters .
But it was more of a non-athletic figure that drew the attention of the international media .
Why does the 24-year-old take part in the Olympics ?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
This is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries .
Since in Ethiopia most athletes are running , Habte simply wanted to do something different .
Preparation is everything : Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race .
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds .
Some media called him `` Robel the Whale '' .
The English tabloid `` The Sun '' made fun of `` Dad Bod '' on the basis of a `` prosperous belly '' .
His time , he did not hit the 100 meter free-kick with a minute and almost five seconds , did not matter .
Comparisons with `` Eric the Eel '' were also drawn .
At the Sydney Olympics in Sydney , Eric Moussambani 's run ensured media attention .
Unforgettable was the appearance of the floater from Equatorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a prelude over 100 meters of Freistil alone .
Frenetically , Moussambani was fired at the time .
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Haigerloch : Pilgrimage to the Porte of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg .
Together , four stages were completed .
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all the ministries in two years , the upper ministry of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage of several days .
Various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the bishopric city of Freiburg , where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the open gate of mercy at the Freiburg Cathedral .
16 Minis from Bittelbronn , Gruol , Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off .
The previous evening , Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrim crosses , and gave the pilgrimage .
From Horb it was by train to the starting point Villingen , where also a cathedral of Our Lady stands and thus the pilgrim way of the cathedral was entered .
The individual day trips were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
But also on the way , the Minis made a break at the crossroads , chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim songbook .
The parish homes of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays .
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were there for a tasty and strong dinner and breakfast .
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach .
The next day , the stage went to St. Peter , which was the most strenuous route , but had to be descended at about 500 heights and then climbed again .
The deserved reward was in the evening a common barbecue at Badweiher .
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
Visibly relieved and happy , the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy .
With a small impulse , God was thanked here .
At the evening fair in the cathedral the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operator Markus Obert .
After the service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar .
The next day there was still time for the marsh gourd .
In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb .
In the end , all participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience .

Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the board of the bank , the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a backoffice role .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank 's global ambitions .
The bank has since distanced itself , when it had almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago .
During this time , branded `` RBS '' brands have been used to protect other end-consumer financial brands .
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now it has decided to focus more national brands .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized .
In England and Wales , all RSB references , the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest .
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more importance - Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's Military Bank .
McEwan was interviewed by customers and employees in Inverness-shire during an inspection tour .
He told BBC Scotland : `` The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . ''
When the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became a global brand .
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals but local objectives .
Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work with customers under these brands .
RBS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
`` It is time for us to develop into the Bank of Brands , because how do we focus on the internal ( we have asked ) to make it a better bank for customers , '' said the CEO .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
But with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
We can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

Olympics : Tennisprofi Siegemund misses semi-final
The triumphal procession of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter-finals of Rio : the World Cups from Metzingen missed by a 1 : 6 , 1 : 6 against Monica Puig ( Puerto Rico / WTA no .
34 ) , the semi-final of the Olympic tournament .
Siegemund , who was plagued by back problems , could only be able to beat her once again and seemed to be powerless compared to the previous rounds .
On Thursday , medal hope Angelique Kerber ( Kiel / No . 2 ) still had the chance to go into the semi-finals .
The Australian Open winner beat the Briton Johanna Konta ( No . 10 ) .
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis player to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000 .
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of summer games had given it last 1992 .
There was never a German duo in an Olympic semi-final .

Witnesses sought : beverage market in Waldbröl invaded
A robbery attack was committed on Thursday night to the drink market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstrasse .
Under the guise of a firearm , three dark-haired persons , who had masked their faces , demanded cash from the employee of the drink market and then escaped on foot and then presumably with a silver-colored VW Golf .
The police do not tell how much money was taken .
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters large , thus relatively small .
The drink market is directly accessible from the parking area of the Rewe market and is difficult to see .
After the attack , the perpetrators had to run in the direction of Gerberstrasse , Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg , and had fled from the car park opposite the car park entrance with the silver-colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schladernring ) .
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime ( around 7:45 pm ) in connection with the robbery is to report urgently to the police .

A French court has refused an offer from the authorities in Calais to kill dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , home to thousands of refugees .
At a court hearing this week , the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to break down 72 provisional deals in which people within the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and sanitary risk .
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the government-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
They also claimed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the 72 provisional businesses , but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were `` absolutely comprehensible . ''
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food , cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely to feed people `` living in extremely precarious conditions . ''
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
One of the places threatened by tearing down was the Jungle Book Kids ' Café of the Camp , which is run on a non-profit basis , offering 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp .
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids ' Café .
In a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure `` for these children would be a disaster , of which the recent eight years are old . ''
The two aid organizations , Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants , estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to more than 9,000 people , the highest number so far , following a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer .

Old buildings , a few linden trees , between the rest of the cobbled streets : the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight , but the police rank it as one of the `` dangerous places '' of the city .
Walking along the road from east to west , you will pass playgrounds , a freshly painted kindergarten and a health food store .
To the facade of a gray house someone has `` ugly ! '' Sprayed .
Opposite of a Lidl , which is also to be demolished soon , is already built : By 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental housing is to be created here .
Articles about this `` trendy district '' , as the responsible real estate firm calls Friedrichshain , are illustrated in the last few weeks , however , with burning cars pictured .
The house is numbered 94 : Once it was occupied , now the residents have leases , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
In particular , Henkel , the Berlin interior designer , had repeatedly spoken of the project as a `` no-go zone '' for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
After the premises on the ground floor , the Kadterschmiede , had been cleared by 300 policemen on June 22nd , the police patrolled three-week officially with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the street , blocking parts of the street and preventing visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
During this renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms .
On July 13 , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the exultation of sympathizers and local residents .
This summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the citizenry in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about Späti .
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens .
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in the neighborhood since 1999 , and Jana * , who is raising three children , are annoyed by the police .
Together with the inhabitants of house projects , they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification .
It does not sound like a neighborhood , which mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing left .
The ditch , which the Berlin interior designer and the police between house occupiers and their neighbors open up , does not exist so obviously .
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workplace , which today also has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city .
House occupations and the housing projects resulting from them have long been a part of the Kiez : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainzerstrasse , very close to the Riga .
While the Mainzer had been evicted under a large police force in a regular street battles , many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and some are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago .
At the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world in recent years . They now share their neighborhood with GDR-era residents and former occupiers .
This is also evident in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new leases .
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols of this development : they can be seen on inserted panes or freshly painted facades , which were stained with color bags .
No other street was so often mentioned this year together with the words `` left-wing violence '' .
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : offenses such as bodily harm are directed to statistics almost exclusively against police officers .
The majority of the offenses constitute damage to property , which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in a tenement house for the past 17 years next to the controversial 94 , there can be no question of uncertainty .
As for violent acts , it is appeasing : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were not that .
Even the famous burning cars do not exist anymore in Riga .
For the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : `` They help each other , live together on the street and get more from one another than elsewhere . ''
Neugebauer deliberately moved to Riga Street .
That 's why it was so important for the residents to get back to their streets : from the police , the politics and the media , who all of them suddenly claimed the importance of interpreting the district in July .
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer , the street is still being taken away from them : through faceless new buildings in former vacant lots , which the old inhabitants displace .
`` These are ultimately condominiums , which are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well looked after are more likely to live here , '' she says .
`` Violence and destruction , I can absolutely not approve . ''
But what can you do if nobody ever listens to you ?
There is frustration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for people who are attracted to color bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood .
Anyone who pulls should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can complain badly about noise .
All persons with only first names have asked not to be named with their real name

Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany 's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers : New flash units are being tested in different federal states , including in Hesse and Brandenburg , which are supposed to transfer tempo faders particularly effectively .
The futuristic Enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at major areas of accidents where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
For example , at motorway construction sites or temporary bridges with temporary tempolimit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed camera for speed limitation .
However , a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or complicated .
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient : its battery keeps five days with continuous measuring operation , the case data is transferred encrypted over a modem .
With laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously over several tracks .
Variable speed limits as well as transit restrictions by time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
In the high state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling .
So that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also shuffle-safe outer cover disappear .
In addition , a built-in alarm system to protect the speed camera from vandalism .
Since 2015 , the trailer has been tested and used in several federal states , according to Vitronic .
Also foreign authorities are flashing with the new technology : Recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .

Doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunts proposal
The ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute over the amendments by accepting a reformed treaty with the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,000 medical assistants who voted in an election declined .
In July , Hunt had revealed plans to compulsorily enforce the contract , saying the NHS was in a `` Niemandsland '' and any further delay would be detrimental to employees and patients .
The first assistants are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work , in order to improve care at inhospitable times .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the chairman of the BMA Committee for Medical Assistants , reported last night in a communication : `` Doctors continue to have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and refuse to treat all doctors fairly . ''
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty , progress must be made and time is running out .
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through discussions met with the government to take part in repugnance and sometimes to deafening silence .
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just made about last month that his door would always be open .
`` Jeremy Hunt must now act , lift the imposition , and address the concerns of the assistants . ''
If he does not do so , the doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures .
The last strike At the end of April , there were a delay of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nurses and specialists were included to cover the strike population .
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by accepting the reformed treaty with the British Medical Association officials .
The BMA would like a better weekly wage for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , general manager of the NHS staff , called on the assistants to end the strike .
Mortimer said , `` Labor policies do not do very well , but they are already burdened by overburdened teams and service providers , and they only give patients , carers and their families worry , distress and interruption . ''
In the past two months , we have been talking to the Committee of Medical Assistants and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries .
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from work , training , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training leave and gender pay gap in medicine were a sign of how serious the employers , health education England and the Ministry of Health were in respecting the agreements with the BMA in November , February and May .

Patrick Roy returns as a coach of the avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as a Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday , leading to too little co-determination in the team 's decision-making process .
Alternate President / General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision , noting that the club will immediately look for a new coach .
`` In the last three years , I have fulfilled my duties as Cheftrainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , '' said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion .
In the course of the summer , I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team , to give it more depth , to take it to a higher level .
To achieve this , the coach 's vision and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with the organization .
It must also have a right of co-determination in decisions which influence the performance of the team .
These conditions are currently not met .
Sakic , who hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thanked him for his contributions to the team .
`` Patrick informed me today about this decision , '' said Sakic .
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was named the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
He led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the post-season in each of the last two years .
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference .
As the Hall of Fame goalie , Roy won four Stanley Cups - two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .

Russia 's Putin fires staff chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his staff Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov was part of Putin 's closest circle of trust for many years .
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Envoy for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
In a statement from the Kremlin it is stated that Putin had ordered `` the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration , without stating reasons . ''
Anton Vaino , who had been Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
On the Kremlin 's website ( in Russian ) , he was later to be the secretary of the government and the head of the government .
On his appointment he told Putin : `` Thank you for your confidence . ''
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as a state secretary with regard to draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
Convince the smiling faces ?
This step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin 's closest confidants and works for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the KGB .
He was one of the most powerful men in the country .
At a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff would resign at his own request .
But despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
Nobody knows this at the moment .
But the official assertion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , at once to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism .
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin 's website , Ivanov said `` it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to entrust this very complicated post - you could almost say - to cumbersome posts for four years .
As it turns out , I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov took the post in December 2011 .
Previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the KGB State Security Service .
In the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , replacing the KGB , Ivanov was appointed deputy .
When Putin came to power , he named Ivanov as one of five people to whom he most trusted .
Once it was assumed that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin 's second term of office , since Putin 's third term of office would have violated the constitution .
But this post was taken by another close friend of Putin , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president again three and a half years later .

Simone Biles creates gold in his name
Forget the pressure .
Forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all this .
Dynamic on the jumping horse .
Effortless on the beam .
Breathtaking on the floor .
On the whole brilliant .
And now finally also Olympiasiegerin .
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to a multi-task title and magnified the gap between himself and the rest of the world before the eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
Their total score of 62.18 was clearly ahead of Silver Medal winners and `` Final Five '' team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina .
The American women Simone Biles will play on the suspension beam during the women 's singles tournament in the artificial summer at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-combat title and the fifth overall as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment .
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated her sport over the past three years , winning 15 World Champions medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympian Mary Lou Retton said she was `` the best gymnast I 've ever seen . ''
She expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations .
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be viewed as disappointment .
The Americans Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women 's singles tournament in the Olympic Games in 2016 , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired team-mate Martha Karolyi .
Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during her long journey to the top , this is not really true .
Part of their practice - which includes their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio .
This is no accident .
This girl , who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman 's mother during a school trip to the gym , where Boorman trained , became a force .
Since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competitions , a victory that will last as long as Biles wishes .
Even though Mustafina easily led by two twists , the picture bore .
Suspension beams and bodynesses - in which Biles holds the world title .
She picked up again with 15,433 on the suspension beam - and with a 15,933 on the ground put another on it .
Raisman gently embraced her as she awaited her ultimate grief-a pure formality-and tears streamed on Bilene 's brilliant red , white , and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake .
This time , the 22-year-old team captain , who is called `` grandma '' by the Americans , had a lead .
After her exercise , she threw kissing hands at the audience , overwhelmed by a comeback , which sometimes seemed dubious .
As for Biles , the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning :

What the jungle camp has with missing medals in the swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed his opinion on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis .
In December 2014 he had won gold for the first time in the short-track world championships in Doha and at the same time set his first world record .
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has made a protective of his former team-mates .
`` In a country where an Olympic player wins € 20,000 and a € 150,000 jungle king , no one should wonder about missing medals , '' the 26-year-old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
The promotion system in the swimming sport was bad , the doping controls on the other hand very good .
This means that we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the topic of doping or even operate it .
`` I am not saying that the controls should be discontinued , '' he continued .
If he wanted to make a comeback , Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany ( NADA ) .
This is exactly how it should be with countries .
`` If you can not be controlled by WADA / FINA independent controllers for a certain time before WM / OS , you can not participate , '' says the Hamburg-based , who now runs an ice cream parlor .

De Maizière said that after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July , many people were concerned about further attacks .
The state must respond to terrorist threats at the same time .
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
We will not allow the terrorists this triumph .
If criminals had to leave the country faster , it would increase security and strengthen the consent of the population for refugee policy .
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals up to the 2017 Bundestag election .
He also announced a further increase in the number of security personnel , `` in the medium four-digit range over several years '' .
Sympathy for terrorism must be punishable again .
Video surveillance is to be improved , the weapons law is so amended , that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult .
The last-discussed confidentiality obligation for physicians is to be preserved according to de Maizierre 's words .
However , he wants to find solutions in the dialogue with the medical profession as to how the threat to the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psychological problems .
In order to counteract a radicalization of refugees , the minister believes that better social support is necessary .
Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatized people .
For the prosecution of criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Darknet ) de Maizière plans the use of covert investigators .
SPD chief Gabriel said , `` The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . ''
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had clearly spoken out against actionism .
`` This was an euphonium for the CDU / CSU '' , Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funk Media Group ( Friday ) .
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
He considered a general prohibition of full veiling a constitutional problem .
You can not forbid everything you reject , and I refuse to wear the burqa .
Speeches can be made about rules in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
Green-chef Simone Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate with his new anti-terrorism packages the power and capacity to act .
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said : `` Flotations and a tightening of the right of residence are no longer safe for the people of this country . ''

Podolski takes `` Gala '' after Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey .
A warrant of arrest has been issued in Turkey against former footballer Hakan Sükür .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
For the first time after the coup attempt an important football game takes place in Turkey .
Before the match between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : `` Business as usual '' is announced .
Even in the imposition of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government argued that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be impaired .
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
Even before the football is not stopped .
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür , the prosecutor issued a warrant for arrest .
Accordingly , the South Sudan now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sükür is supposed to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen , who is blamed by the President of the Republic , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , for the coup attempt .
It is true that the state of exile , which was initially imposed for 90 days , still applies until October , but in fact this has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks .
The nightly `` democracy guards '' in public places across the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday for finished .
The sport , like the whole country , is divided into the followers and opponents of Erdogan .
Especially fans of the Besiktas workers ' club traditionally do not belong to the president 's friends .
However , the majority of the Turks are united by dramatic experiences in history , which is the strict rejection of military putsches .
Even the fans agree - no matter if their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas .
At the Pokal winner `` Gala '' , Lukas Podolski will be particularly keen to return .
His sporting achievement proved the Cologne in the past season : With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club .
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1 : 0-winner .
The newspaper `` Fanatik '' cheered him : `` He was the best in the square . ''
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his trophy for his team .
Thanks to `` Poldi '' the disappointing season for the record champion was a conciliatory conclusion .
After the preliminary knockout knockout in the Champions League , the `` Löwen '' departed early in the Europa League .
In the Süper Lig it was only sixth .
The season was not good .
The trophy was the only way to win something .
`` We did it and that 's the most important thing , '' said Podolski .
For Master Besiktas , the year went better .
Above all thanks to Mario Gomez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 Sais matches as a Süper Lig goalkeeper .
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old .
The Gomez , who was under contract at the AC Florence and only loaned to Besiktas , had announced after the coup attempt that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM-holidays .
`` If Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , '' quoted the specialist magazine `` Kicker '' Clubchef Fikret Orman .
However , the striker would have to be prepared to forgo a third of his annual salary worth 7.5 million euros , Orman said : `` We can not pay his salary in Florence '' .

Adblock Plus , Facebook in the `` cat and mouse game '' regarding ad blocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass ad blocking , a `` cat and mouse game '' equal .
On Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockages on its desktop , AdblockPlus released a blog post stating that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to recognize ad blockages to determine which part of the page is advertising .
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes .
In a blog post , the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that `` this sort of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the evaders has been ongoing since the invention of ad blockers , '' and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
The fact that the world 's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry .
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe , around 200 million people use ad blockers around the world , nearly four times as much as 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of Facebook 's advertising revenue .
The company has focused on ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook 's mobile app for the social network and Instagram , a spokesman said .
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large portion of the revenue , making Facebook the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
On Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its `` ads preference tool '' to give people more control over them targeted advertising .
On Thursday , Facebook claimed that Adblock 's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising .
`` This is not a positive experience for users , so we are planning to address the problem , '' a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail message .
Ad blockers are a dull means , so instead we 've focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people .

Donald Trump 's election campaign prosecuted after employees allegedly pulled gun
New York : Donald Trumps 's campaign has been prosecuted for allegedly inaction after she was told that her North Carolina campaign leader had shot a gun at an employee in February while she was in a jeep in February .
The incident is described in a prosecution filed on Wednesday in the county court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini , a former software programmer for the campaign in that state .
Bordini stated that he had waited months before the matter would be settled internally before he realized that `` that would not happen . ''
The campaign leader , Earl Philip , `` pulled a pistol , put his right-hand index finger on the trigger , and rammed the barrel in Vincent 's knee-throat , '' Bordini stated in his accusation .
After complaining to local and regional campaign leaders , Bordini noted that at least four others had already had the same experience with Phillip , he stated in the complaint .
`` Weapons do not have to be fired to inflict damage , '' Bordini said .
The prosecution comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a turmoil when he told a North Carolina human being that the `` Secondary People '' gunmen and weapons friends should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were to be elected and appointed judges .
Trumps campaign made it clear that the media had torn out his words and that he would not incite violence .
Bordinis complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for personal injury and permanent mental damage .
Trumps press contestant Hope Hicks could not be reached for an opinion .
Attempts to contact Philip also failed .
WCCB , a local news service in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign worker .
On calls to his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , was not responded .
The Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump has hitherto conducted a controversial campaign .
The procedure is Bordini by Donald J. Trump For President Inc. , 16-CS-14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the Wasserzweckverband `` Veitensteingruppe '' , Ruppert Göller , retires .
The association is regarded as `` exemplary in Bavaria '' .
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
So it was called some time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Rundfunks .
A little later , the government 's water forum paid tribute to the government of underfiles .
The work of the Veitensteingruppe was `` exemplary in Bavaria '' .
Behind all this , Rupert Göller , who has been a member of the Employees ' Association for 31 years , has 28 years as Managing Director .
Now he was retired at the age of 65 .
The Drinking Water Purification Association of the Veitsteingruppe , headquartered in Kottendorf , municipality of Bretbrunn , promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants .
The communities Kirchlauter , Breitbrunn , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach are members of the municipality .
Water supply contracts exist for other cities and municipalities .
The current chairman , Breitbrunn 's mayoress Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , reminded that Rupert Göller was hired as water manager in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Special Purpose Association in 1988 .
`` His tasks have been very diverse , ranging from water pipeline construction and maintenance to office and organizational activities , budgeting , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency situations on weekends , '' the chairman said .
In 1994 , the company announced that it had commissioned and inaugurated the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , refurbishment of high containers ( 1999 ) , new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and partial renewal of water pipes .
There has been no standstill at all , and innovations have been introduced since water is life and drinking water is the most important food .
In her laudation she praised Göller 's faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
He has worked with a lot of Herzblut for his Wasserzweckverband and he has lived the Wasserzweckverband rightly , as if it were his own enterprise .
Just a few weeks ago , he had been able to present the success concept of the group of companies for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district of Unterfranken .
For this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Rupert Göller praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel , who had worked with him for 28 years .
He is the best water keeper and he was a faithful squire .
Together we were an unbeatable team .
As highlights from his point of view , he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose organization .
However , the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the pipe break at the Hochbehälter near Kirchlauter on 3 January .
Here they had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the localities could be supplied with water .
Also the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained , because one filled the high container of Pettstadt with hoses .
The management of the Trinkwasserzweckverband was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter , who succeeded Rupert Göller .

GfK leadership disappears after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is exchanging its chief Matthias Hartmann .
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprisingly .
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chairman of the board of directors , Matthias Hartmann , becomes all the more uncertain as long as the promises he promises do not happen .
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK : Following another disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management , the worldwide number five of the industry is facing a new start for personnel .
GfK 's CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year .
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board , Arno Mahlert , will leave the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
On 1 September , Gerhard Hausruckinger , a member of the Management Board , took over the management board .
He is to officially assume the function of a `` CEO '' until a successor for Hartmann is found .
As a reason for the resignation , the company called `` different views '' on the long-term business policy orientation .
Details did not want to call a company spokesman on Friday .
Who would lead the market research company in the future , is still unclear .
In Friday , shareholders were said to have been disappointed by the disappointing results of the restructuring which had taken place years ago .
Mr. Hartmann has been at GfK since 2011 .
`` The fruits of the restructuring are still not to be seen even after 5 years , '' said it .
In view of the recent poor GfK business figures , any shareholder would be disturbed at some point .
`` If that were the case with BMW , the Quandts would do the same , '' they said .
The company had not been able to stop its loss journey after setbacks in the previous quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .
At EUR 361.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year .
In relation to the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent to 721.2 million euros .
The profit in the second quarter mainly affected the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
The goodwill amortization of 139 million euros , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience division , resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros for the Group .
In the second quarter of 2015 , GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million .

Olympia 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught : Due to a positive doping test , weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland can not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping cases .
An accomplished athlete would have won almost a medal .
Before the seventh day of the competition , the first official doping events became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000 meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically acclaimed track and field athletics competitions , these news come untimely .
The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide , which is used as a masking agent for dopant substances , was already demonstrated by Chen last Sunday .
The International Court of Sports Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
On Sunday , the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly , only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
On Friday Chen would have participated in the preliminaries over 50 m of free time .
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) for the opening of the B-sample and a hearing .
The national association takes the matter `` very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen , '' Xinhua quoted from a statement : `` We will work with the International Court of Justice , CAS , and will accept the verdict . ''
For the first time in history , the CAS is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases .
Also on the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa seeped through , the 33-year-old went thus even on the offensive .
`` I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive . '' This was `` an incredible shock , '' she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT .
She is innocent , `` the only explanation could be food supplements , '' explained the Leichtathletin .
According to the report , the prohibited substance is to be the blood doping agent EPO .
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended , according to BNT , the B-sample has already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov spoke up immediately with criticism of the athlete .
`` I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , '' he said , `` We Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . ''
For example , all weightlifters from the nation who are chronically doping can not participate in Rio .
The event `` Adrian Zielinski '' was announced on Friday and the London Olympian winner in the class of up to 85 kg was tested three days earlier for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone , just like his brother Tomasz .
Both dispute the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
Before the start of the athletes , the Danekowa case is another major blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
The IAAF World Federation had banned the entire Russian team except for one exception for systematic doping , and the Kenyan runners-up race also produced numerous bad news in Rio .
In the swim sport , the previous offense in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes .
Thus Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympian Sun Yang harshly .
`` Sun Yang pisses purple . ''
`` If I see the podium over 200 m of free-range , I will surrender , '' said Lacourt on French radio .
Sun was also at the center of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton .
`` I have no time and no respect for doping scammers , '' he said .
Sun had been tested positively for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014 , but had only a three-month suspension .

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : `` Go where it hurts ''
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern : The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the state parliament .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood .
In 2021 , the Landtag election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwerin parliament has already decided earlier this year .
It is not so stupid as before : summer holidays , heat and the election of the provincial elections - that bites .
The locals , who are to be convinced by the election campaigners , are on vacation .
Most of the holidaymakers who are in the country , on Usedom , Rügen or Hiddensee on the way , are no local people , so they can not choose the state parliament .
There are also practical problems : during the holidays , helpers who hang up posters , blow up balloons , distribute flyers , and finally count votes , can only be troubled .
Until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet to pass the election campaign just past the people .
The hot phase , if one can say at all , has just begun .
And it is also about something : Minister President Erwin Sellering , leader of an SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his office .
The SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU in polls .
What is exciting is how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalition suits .
Sellering , 66 years old and since 2008 government minister , makes an almost inconspicuous acting election campaign , one from his large poster .
He travels around the country , spreads roses and talks a bit with the people , just as his legendary worthless predecessor Harald Ringstorff did .
Otherwise Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the AfD .
Their refugee policy , their `` We create that '' has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists , which is probably going to cost him the nice office .
The CDU , with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lorenz Caffier , has already experienced what it is like to be at the wrong time in the right place .
Chancellor Angela Merkel has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale surveys , Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the north-east .
But the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine-Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern .
`` There was probably the majority of other states , '' complained Vincent Kokert , secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , recently in the NDR .
But it does not pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
Otherwise , the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual election booths at marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons .
This , according to Kokert , plays only a `` subordinate role '' .
The Union has also noticed that you are breaking the ground in the country , that it has to be very hard to find a wire to the people again .
It is like the left , the SPD , the Greens : scarcely available in the vastness of the country .
The advice of the CDU candidate Kokert to his colleagues is , however , also self-explanatory : `` They must go where it hurts , where the people are : Dorffeste , Golden Weddings , every birthday celebration must be used '' .
Because much is at stake , Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign .
In surveys the Social Democrats were last with 22 per cent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and only just before the AfD ( 19 ) .
In the 2011 election the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , small parties with seven percent in the polls , are likely to make the leap into the state parliament .
They turn a holiday virtue into a modern virtue and move their campaign largely into the Internet .
`` Online election campaign , '' states the country 's chairman Claudia Müller .
Otherwise , green election campaigners are on track searching for local voters among tourists .
Silke Gajek , the top candidate , is curving straight with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful .
Your impression : `` Election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment '' .

Rain instead of shooting stars : Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made a dash for the shooting stars in the south-west of Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope .
The night had been badly suited to watching the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain , said the chairman of the Sternwarte Welzheim , Hans-Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
Our hope is on the night of Saturday .
The weather should be good , then we can see many shooting stars in the sky .
The star sheds are Perseids , which at 216000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
They have their name because they apparently come from the constellation Perseus , which rises in the northeast .

Buyers in Primark indignant about woman who tried shamelessly underwear in the shop
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underwear .
In order to aggravate the situation , she looked as she saw it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf .
She continued to rummage through and tried four pairs of underwear in a store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone .
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone , where the woman tried the underwear before putting it back on the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was at the same time in the store , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , `` she dressed again and left the shop without buying anything . ''
She said , `` People could not believe what they saw . ''
Standing in the middle of the sales floor , she took a pair of pantyhose out of the display , took off her own tights and trousers and tried them on .
`` She did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , cheeky like Oskar . ''
`` Everyone stared as she took off the underpants , which she obviously did not like , as she put them back on the shelf . ''
She repeated it with three more underpants , before she finally decided that she did not like , dressed again and went out .
`` She did not seem to mind watching anyone-or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she 'd tried on . ''
Mrs. Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said , `` How disgusting to think that someone taking home pants with another person who was not washed and who was not washed . ''
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added , `` As I 've noticed , the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . ''
`` I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and going out again and not washing them . ''
A spokesman from Primark said , `` Primark is aware of the incident that happened in our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday , August 9 . ''
All eligible products were withdrawn from the sale .

Assistants ' strikes : demands for new labor measures
Representatives of the medical assistants have called on their trade union to approve new labor measures in their disputes regarding a new treaty .
The British Medical Association 's ( JDC ) Junior Doctors Committee ( BMA ) has called on its entire Council to approve more work measures from the beginning of September .
The JDC said that ministers had neglected to address concerns about the Treaty .
In July , medical assistants and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract , which was agreed with the BMA .
He was rejected by 58 % of his members , who voted in the elections .
In a letter to the members , which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained `` persistently calm '' to problems , which led to the contract being rejected .
She said , `` In view of this , the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and to request official renegotiations for all your concerns . ''
In response to the silence of the government , the JDC Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating workflights , which begins in early September .
The disputes led to the fact that medical assistants were striking six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the NHS .
The head of the BMA 's assistant physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract , which had been recommended by the BMA .
He informed BMA members during the meetings , which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and accepted .
After the vote , Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsorily introduced .

Once pushed over the price from the market , Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg , where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi-Fi , but served for 15 years good coffee .
Of course , by the prices from his Bedford Avenue , shopfront was crowded .
The business soap Cherie replacing verb in the summer of 2014 sells soap in the form of cupcakes .
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city .
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , `` I know New York is change , but I still can not believe CBGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business . ''
But if New York is change , then it is also reinvention .
A revitalized verb cafe opened in Greenpoint last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar unpretentious atmosphere .
The coffee is still good .
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a long-time employee of the old cafe , which is owner and managing director of the new cafe .
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outsource , he was excited to do so , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , maintained much .
Verb used the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model .
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment .
He introduced new ingredients .
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and sautéed onions .
There are natural tear-bowls .
The café no longer serves beer , but there are fresh juices .
After nine months , Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars .
`` Many old customers were also ousted by Williamsburg , '' he said .
Recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg before and visited the verb regularly .
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint , she would take the road .
After the verb had closed , she gave up coffee drinking for a while , she said .
`` I realized it was the coffee and the culture that I liked , '' she said .
Now she is drinking coffee again , even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea on this day instead of her usual Iced Coffe , which is another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
He went there before the work and ordered inevitably always the same .
`` I came quarter past seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch , and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter , '' he said .
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he had no grudge about the fact that the soap business had taken over the old business premises .
In fact , the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-boiled coffee of the cafe as an ingredient .
`` I think we 'll go into their offer , '' Rodriguez said .
And the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe .
A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so his new neighbors feel welcome .
The site also has other advantages .
A local juice locale would like to fill the cold-boiled coffee into the bottle and sell it .
There is a chance that the café will expand to an adjacent building .
For many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the cafe closed .
When the new cafe opened , Whitt said the entering of the pub and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming .
`` I had to smell that , '' he said .

According to the investigators , there is a dispute in the Ulm Rockermilieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish passage .

Russia and Turkey : An `` Alliance of Outsiders '' ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions .
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can not deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
There was the hand , yes .
But Putin 's smile seemed to be narrow-necked , and he barely radiated warmth , even for his reserved circumstances .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his `` dear friend '' Putin - according to a report five times .
I could not count it anymore .
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but would even improve .
The next day , a newspaper described Erdogan as if nothing bad had happened .
To me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
But one of Putin 's radiant , lasting coolness showed that Russia 's headmaster had not forgotten anything .
Rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the shooting of a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian frontier through Turkey .
Moscow 's reaction to the time was fierce .
Putin said , accusing Ankara of falling behind Russia .
The offense was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
Reconcile confidence will be difficult , if not impossible .
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
For months , the state-controlled media launched a fierce , unrestricted attack on Ankara .
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
Most seriously , the allegations of senior officials were that Erdogan 's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by the so-called Islamic state .
He vehemently denied this .
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
After all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan , which he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to score a victory .
For Ankara , the benefits of a truce are clear .
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has almost been deprived of his office last month in a failed state coup .
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
But there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
The number has declined by almost 90 % .
In Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed .
They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean .
This week , state TV forecasted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again .
A report in Vedemosti put it as follows : `` Tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ''
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West because it sees its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response .
In addition , there is the ongoing resentment over the snail tempo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West .
The Russian state secretary certainly won in Ankara a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup he demanded support for the elected state organs .
This is a self-evident fact for Moscow , which itself has a profound fear of regime change .
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey , as an analyst once described , to depict the `` alliance of outsiders '' : two countries that are offended by the West and feel badly treated and are now allying .
Nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
The biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played a role as a peace-builder , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both presidents at the press conference said they had not even touched the issue .
The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this .
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator to Syria can be found .
But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , as NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk again .

Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after `` Arab '' call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media upheaval after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli dial-in code , as Arab guests had `` requested '' it from a staff member .
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentation `` Shoah '' left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ .
During his last stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel .
The country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and eradicated ?
Wrote Lanzmann .
Instead , the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel through its own call center .
After an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
The reply he received there `` shocked him , '' as Lanzmann wrote .
The hotel employee said the measure was an `` intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotels . ''
The reason behind this sparked more anger in the director .
`` The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the area code be deleted , '' the clerk of Lanzmann was quoted .
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a `` great disgrace , '' reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung .
We were horrified and shocked by this event .
This is really very shameful .
The fact that this has been the case in Germany in this hotel chain is even an even greater disgrace .
This does not require any explanation .
We expect the hotel `` to draw the right conclusions , '' said the official .
The incident triggered a fairly large response on the Internet , where the people called it a scandal .
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of having `` surrendered '' the alleged demands of Arab guests .
`` Shame on you , '' said another contribution , pointing out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm , is near a synagogue .
The hotel quickly rejected all the allegations and called the incident an `` oversight '' and `` apologized '' at Lanzmann , Der Spiegel reported .
`` There was never a direct instruction '' to not include Israel in the shortlist , `` the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel .
It adds that the country code has now been added .

Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani .
The two Chinese have made it as expected in the final and made the title among themselves .
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would bring the single title to the Five Rings .
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was former SVS-NÖ legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea .
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record , between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them .
They had retired to the grandstand and let their proteges loose in a fair competition alone .
`` The matches up to here I have played for my country . ''
`` In the finals I play for myself , '' Zhang had said , meaningfully .
After the game gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag .
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set really .
Then he determined the tempo on the record and left Zhang as only 13 points .
The superiority of Ma did not evolve into what was to be expected .
But there was nothing to see enough breathtaking ball changes .
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4 : 1 .
The Weißrussse had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov , was then in medical treatment , `` finally '' had to content himself with sheet metal .
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner ( 38/2004 ) and Jörgen Persson ( 42/2008 ) , by the way , had become Olympic-fourths in a similarly high tabletennis age .

Kepler measures the rate of rotation of stars in the Pleiads
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiad stars .
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars are rotating at different rates in the star cluster , as well as the relationship between the rotation periods and the planetary evolution .
`` We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age , and even the history of its solar system , '' said Luisa Rebull , a researcher at Caltech 's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center , Pasadena , in a press release .
The stars of the Pleiads are 445 light years away from the earth .
Many stars in this star cluster , which originated around 125 million years ago , now reach the adult age .
They are now turning the fastest .
At peak rotation rates , these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds .
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
As a star ages , its rotation rate begins to decelerate .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot , such as solar spots .
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars rotating slower than small ones .
`` In the '' Ballet `` of the Pleiads , we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive , while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars , '' said Rebull .
Since the stars of the Pleiadians are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
`` The Pleiad 's star cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , '' said Rebull .
There is still a lot in front of us that we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars slow their rotation rates and , so to speak , hang their `` dancing shoes '' .
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades , which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal .

Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket , which brings him 3,000th win
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday .
He set a milestone on Predilection , which is trained by John Gosden , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race .
He follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry , and Willie Carson .
The three-time winner Dettori , who previously won Ghayyar , said , `` It 's something special . ''
I am very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago .
It 's not a big meeting , it 's not Royal Ascot - it 's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am relieved and very humble .
Dettori takes the rejoicing as he takes the victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy , who scored more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the nine-time Derbysieger , had 4.493 career bonuses
Frankie is one of the best jugglers of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
He has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
He is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charisma has inspired fans for years for this sport .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he already had 6,000 gains , if he were not just a weekend and big tournament jockey !
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB , which is great .
He has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but he is also an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the flag of the British open-air race for two decades .
It was nerve-racking .
A whole lot of big tournament winnings , including his famous `` Glorious Seven '' 1996 in Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban .
Three years ago he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month suspension , but he showed an impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best form .
And he is far from the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue his competitions up to at least 50 years of age .

North sea workers are again taking up talks , and are striking out
The labor battles regarding the compensation for North Sea workers are being suspended as all the parties are putting themselves to the table for a new round of talks , said negotiators .
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
`` Woodgroup , as well as Unite and RMT unions , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute , '' says a joint statement .
We will hold a few full-day meetings over the next few weeks , which will begin early next year to tackle the problems again .
The unions said their last strike , the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure .
The company 's rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014 .
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn .
Shell has dismissed thousands of people for its part , announcing plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it is streamlining its business activities as a result of its merging with British energy company BG Group .
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had been reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes that have taken place in the North Sea since a generation .
The North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
`` In the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , '' he said in a statement .
2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years are expected .

Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable .
At the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer looked for a bit of variety with a few colleagues and a ride on the beach .
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere .
CHIO : `` Golden Sportpyramide '' for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes , the horses remembered on their evening 's eve , and they hunted home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop .
One kilometer at this rate , I was afraid .
`` It was not a good experience , '' says Langer .
And then the riding career ended again .
On Saturday , Germany 's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
He and his family ran across the ALRV , and he did not even swing on a horse for photographic purposes .
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHIO .
The reason was quite convincing .
The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sportpyramide to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala .
The sympathetic athlete is not lacking in awards .
Federal Tour Cross , Silver Laurel Leaf , Champions Tour Player of the Year ...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him .
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the Sportpyramide .
In Aachen he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday .
`` This award means a lot to me , '' says Langer , `` because it is awarded not only for sporting success but also for social commitment '' .
Langer has been supporting the new generation for decades .
And so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros the same .
With 15 other outstanding athletes , the two-time US-champion was taken to the `` Hall of Fame of German Sports '' on Saturday .
Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt , the gymnasts Eberhard Gienger , the fencers Cornelia Hanisch , Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt , the rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe , the bob driver Meinhard Nehmer , the Judoka Frank Wieneke , the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous handball player Erhard Wunderlich .
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
After the official part the illustrious company went to the jumping stadium , where the Lavazza prize was running .
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals .

Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly : `` It gets better ''
Like most 6-year-olds , Edmund Picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
But like most of his contemporaries , Edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy .
When he first came home , my first thought was , I can not do it .
I can not do it .
I have not let myself go .
What is not at all true , of course , has been the case , `` she said .
Her husband Vincent and her was informed that Edmund may never recognize them and that he may not even survive .
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it .
`` My first answer was 'I did not know people were still doing it , ' '' Picciuto explained .
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until he was three years old , and he still can not speak .
But he is making progress slowly .
He can run with support and bike riding .
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has designed for `` Please sing me something '' . ``
`` We 're teaching him language , '' Picciuto told CBS News .
But it is not a typical sign language - she says . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
Microcephaly has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the cicavirus during pregnancy .
The symptoms and prognosis may vary widely .
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the zikavirus .
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
What will happen ?
And she still does not really know .
I have not asked for the prognosis for a long time , because I do not expect anyone to really tell me .
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus .
It gets better .
You know it will be better for you .
You will love your child and your child will love you .

Mahaj Brown , 6 , `` Shot of Balls '' , survived the shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time a 6-year-old is being shot .
The boy 's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown .
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several bullet injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm , and tummy , but that he was conscious of his transportation to the hospital .
`` He 's been through a lot , his little body was pierced by bullets , '' his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station .
I just can not believe it .
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries .
The boy 's family told the channel that he was expected to recover .
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown .
Three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old .
One of the 29-year-old men is in a critical condition , the other two victims are stable according to CBS Philadelphia .
The boy was found shot on the front seat of a car with the 29-year-old , who is in a critical condition , shot , the transmitter reports .
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it had apparently come to a crossfire between several shooters .
Cartridge shells for storm guns , which were traced back to various storm guns , crossed the scene .
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
On the road , on both sides of the sidewalk , there were sleeves .
So there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very active , `` police police officer Anthony Ginaldi told the police in Philadelphia .
Several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
There were no arrests and the police are currently investigating the surveillance video .
On Tuesday , another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-legged arm as she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect .

Crazy about Kates Radler-Doppelgängerin and other famous doppelgangers of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have been out of bounds this week by the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot , who proved to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge .
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only gold-challenged athlete to have his own famous double - at least not if one is to believe the social media .
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens , FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities .
The Hunter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison , left , has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate 's double-decker on the cycle track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio .
The team member of the US team at Archery Brady Ellison has caused an onslaught on Twitter after appearing pictures on which he looks eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
In fact , the archer got the insanity in the social media and admitted that since his childhood he has been hearing that he looks like Leo .
`` I do not see any big resemblance , except the facial hair , '' Brady told the Huffington Post .
`` He 's a handsome guy , so I 'll take that as a compliment . ''
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more important this year : the striking similarity between the British farmer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big , expressive eyes is to be able to go as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan .
And in the swimming pool the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years to the Glee star Matthew Morrison .
One higher : This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the `` athletic version '' of the Inception 's actor
Another persistent match was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett , who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips .
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-blown skin and blond hair like the actress Annalynne McCord , while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to an `` athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt '' .
Strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one : A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory in the room : According to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that `` the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical . ''
In fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes .
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile , almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney , as well as the gold medal winner in gymnastics Gabby Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile resembling that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

Berlin / Schwerin : Survey before country elections : SPD and CDU lose
In the forthcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are expected for the SPD and CDU government departments .
This was the result of representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute INSA for the `` Bild '' -Zeitung ( Friday ) .
While the red-black government coalition in the north could be just a little further , this is not possible according to the polls in Berlin .
In both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to head the government .
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
According to the poll , the party would therefore be just ahead of the CDU , which could again reach 23 percent .
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD .
The left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.4 percent ) , the AfD would be represented for the first time with 19 percent in the state parliament .
Despite the slight losses , the Greens returned to the Schwerin Landtag with 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) .
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 per cent each .
According to the poll , the SPD would only reach 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.3 per cent ) in the Berlin parliamentary elections .
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent .
It would thus still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.6 per cent ) , but before the left with 15 per cent ( previously 11.7 per cent ) .
At 14 percent , the AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives .
With 5 percent , the FDP could hope for a return , but the pirates , contrary to 2011 , would miss the entry .

Amidst the rage of the Olympics , the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are , whatever time it is , it is the Olympic Games .
The events in Rio de Janeiro are a constant and inevitable one , a fast-paced relay race between competition and aspirations .
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning stick , which is passed from the crossbow gun to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete .
You can not turn on the TV , read a newspaper , or listen to your neighbors ' conversation in the queue , without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky , or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then there is Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who is part of the Olympic Games for the first time , and a swarm of women with dimples , could well have been among these well-known names broadcast at prime time by sponsors and well-being TV advertisements if he were a swimmer , gymnast , or even fencer .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is struggling for gold in the Olympic trampolines .
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event alike .
Further from the center , partly in shadow are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air gun shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
We will always have the breast-float and may it be long .
But if I could make modest arguments for my particular favorite , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
Although trampolining has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it debuted in Sydney , it has been so scantily perceived for the last 16 years that many of whom I interviewed did not know that it was an Olympics sport at all .
This could also be regional ignorance .
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in trampolines , and by 2012 an athlete has made it to the finals .
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women to share .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympics for the unsupervised ear .
At this point , I should admit that I am not an expert but only a ground-based enthusiast .
It has humorous potential - the cartooning trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it .
The word `` trampoline '' comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means `` jumpboard . ''
Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have a series of falling movements ( turning , pikes and somersaults ) before they land on their feet .
They are rated according to official Olympic program after execution , difficulty and `` flight time '' .
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
The most common olympic vector is straight .
In their pursuit of gold , medalists have to go farther , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
They hunt not only the target line or the exit wall , but also another sarcastic goal in television broadcasting : the world or the Olympic record .
The purposeful pursuit is classy , admirable , even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears .
But it is also what I feel when watching these games as a bit tiring .
The trampoline offers an Atempause .
The vector of the trampoline pringer is up .
A forward movement is not the goal .
He or she bounces off , seemingly weightless as an astronaut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly up again .
Here , too , there is competition , not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no vaulting into the distance , only the dreamy , elegant elimination of time and power .
It is as Zen as competition in the Olympics can be .
Women 's qualification and finals will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time , and the men 's on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
In the midst of the Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is generally troubled .
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the assertion and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts according to The Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Mr. Dooley expects his air-confronting , new fan base .

Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious examination of his immune system and gag reflex - licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe .
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk scraped his train on a euro bill , a railcaster at Piccadilly Circus , a flush button of a train toilet , and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system .
Before licking each object , he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to do .
But the experiment , which was filmed under the title `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' , brought some surprising results to light .
The idea of licking the flush button of a train toilet , already used by thousands of others , may be completely repulsive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
On his journey through Europe , Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Darmbacteria and his own health .
Fortunately , nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowel by traveling throughout the world and eating strange and miraculous things .
From public railings at railway stations to flush buttons of toilets , the task put his immune system definitely under a sample
In the film , he said , `` Already as a child , I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ''
In the film , he certainly lived up to his reputation .
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units .
In comparison , the luminometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after their luminometer count was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the travel film `` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' , which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film , he says , `` This is close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet . ''
There 's nothing dirtier than that !
I will not lick anything here , because it is disgusting inside .
`` The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength '' was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio .
The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus , which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of Darmbacteria and the immune system .
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks , Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : `` We really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics .
We went through crazy brainstormings that ended with saying `` Let 's call Ian . ''
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hakala , who directed the film , added , `` Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick , like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film . ''
Of course , there were things that made it easier to get Ian licking them and others that were quite difficult .
I 'm glad we took some of these filthy treats on film. ``
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015 , 84 % of all lactic acid bacteria responded , particularly with the well-being of the stomach and intestines , and 58 % said they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria included .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Slow Motion : Nokia Communicator came onto the market 20 years ago .
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
It was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
On the contrary , it was quite chunky .
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes , which would today be enough for about two high resolution self-help .
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes .
The `` Nokia 9000 Communicator '' arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
For a few euro lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet .
Twenty years ago , however , the communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as `` office in the Western pocket format '' .
In fact , the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax the communicator could be reached .
Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , although tormenting slow .
A pocket calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop .
Then found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen .
Pretty proud was the price : 2700 D-Mark , thus about 1400 euro .
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros .
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
Since then everything has changed .
The smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
The market now dominate providers , which all came much later than Nokia .
To be online always and everywhere , this is everyday life for a lot of people .
In 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
It sold approximately 1.4 billion units , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units .
Worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros .
In addition , the well-running business of the numerous app providers and the telecommunication companies .
Around the smartphone , a whole industry has emerged .
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac-World the introduction of the iPhones .
He promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communicator , all easy to use via touch screen .
The triumphal procession of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , who dominated the market , had the look .
They finally disappeared , Blackberry has to fight .
The saying now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
On average , today every German looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
`` We must all learn to put the smartphone away , '' said Janina Kugel , responsible for personnel at Siemens .
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .

There are 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country 's most vulnerable are refused annually by the municipalities , while the industry is focusing on the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions .
In Queensland , three out of five people - mostly elderly persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violent acts and those who have no means of unfair detention and the like - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal aid .
Legal services of the municipality , which are already exhausted , are preparing for further reductions .
As of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
The director of Queesland 's communal center James Farrell said that the latest survey of the National Association of Town Centers showed that thousands of people are already rejected every year .
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without repealing the decision of the federal government .
`` Queensland 's community centers are chronically under-funded , which means that thousands of people are being rejected by important services you need , '' he said .
People who leave violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crushing debts , families who go through divisions , workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature , and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need .
As of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of more needy Queensland people will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
We call on the Federal Prosecutor 's Office , the Federal Ministry of Justice , and the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately abolish these cuts so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems .
Last year the state government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
It is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their customer communities , as well as to invest the Palaszczuk government into this important work .

Condoms with chilipuder , fireworks body promote Tanzania 's elephant protection
Conservatives in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from moving into populated settlements - they throw condoms filled with chilipuder .
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation , which had the idea years ago , has intensified its support with US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals .
Previously , many spears have been used to defend themselves .
Friday is Weltelefantentag , dedicated to animal protection .
`` Since we developed the ... toolkit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant , '' said the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell .
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing it into a horn .
If it is not quenched , a so-called `` chili cloud '' is thrown .
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body in a condom , the end of which is turned up to the fuse .
When it is lit , the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust to chilipuder into the air .
A hint quite usually already out to chase the elephant .
One last possibility is a throwing gun that shoots a gun of gold in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

Police : 3 casualties in series murder case when listening to music in the car
According to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12-year-old girl who had been killed in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in Phoenix 's first serial murder case were shot while they were talking in the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelliner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis 's daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 , while the car was parked in a driveway , the authorities said .
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-held firearm while he was standing on the passenger 's side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , to be read in the report .
The police said the three-man murder had not been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
The police officer of Phoenix Sgt . Jonathan Howard said the shooting caused the investigators to take a closer look at whether it was connected to four previous attacks .
In total , seven people were killed and two others injured in nine instances , mainly in Hispanic districts .
`` It happens in a residential area in front of a house , '' Howard told the KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , earlier this month .
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles , including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990ern and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized for her injuries and died later .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis 's daughter , Maleah , died on the spot .
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-killing , and is said to be the work of the serial murderer .
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .

Bombenterror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schnöll , Freitagfrüh .
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but she had already left her .
She planned her return home for the beginning of September .
Whether the further explosions on the tourist island of Phuket , as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon also Austrian citizens are affected , is still unclear .
The foreign ministry is in constant contact with local authorities , says Schnöll .
In the Hua Hin , about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok , two bombs exploded in a nightlife area on Thursday evening .
According to police , a Thai woman was killed and some 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutchmen and three Italians .
On Friday morning , another two bombshells went up again , according to the authorities , another person was killed .
A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning from Phuket .
At the detonation near the Patong beach , which was popular with tourists , a taxi driver was injured .
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country , another bomb exploded , killing an urban employee .
According to the authorities , the blast gun had burst into the air in a flowerbed in front of the police station .
Finally , detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injuries .
They are talking about a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin , they said .
`` The bombshells carry the same manuscript , '' said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists .
`` We assume that this is a coordinated attack . ''
It was too early to comment on possible motives - but probably the deeds of Muslim rebels .
In the attacks , Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
The Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the assassinations were not related to the Islamic uprising movement or to international terrorism .
`` This is only local sabotage , limited to limited areas and provinces , '' said a spokesman in Bangkok .
Rather , it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta .
The authorities had received intelligence in the past few days about the impending attacks in the south of the country , but they had not been informed of the exact date and places .
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
The police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
In Thailand there are always small bomb attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
In Hua Hin lies a palace , which was used for years by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
After the recent bomb explosions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its website recommends that the Thai security authorities strictly follow the instructions .
High security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area .
After disputes between the security forces and the Muslim population , it is advised not to travel to these provinces .
Increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta .
This will also give the military great influence in the coming years .
Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos as the country moved towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
The militia , which had taken power after a period of bloody unrest in 2014 , has benefited itself in having restored the kingdom to stability and order .
However , the military has not succeeded in getting to grips with the rebellion of Muslim rebels , which has been smoldering for years in the far south .
In the conflict , more than 6500 people have already been killed .
Just over a year ago , 20 people were killed in a bombing of a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists .
It was the most bloody attack on the country 's recent history .

Queensferry Crossing : Bridge now connected with Fife
The £ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the Norddeck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct , which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife .
It is the first of four closures of the `` deck fans '' approaching the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge .
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 sloped cables .
The £ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to get on the bridge from the country .
He said , `` This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing .
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
In total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge deck is in place , and the last section of the deck now receives a concrete bet for the deck in Rosyth , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge .
Michael Martin , Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors , said , `` The first shutter is a significant milestone in any bridge project .
This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented civil engineering and civil engineering .
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nordturmdeck , we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side .
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south .
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
Massive , as the viaduct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3 % .
The problem was that the tolerances to which the team was working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters .
Fortunately everything went very well .

Frankfurt is benefiting from Brexit
As a result , the City of the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London , in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
`` It is very likely that Frankfurt will profit most from the Brexit vote , '' says Michael Voigtländer , head of the financial services and real estate markets of the IW .
After the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether financial institutions are allowed to continue to operate London financial transactions throughout the EU .
For the so-called EU passport , they have been granted authorization in Great Britain .
This is being used by large US banks .
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs .
The lobbying association `` Frankfurt Main Finance '' expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
For Frankfurt , according to the IW , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which is responsible for the monetary policy and supervision of the largest eurozone banks , and other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board .
Although the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) is based in Paris , it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
`` The proximity to the bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervisor , '' says IW-Professor Voigtländer .
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector , it is worse off than infrastructure in Dublin .
Thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
The city also scored points with easily available commercial properties .
`` In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices , '' says Voigtländer .
On the Seine , rents for first class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
Mercer 's ranking was ranked number seven , Luxembourg ranked 19th , Dublin ranked 33th and Paris 37th .
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences : `` With its already strong position as financial center for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , '' concludes the IW .
Despite the Brexit vote , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , according to economic researchers .
This is also reflected by the economic situation . According to the Landesbank Helaba , around 144,000 people were employed in the banking sector at the end of 2015 , while in Frankfurt they were 62500 .

Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Compared : It 's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - this is what both Clinton and Trump want .
However , the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a principle question .
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical , difference .
The , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep the doubt small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to death , he says .
He himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Trump .
He will massively cut back on regulations , and he is making a strong tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , on the other hand , says : `` The state has certain tasks , it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it .
That is why the tax would be increased for the rich , she says .
Interestingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
Trump and Clinton say almost word-for-word .
The Democratic candidate even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans .
At Trump , there might be party-internal discussions .
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the USA .
Oil subsidies should also be possible in protected areas so far , he wants to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand renewable energy with its investment program and calls : `` A country will be the supermarket of clean energy and create millions of jobs . ''
`` It will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be us . ''
But not only in terms of infrastructure , but also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
TPP , the transpacific trade agreement , does not want to sign either .
At the same time , however , both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better .
They are also to be paid for better , says Clinton .
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 is a hunger wage .
It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : The minimum wage has to go up , then he says he should not be changed .
But the great discussion of the coming months is probably more about the tax policy of the two camps .
On the one hand there is Trump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens , to boost growth .
Its critics insist that the budget deficit would be even greater .
On the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least the rich to demand that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : More taxes are not the solution .

During its last stay Lanzmann Israel on the land preselection list of the hotel tried to find .
The country was not listed however between the countries , which can be called directly from the hotel room .
How is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , for the capital of new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?

Looking for an explanation the director turned to the hotel reception .

The hotel employee said that the measure was a “ intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels . ”

That does not require an explanation .
We expect that the hotel draws “ the correct conclusions , ” said the office-holder .

Some subordinated hotel to the Kempinski that it would have given way to the alleged requests of Arab guests “ ” .

“ Who does not adapt and on packed suit-cases ” the presiding of the Gulnear foundation dialogue and world , Ercan Karakoyun praises , sits , says Erdogan .
The Kurdish community Germany counts at short notice on ten thousand protection-searching , which flee from Turkey to Germany .
In the medium term it could become even “ some hundred thousand ” , believes the association chairman Ali Toprak .
Because of the hard action of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the putsch attempt the Kurdish community Germany expects a mass escape to Germany .
“ I count short term on ten thousands , in the medium term on some hundred thousand protection-searching from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdogan regime says the minorities and the democratic opposition further fought ” , the association chairman Ali Toprak of the “ world ” of Friday .
Because the government already covered months ago Kurdish centers with punitive actions , 500,000 Kurds are within Turkey on the escape .
After the defeated putsch still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added .
Many will want to again begin in Europe , if they are continued to suppress in Turkey .
“ It can not be that a state , which accepts even refugees in the own country refugees produced ” , it said to Toprak .
The federation boss deplored the purposeful settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , in addition , in alevitischen cities .
Thus Erdogan wants to increase the departure printing to the remaining Kurds .
“ You are the last large minority in Turkey , those Christian Armenian and Greek already in the past hundred years were exterminated or driven out ” , said Toprak , who is also CDU member .
The federation boss demanded that the Federal Government positions itself “ as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters ” .
Also in Germany take place a “ witch-hunt ” against Erdogan critics .
I do not feel in the last months for the first time any longer reliably in Germany .
The German branch of the Gul movement fears likewise the escape of many Turks abroad .
More Turk , above all Kurds and oppositionals will look for asylum in Germany .
Stigmatization as Gul supporters destroys teachers and other university graduates the vocational existence .
“ Who does not adapt and Erdogan on packed suit-cases , by the way also the Kemalisten and said secular one ” praise , sit , to Ercan Karakoyun , chairman of the Gulnear foundation dialogue and education , the “ world ” .
As the newspaper reports with reference to numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already placed the largest group of the people entitled to asylum recognized because of political pursuit before the putsch in Germany .
To the deadline 30 June this 11,386 humans and thus scarcely 29 percent were everything as asylum-entitled appreciative one ( 39.625 ) .
In this collection before war , poverty or lack of perspectives the fleeing are not .
After the Basic Law are asylum-entitled excluding political , thus from national side , individually pursued .

Still Volkswagen comes through mildly .
Despite Diesel scandal the distribution numbers rise world-wide .
But not in all markets it runs approximately .
With the recall action there is eddy around a term .
Volkswagen starts with the distribution more with restraint into the second half-year .
Of Europe of largest car makers can show in the past course of the year despite the Diesel affair owing to his many brands and some well running markets of a far plus .
But in July the core brand VOLKSWAGEN slacked off particularly in Western Europe and loaded with again the total sale as the enterprise noted in the DAX communicated .
World-wide the brand VOLKSWAGEN sold 1.8 percent of fewer vehicles than in July with 449100 cars the previous year month .
However in Western Europe , to China the second most important market , the sales were 14 percent under the previous year month .
In the domestic market the distribution sagged Germany around nearly a sixth .
Brand distribution boss of Jürgen Stackmann led back the weaker numbers from July particularly to two sales days less into Europe .
Besides it gave a consumer resistance in some nuclear markets by “ changed economic basic conditions ” .
Apart from the situation around the putsch attempt in Turkey also the British vote loaded approximately to the withdrawal from the European Union , described a spokeswoman .
In the USA , where the exhaust affair escalated first , it is located a likewise far minus to beech .
Large support for VOLKSWAGEN is the Chinese market .
Altogether the own brand mainly concerned that comes Lower Saxony anyway further mildly by the Diesel scandal : After the first seven months only a distribution minus from 0,9 percent stands to 3.37 million vehicles to beech .
Company distribution boss of Fred Kappler could show from January to July of far sales sale .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time , world-wide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software .
Alone in Germany VOLKSWAGEN calls approximately 2.5 million car for re-equipment into the workshops .
In the course of the re-equipment VOLKSWAGEN affirmed that the change of the cars does not have negative effects .
After the re-equipment of the vehicles give it during fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance to no degradation .
The car maker issues the customer after the re-equipment a “ warranty-same ” certificate , speak however not of a “ warranty ” , as it meant on Friday in company sources .
Reason are legal intricacies .
“ Focus ” had reported , Volkswagen grants to its German customers now nevertheless a warranty for reequipped Diesel models .
On past Monday Volkswagen representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport would have confirmed this .
From the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
“ VOLKSWAGEN has to fulfill the editions of my commission of inquiry and the KBA at full extent . ”
“ Deviations from it are not accepted ” , explained Federal Ministers of Transport Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) according to Ministry .
VOLKSWAGEN took over the warranty that at fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the re-equipment no degradations to take place and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values invariably existence to have .
Volkswagen does not use the term “ warranty ” however , as it meant in company sources .
With the far term “ warranty ” sees the possibility to Volkswagen the fact that customers come for example a half year to the re-equipment for instance with a damage to the engine into a workshop - and to the new software to attribute could do this , even if the damage thereby has to do nothing .
Also in the interest of customer is important it to avoid that it comes with any other damage , which does not have to do nothing at all with the exhaust scandal to disconcertion regarding possible guarantee regulations , as it meant .
Therefore do not use VOLKSWAGEN the term “ warranty ” .

The whistle sounded , the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kicked destroying struck in the lawns .

Condoms with Chilipuder , fire work promote Tanzanias elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox kind , in order to hold elephants of going into settlements inhabited by humans - they throw condoms on them , which are filled with Chilipuder .
The method proved as effective and the Honeyguide Foundation , which had the idea already years ago in addition , together with the US-nature conservation its promotion intensified , by training volunteer in villages in the north of Tanzania , to use a nonviolent four-stage method for the protection of their houses and harvest without thereby animals to injure .

Old buildings , a few lime tree small trees , occasionally still another rest of cobblestones : The Rigaer road in Berlin Friedrichshain does not work at first sight in such a way , but the police ranks her among the “ dangerous places ” of the city .
If one goes along the road from the east to the west , one goes past at playgrounds , a freshpainted kindergarten and a health-food shop .
To the front of a grey house someone has “ ugly ! ” sprayed .
Opposite of a Lidl , which is to be torn off also soon , already one builds : Until 2017 are to develop here a house with high windows and 133 new rented flats .
Articles over this “ trendy quarter ” , how the responsible real estate company calls Friedrichshain , are illustrated in the last weeks however preferentially with burning cars .
Reason is the house with the number 94 : Once it was occupied , meanwhile has the inhabitants leases , in the ground floor is however still areas occupied and for events is used .
Particularly the citizen of Berlin Senator of the Interiors Henkel had expressed itself since the beginning of the year several times for a hard action of the police against the project , which calls area “ NO-Go-zone ” for policemen and the 94 as starting point of autonomous force .
After on 22 June the areas in the ground floor , which had been vacated Kadterschmiede , with 300 police officers , patrolled the police three weeks long official statements according to with 30 to 40 officials and closed three crew cars locally , parts of the road and visitor held from it , the house with the number 94 to enter .
Meanwhile construction workers reconditioned the areas on behalf the unknown home-owners .
On 13 July a citizen of Berlin Administrative Court decided that those had been illegal evacuation , and later police and construction workers under the jubilation took one day off from sympathizers and adjacents resident .
In this summer afternoon the road works peacefully : Parents go walking with children , people sit on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun , other one converse before the Späti .
In direct proximity of the house projects a primary school and kindergartens lie .
Left force is not the main concern of many adjacents resident : Kerstin Neugebauer , which lives since 1999 in the neighbourhood , and Jana* , who nurse here three children , are particularly made nervous of the police presence .
With the inhabitants of the house projects they divide the concern before rising rents and gentrification .
It does not sound after a neighbourhood , which by the majority police protection forwards vandalierenden themselves linking longed for .
The ditch , which the citizen of Berlin Senator of the Interiors and the police between squatters and their neighbours opens , so obviously does not exist .
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker quarter , which has a low average income and a high poverty risk also today in the comparison to the rest of the city .
Also house occupations and the apartment projects born from it belong for a long time to the neighbourhood : 1990 numerous houses in the former GDR occupied , among them almost the entire Mainz road close by the Rigaer .
While the Mainz under large police presence in a proper street battle one had vacated , many were legalized the projects in the Rigaer and are inhabited partly still today by the people , which had occupied them before 26 years .
At the same time that became quarter in the last years increasing the magnet for tourists and choice elections from all over the world : With them now adjacents resident from GDR times and former squatters their neighbourhood divide .
That becomes apparent also with the rents , which rose since 2009 with new lettings around nearly 60 percent .
Many the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development : One recognizes it by thrown in disks or freshly painted fronts , which were thrown with color bags .
No other road was so often mentioned this year together with the words “ left-autonomous force ” .
A reason for it that not all neighbours view that as problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : Criminal offences such as bodily injury are directed according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen .
Damages constitute the largest part of the criminal offences , which meet tendentious rather the new buildings and freshly reconditioned houses .
For Kerstin Neugebauer , which lives for 17 years in a dwelling house beside the disputed 94 , no speech can be from uncertainty .
Which concerns acts of violence , she is appeasing : The people in the 94 are their neighbours , those that were not certainly .
Also the famous burning cars do not give it directly in the Rigaer already longer no more .
For the studied architect its road is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : “ Here one helps each other , lives together on the road and receives more from each other , than elsewhere ” .
Neugebauer pulled consciously remained into the Rigaer road - and .
Therefore it was also so important to it that the adjacents resident its road got back : Of the police , the policy and the media , which suddenly claimed all in July the interpretation sovereignty over the quarter .
But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer the road is further taken away from them : By faceless new buildings in former building gaps , which displace the old inhabitants .
“ Those are finally free-hold flats , which are not interesting for many here - here live rather people , which are not so well moneyed ” , say them .
“ I can not approve force and destruction absolutely . ”
But which one is to make , if never someone listens to one ?
There frustration begins , also with the police and the inhabitants on all sides .
For tightening , which is annoyed at color bombs , Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding : The house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood .
Who pulls , its should be conscious - exactly like someone , which pulls into a bar district , badly about noise to weight there can .
All only with first name presented people asked with their correct name to be called

Frankfurt profits from the Brexit
The city at the Main has therefore in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to attract from London shifted jobs and companies .
“ It is very probable that Frankfurt at most says profited from the Brexit vote ” , Michael Voigtländer , Leiter of the competence field of financial markets and property markets of the IW .
After the Brexit referendum it is uncertain whether financial institutions of far from London financial transactions in the entire European Union may operate .
For the so-called European Union-passport so far the permission in Great Britain is enough to them .
Straight large US-banks use .

For Frankfurt , as the IW , speaks the seat of the European central bank ( EZB ) , which responsibility for the monetary policy and supervision about the largest banks the euro zone unites , as well as further important authorities as European insurance control EIOPA and the risk advice ESRB .
In Paris the organization for economic cooperation and development ( OECD ) has its head office , but this is less important for the financial sector than the EZB .
“ The proximity to the issuing bank is importantly for banks , there it so directly with the supervision to communicate can ” , says IW-professor Voigtländer .
Luxembourg beheimate a large fund sector , fares however just like Dublin with the infrastructure more badly .
Frankfurt is clearly easier owing to the large airport to reach .
Furthermore the city scores also easily available trade real estate .
“ In Paris it is not at all simple so to find free high-quality offices ” , says Voigtländer .
On the Seine are besides the rents for first-class trade real estate around 50 percent more highly than at the Main .
In addition offer to Frankfurt a higher quality of life than the competition owing to good medical supply and infrastructure as well as less crime .
In a ranking of the management consultation MER cerium stand the city on place seven , Luxembourg on place 19 , Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 37 . Place .
Even if quality of life is a question of the preferences : “ With its already strong position as financial location for the European domestic market Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors ” , concludes the IW .
London will remain however despite Brexit vote most important financial center in Europe , means the economic researchers .
But also the balances of power speak : In London Helaba at the end of 2015 approximately 144000 humans in the bank industry , in Frankfurt worked were it 62500 in accordance with numbers of the Landesbank .

Rio 2016 : Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internet hit
Always the Olympians or world records do not determine the headlines with the Olympic Games .
That points the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte with the summer games to Rio de Janeiro .
In the Aquatics center swam the easily overweight float from Ethiopia so slowly that it was not to be seen occasionally no more in the TV-pictures .
It disappeared simply - no matter how was far the cutout selected .
In the social networks Habte became following the viral Internet hit .
The 24-year old with a residue of 48 seconds its advance actually terminates and occupied the 59 . Place of 59 starters .
It was however rather its not straight sporty figure , which drew the attention of the international media on itself .
Why does the 24-year old at the Olympic Games participate nevertheless ?
The Ethiopian got a right of kind of separating from the international swimming federation .
This is distributed , in order to make a swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known .
Since in Äthopien most sportsmen run , Habte wanted to make just something else .
Preparation is everything : Robel Kiros Habte makes itself finished for large running .

His time , it fastened only with one minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle , played there no role .
Comparisons with “ Eric the Eel ” were drawn likewise .
With the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric Moussambani provided for medial attention .
The appearance of the float from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable , when it had to begin in an advance over 100 meters freestyle alone .
Frenetically Moussambani was encouraged at that time .
The at that time 22-year old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and before the match never a so long distance had completed .

Here the Enforcement Trailer comes
Of Germany speeder speedometers must adjust themselves to the next generation : In different Federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash appartuses are tested , which would run over Temposünder particularly effectively are .
The futuristically working Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at points of most frequent accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
For example in motorway construction places or to reorganizing bridges with temporary speed limit there is often no necessary infrastructure , in order to provide there with a stationary Blitzer for the adherence to the speed limit .
A permanent mobile structure can be however too dangerous or complex .
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient : Its accumulator holds five days , which become drop data coded over a modem transferred with continuous measuring enterprise .
With laser measuring technique can besides all vehicles over several traces are away at the same time seized .
Variable speed limits as well as passage prohibitions after time , lane and vehicle class can be likewise supervised .
In the raised condition to move one knows the supporter according to manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling .
So that he is not simply stolen , he is lowered in the measuring enterprise , so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also bulletproof outer hull disappear .
In addition an inserted alarm installation is to protect the Blitzer against vandalism .
Since 2015 the Trailer is tested according to information by Vitronic in different Federal states and also used meanwhile .
Also foreign authorities flash with the new technology : Recently France after-ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .

He is a fantastic Ambassador for running , its enthusiasm and charisma already inspires fans for years for this kind of sport .
I said Frankie several weeks ago with Epsom that he would have gotten already 6,000 profits , if it were not only a weekend and a Großturnierjockey !

And it is not yet in the end - Dettori said formerly that he wants to continue with competitions up to its at least 50.ten year of life .

One day , after she during 6-1 a victory over Japan had shot three gates , Katie Bam made also the first two gates for the American Feldhockeyteam of the women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans with 3-0 won .
Five gates in two plays should actually represent a memorable achievement , but Bam ( 27 ) said , them can not remember to have ever done .
“ I have no idea. ” she said .
I do not belong to the people , which keep their gates in the memory .
She knows however : The Americans are about 4-0 in the olympic match and are dead even in their group with the British at the first place , who remain after their 2-0 victory against Japan unbeaten .
Great Britain and the United States will meet one another on Saturday in the last play of the first round .
Both crews qualified themselves for the quarter final , the play will already decide , which of the two will attain first and the second place in each case within their group from six teams .
The Erstplatzierte will go to the strong Dutchwomen somewhat longer out of the way , who would start the other group .
However the play on Saturday to go out likes , the Americans by their success story a surprising eddy released , four years after it with past London Games on the last of 12 places landed .
Bam was part of this team .
It buildup in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey stick in hands ( its two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel university ) , with 16 years became them national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
It missed the Olympiad in the year 2008 , since she could not itself qualify for the cadre .
Then the year 2012 came , in which for it and its team everything went wrong .
In the following year Craig Parnham , an Englishman , became coach of the national team and thus began himself the things to the better to turn .
“ A cultural change , a mental change and a physical change ” , said Bam .
We did not have the work load in London , which we have now .
We could to pull around the rudder completely .
On Thursday evening Bam opened the gate round dance in the first half of the play with a backhand stroke from close range .
India had gone without victory in the tournament into the play , but the team appeared surprisingly toughly and held the score from 1-0 into the third quarter , until Bam took the play into its hands .
It full-led a sprint with the flat ball across the left flank , pulled then into the center and lifted the ball into the gate around the Americans 2-0 a guidance to provide .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the center of the last quarter .
The Shutout was first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA , Jackie Briggs , who had in each case to book so far a gate in everyone of the previous plays .
It has a run .
Exactly the same as Bam .
“ We are in a good position ” said Parnham , but will depend as well on the result of the next play on Saturday .

Clintons and Trumps economic policy in the comparison : It 's all about the money
In infrastructure and the trade agreement invests TTP prevents - both Clinton and Trump want that .
In disagreement itself the two US president shank applicants are however with the tax and energy policy as well as in a matter of principle .
The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton a fundamental , rather philosophical difference is the basis .
That , over the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep rather small in the doubt and warns before it , like the state of the economy to harm can - with taxes and adjustments .
Clinton wants to tax and to death adjust the economy to death , says it .
It against it would completely different be , maintains Trump .
It will go back adjustments substantial , and he makes himself strong for an extensive tax revision with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for enterprises .
Clinton against it says : The state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs for it money .
Therefore the taxes for the realms were increased , say them .
Interestingly enough itself both very close with the topic infrastructure is .
Into those , nearly says Trump and Clinton must be invested .
The democratic applicant announces the largest investment into new jobs since the Second World War .
National investment programs into the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and for instance by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the republicans are strictly rejected .
To Trump thus still internal party discussions could come .
The differences are clearer in the energy and climate policy .
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and the coal promotion in the USA again for raising .
Oil production should be possible also in areas protected so far , which Paris climate protection agreements wants it to quit .
Clinton against it wants to develop the renewable energies with its investment program expressly and demands : “ A country will become the superpower of the clean energies and millions jobs will create . ”
“ It becomes probably either China , Germany or America its - I want that we are it . ”
But not only with the infrastructure - also with international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other distant .
TPP , the transpazifische trade agreement , want not to sign both .
At the same time both want to isolate however the USA not from the international trade - to separate simply only American jobs better to protect .
Those are to be also better paid then , demand for instance Clinton .
The present minimum wage of 7,25 US Dollar is a pittance .
It wants to increase it to 15 dollar per hour .
Which wants to do Trump in this question , is not completely clear : Once he says : The minimum wage must up , then it , he says may not be changed .
But the large discussion of the coming months might develop probably rather around the tax policy of the both bearings .
On the one side stands Trump , which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens , in order to set growth in motion .
Its critics reproach to it , thus became the budgetary deficit only more largely .
On the other side stands Clinton , which wants to require at least of the realms that they pay more taxes , and their critic to say : More taxes are also not the solution .

Nokia 9000 Communicator : The first smartphones
Email and Internet in slow motion : Before 20 years Nokia Communicator came on the market .
The successors dominate today the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
The equipment weighed nearly a half kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
It was thicker and larger , it lay therefore also not well in the hand .
On the contrary , it was quite chunky .
The inserted memory amounted to at the beginning of eight megabyte , which became today for approximately two Selfies with high resolution is enough .
An iPhone is delivered meanwhile with at least 16 gigabyte .
“ Nokia 9000 Communicator ” came before exactly 20 years , on 15 August 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphones .
For a few euro can lover the devices still on the Internet buy , but they originate somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
Before 20 years however the Communicator was a sensation .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product few months before on the computer fair a Cebit in Hanover as “ office in the vest pocket format ” .
Indeed , the new mobile phone knew a quantity for standards at that time : SMS and E-Mails could be sent and received , also by fax were the Communicator to be achieved .
Even that access to web pages was by HTML browsers possible , although tormenting slowly .
A pocket calculator was available , a digital directory and an electronic calendar .
There was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened unfold similarly as a laptop .
Then were a small keyboard and a monochrome screen .
The price was rather proud : 2700 D-mark , thus about 1400 euros .
The average selling price of smartphones in Germany was 2015 with 392 euros .
Nobody could suspect 1996 in August that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphones era .
Since then is everything different .
The intelligent telephones are a success story , if also not for Nokia .
The mobile phone section of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster , at Microsoft was finally sold and completed .
Today providers , who came many later all than Nokia , control the market .
Always and everywhere online its , that is today for a great many humans everyday life .
2015 gave it world-wide almost two billion smartphones users .
Were sold about 1.4 billion devices , to Samsung and Apple been allotted of it alone 555 million pieces .
The world-wide revenue with the devices is with approximately 400 billion euro .
In addition those come well current operations of the countless app providers and the telecommunications groups .
Approximately around the smartphones in the meantime a whole industry developed .
The crucial break-through to the mass-market only at the beginning of 2007 came , at that time announced Apple boss of Steve Jobs on the Mac World the introduction of the iPhone .
He promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communicator to serve everything by touch screen easily .
The triumphant advance of Apple began , this very day is the iPhone the most important product of the company .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , which controlled the market , had a checking .
They disappeared finally , to Blackberry have to fight .
Now Apple and Asian providers have a saying such as Samsung .
The smartphones are 20 years after its invention a matter of course .
On average today each German looks in the meantime 88 times a day on its mobile phone .
“ We must learn all to put away the smartphones also times ” , said straight Janina Kugel , in the Siemens executive committee responsibly for staff .
Permanent accessibility is considered meanwhile as curse and benediction at the same time .

Steel - ray of hope for German steel industry
The crisis-shaken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in million height .
Financial burdens , which threatened the industry from the green electricity promotion , are from the table .
It remains with the liberation from the renewable energy allocation with the inventory plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federals Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) to the “ West German general newspaper ” ( WAZ , Friday edition ) .
“ I am really glad over the fact that we could reach after two years of tough negotiations finally . ”
The European commission had therefore first planned , the steel manufacturers , which use gases from the blast furnace for generation of current for own consumption to ask to the cash .
The steel industry threatened according to the German branch federation additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WAZ , it gives now a principle agreement with the European Commission after discussions with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
Only if the generators in the steel plants are replaced , result an EEG allocation of 20 percent .
In addition , this is not raised in the steel industry .
The IG metal welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for own power generation .
Thus one fix to the status quo of the past regulation to a large extent .
Special meaning has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
“ Regarding our campaign 'steel is future ' is that a first step . ”
“ Further ones must follow . ”
“ Also with the reform of the emission right trade climatic and occupation goals are to weigh ” , explained IG Metal boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
The steel industry in Europe suffers since the financial crisis 2008 under over-capacities and a substantial price pressure .
Last year the situation continued to intensify , than the world largest producer country China threw domestic demand in great quantities in view of that slacking off steel on the world market .
European manufacturers accuse price dumping to Chinese steel concerns .
In the course of this spring the situation relaxed somewhat .
On the one hand imposed import duties point to import steel effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China became brighter .
Is unclear , how lasting the price recovery is .
The German top of the line Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday .
The prices would have again rather stagnated last .
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further reductions of costs .
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude thereby last also locking of individual works .
In the German steel industry at the end of 2015 approximately 86000 humans was busy .
In July the German steel manufacturers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders .
They produced well six percent less rawsteel than in with 3.4 million tons the previous year month , as the trade association communicated steel on Friday .
After a short increase in May the manufactured quantity decreased now the second month one behind the other .
Since beginning of the year production is by two percent under the previous year 's value .
The federation counts in the coming months owing to an improved situation concerning orders on a rising output .

Partition Callum Skinner storms home , when a Britisher achieves gold for cycling
Scotland Callum Skinner rests last evening in the man team sprint in the velodrome in Rio to the fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
The 23-year old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which its compatriot sir Chris Hoy had made itself own . The Jungspund made the legend proud , when it stormed home , in order to rake a victory of the favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a shocking victory before four years , while Hoy got the fifth of six olympia gold medals .
They repeated the trick , after they got a modest sixth place in March with the course world championships in London despite the resignation Hoys only .
The problem between Peking and London was the replacement of the Anfahrers Jamie Staff .
They did this in time as Hindes emerged .
Hoys retirement produced a gap , Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man , with whom they remained , when they saw potential in the Scot , which now unfolded .
Hindes , Kenny - which triumphed before four years with Hoy - and Skinner set an olympia record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders in the first round triumphed .
And the British trio won the duel also gold .
Hindes was past after its round scarcely , but Kenny brought forward the team and to Skinner held it .
A change of strategy constituted a large part of the transformation , with which Hindes drove in a higher course to hold in order to slow it down and to make it possible Kenny and above all Skinner , the speed .
Hoy watched of its position as an BBC expert out and was noticeable to Skinner , Kenny and Hindes , when these rose to the landing .
The 23-year old Skinner from Glasgow said : “ It is a flattering comparison . ”
I am only here , in order to do and for me a name make my best .
We set up an olympia record in the final round and defeated the world champions .
It was simply unbelievable .
There is no better kind this to win .
After Triumph 2012 at the page Kennys and Hoys admitted Hindes that he fell after a weak start intentionally on the course .
He did not withdraw this statement later and it came an objection of England rivals .
With so an outstanding victory there was this time none such problem .
Hindes said : “ It feels with the whole GB of flags on the grandstand such as London . ”
We met in the last three months as a team .
We got away with so many world titles so badly that it was unbelievable to win again with the Olympiad .
That is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which seven were won by 10 titles both in Peking and in London .
If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months that expect us successful five days in the velodrome .
With the form Kennys is it in the range of the possible one that he repeats Hoys victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition .
That became for Kenny - which is 12 years younger exactly than Hoy , likewise to 23 . March was born ( an apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal to mean .
That would equal from Hoy .
Kenny participates next in the sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
The 28-year old from Bolton said : “ I enjoy this only for the moment . ”
The team event is always best .
One can win it with its colleagues .
It feels somewhat lonely to win alone .
Hindes said : “ If it two further gold medals wins , should be struck it to the knight . ”
It was the only medal competition of the day , but there was further good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , OD Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified themselves with the fastest achievement in the quadripartite four-kilometer running .
They arrived at 3:51,942 at the goal .
The world record , which won 2012 in London gold , was with 3:51,659 .
The first and final round ( 22.42 ) take place today on the second day of the Wettbewers , with which Wiggins with security will stand in the focus .
It had argued yesterday with assigned one before the qualification , when functionaries called it to itself , in order to measure its body size .
In the appropriate woman competition , which is continued tomorrow and terminated , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald OF Milngavie in world record time was promoted in 4:13,260 .
The GB team relies on its strong course wheel team , in order to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd at medals .
After a indeed unusual representation of absolute dominance in Peking and London expectations for Rio were driven down .
Drama in the background , as the resignation of the technical manager Shane Sutton in April in the midst of from sexism and bullying reproaches as well as the retirement took place from sizes as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
If one views oneself however the first evening of the competition in the velodrome , it looks whole like it , as if the legendary call GBs , which reached its high point to the perfect moment , could be repeated again .

Destination plates : who actually buys records ?
Lonely men of middle age love plates .
Before you rush to the comment part , in order to scatter it under the alias NichtAlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters with rough offenses , this statement is derived from current data .
According to YouGov the much-discussed rerising of records is on one does not boom in Millennials , which want to welcome the news of physical articles to attribute but to Midlife nostalgia .
Those , which bought recently a plate , are in all probability in the age between 45 and 54 .
Indeed the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable buyer category .
It is also no hordes through hobby collecting tanks - it has an emotional meaning : older disk buyers keep their feelings rather for itself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
But the results of YouGov are correct ?
If these blogs a news report on TV were , the camera would follow me , while I run in the midst of a busy road in Soho , a modest grey suit carries and wildly gestuliere , before I stop , my hands to hold and something determining said how : “ Thus , you let a closer look on it throw us . ”
Thus , you let a view of it throw us .
Even if the heart Sohos loses slowly at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill now the buildings , in which once independent salespersen resided - still gives it a handful of fantastic disk special firms .
I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera off for the next part in which I am located and tried in direct proximity to different men in such business to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , which I of Sister Ray ( data 's number : two young women , three men of middle age ) in the Reckless record ( data 's number : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably in order the 20 ) follow , is long one day because of a meeting into London and goes through the business , in order to fill those few hours .
Is it a collecting tank , asks I ?
“ I estimate already , ” say he .
I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
These records , above shown ( it sent the snapshot to me by email , did not follow I it home ) , line the walls of its living room .
The reason , why it possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he now is able to buy plates which it could not afford to buy as it published and again articles which it sold , when it was young and broke .
“ Many things , which I buy , are from the late 60ern , early 70ern , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . ” He says things , with which I was too young probably somewhat , in order to buy her to me .
It agrees that and it adds those , which buy plates , rather introverted are and gladly alone time spend : “ I do not smoke and I drink not very much .
That is my vice .
Wez , 25 , which works at Sister Ray , believes also that many customers , whom it meets apply to the YouGov profile .
He noticed however also a new wave at people , which are affected by the Medienhpe , people , which heard over the comeback and itself arranges to see to buy again their old plates .
From the discussions , which I led , people got rid of their collection usually in such a way around 1998 or 1999 .
Customers , who sold once their plates , in order to buy CDs , sell now their CDs , in order to buy again their plates , ” say it .
That will boom at supporters of the disk revival of a certain age to explain .
But which is with the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
It takes only some seconds in a business such as Phonica , in order to recognize that a reassuring community of like-minded ones offers disk business .
According to Wez took some the older customers impact at the contactless payment system .
Some disk fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw itself to stability from familiar record coverings , from articles , which evoke happy youthful memories .
“ I think , sometimes can it filling an emptiness or the possession of material properties as a kind comfort be , ” say Wez .
That is with me as collecting tank like that and I thinks that it is at many people like that .
It is a simple way to be occupied mentally .
“ We are like their social workers ! ” an employee from a disk pack pipes .
A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people , which bought last month a plate did not belong it yet .
The survey also found out the fact that 41 % possess a record player , which they never use , while 7 % those , which buy a plate , does not possess a record player .
At this time the news report I to look probably very anxious , while I leaf by a pile at Bossa new facts compilations .
Jonny , 42 , that with sounds OF the university Universities of ( data 's number : three men of middle age ) , “ aspect of trophy ” of the revival works noticed .
“ Someone came in only recently here and said : “ I do not possess a record player , but I would buy gladly a Radiohead record , so that I can place her in the shelf , ” say he .
This is not a large percentage , but it happens definitely .
More produktlastig , less musiklastig .
We have people , which say : “ I do not have a record player . ”
Those are younger people , not older , which come in only slowly .
Tease , which dedicated nearly a whole floor to the records , a more multicolored audience has , than I go in .
It gives pairs around the 70 , tourists , who make photos , tea-gnaw-young and to women of middle age .
Even if the atmosphere roars somewhat less relaxed than into that to business managing specified actual game Beasts of more newly synthesizer and sexbepackter Pop in place of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it to see is good , such a diversity at the customers .
None of them looks particularly lonely , but gnawing psychological traumata can be recognized with difficulty , if one stands beside someone 30 seconds long .
Elanora , 27 , runs around for some minutes in the business and regards the variety of the plates standing to the sale .
It makes rather one shop window-strolls as a bulk buying .
She does not earn much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , says it .
It costs much .
It is to be heard easily music by a computer or on other way , but the beauty of plates is… ” it drives off with a sigh fallen in love .
I do not know , as I it to explain am - it is really singular .
My last stop is a business , by which it is said that a new generation of disk lovers is to have inspired : Urban Outfitters .
While I give the appearance to examine the jeans hot pant I observe a group of young tea gnawing girls , who group themselves for one moment around Polaroid cameras , before a father and its daughter consider themselves , a Crosley record players to buy .
To linking is a stairway , a wall of full plates of ennobles , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classical authors , the essential plates for an average collection .
Nobody sees itself it to on perhaps , because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch her .
It is pure “ disk art ” .
But considering its that for the industry it means each attraction for these articles more funds and into the depths Sohos for more fancy would know some customers , it does not give it to anything , in order to weight .
It is not a surprise that a subpopulation , which has more time and money than others is also that , which spends at most on luxury articles such as plates .
Even if my investigations showed that results of YouGov are correct , leave it , at least in disk business in Soho , which large number of female collectors and disk lovers , which exist in the reality , disk business and in online forums , unconsidered .
These humans work probably hard at school or in offices .
They do not spend their Thursday tomorrow with security with strolling by disk business of Berwick Street and leafing by plates , while they avoid the staring view uncanny , 30-year old wrong moderator , which rises over the shoulders nothing suspecting men of middle age .

Pokémon Go , a hunt for health and luck , which are worthwhile themselves
It is to be watched fascinatingly , how the world changes .
The fact that teenagers and child do not go to no more to playing to outside was deplored but it rather to prefer to spend their spare time thereby at screens to stare , in the last decade by many .
With Pokemon Go goes it around getting and become more active letting people from the sofa to .
The time at the screen was at first limited to the television , then to video games and last to smartphones .
From there it is to be seen greatly that technology and activities in the free one are not mutually exclusive .
I refer thereby naturally to the Pokémon Go-illusion , an app , which is based on the characters , those first for the video games into the 1990ern to create ( later developed from it an indication trick series , playing cards and other spin Offs ) .
Like many phenomena of the popular culture the interest before the publication of the play sank in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July somewhat .
The introduction on the market in other countries was shifted by the substantial demand , which overloaded the servers .
Within a few days Pokémon Go of more users than Tinder and nearly so many had like Twitter .
How does it function ?
Briefly said the players with their smartphones go looking for outside and for Pokémons , which are after-pursued with a GPS and , as soon as they were once found , “ photographed ” ( over a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or to become “ imprisoned taken ” to be able .
A generation , which played the play , when it was still younger , followed the illusion and jumped for the search of the sofa .
In the USA the play led to a considerable rise at steps , which the “ average ” person puts back each day .
Cardiogram , app for Apple Watch , which after-pursues 35,000 users , communicated Washington Post recently that within two days after introduction on the market of the play , which started number of of the after-pursued people , which train each day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
The enterprise does not know , who plays of it Pokémon Go - it sees only the raw data for increase in output .
Many public clearing-up campaigns to the health , the people to it to bring want “ 30 minutes time to take themselves , ” “ from the sofa to come ” and “ each day be active ” discovered deaf ears , because many public messages are boring to the health and come from people , which look miserable .
Nevertheless the meaning of sport can not be overestimated .
Who drives regularly sport , reduces its opportunities to get sick with cancer or depressions .
Physical manipulation helps with weight control to state high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list at advantages , which too long are , in order it here .
But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings the people to do something in the free one that them joke makes .
Thus three columns of the health are taken off - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as joke .
Some people close even new friendships on the hunt .
As there are always also grumpy spoilsports , who must always weight about something .
And yes , someone could run against a door .
What is it ?
A break-through occurred .
Even if smartphones apps could after-pursue such as fit bits already in former times our activity , they did not give us a reason to drift sport as it does this play .
The new will lose its attraction and will leave the use with the time .
Due to Pokemons success will give it however more plays , which will unite apps and virtual reality with in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , more actively , to be more fitter and healthier .

Restful night : Hint against sleep disturbances

Which one understands popularly by it , are however the Insomnie , thus an in and a Durchschlafstörung .
Many humans feel straight sleeping through as unsatisfactory or say insufficient , Jens Wagenknecht , Vorstandsmitglied in the German family doctor federation with practice in the Varel of Lower Saxony .
What is behind sleep disturbances ?
The causes of sleep disturbances are complex .
Behind it organic , psychological or behavior-conditioned factors , in addition , medicines can put .
Pretty often the sleep disturbance is expression of another illness .
“ Very early waking up is particularly frequent with a depression ” , says Weeß .
And it can be that different factors cause each other .
Who has for example a herniated disc , can lie badly , wakes up all two to three hours and possibly begins , over everyday problems and - to brood , give Weeß ensure an example .
That leads to strain , and sleep is not possible any longer .
Starting from when should one with sleep disturbances to the physician ?
Who sleeps during one period of one month at least three nights per week not well and is impaired on the day , Weeß should go to the physician , guesses/advises .
The impairment can look completely different : One is reduced , tired , unausgeschlafen , has difficulties with the attention and the concentration , is easily attractionable , has changes in mood or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
In order to alleviate the sleep disturbance , is important it to find their causes out .
As treatment options are applicable among other things changes of behavior , a cognitive behavior therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping pills only in the exceptional case and at the most for two weeks - .
The established sleep medical profession it hardly gives , stresses Leiter of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical center of the Charité university University of Berlin in Germany Professor Ingo Fietze .
Therefore one should turn for sleep problems first to the family doctor , guesses themselves Weeß .
That can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
Who should in the sleep laboratory , and which happens there ?
To the investigation in the sleep laboratory the medical profession guess/advise for example when snoring with breath dropouts , with diseased daily tiredness , with sleep-walkers or if one does not find the cause of a Durchschlafstörung , Fietze explains .
For the investigation to prepare one does not have itself actually .
One should spend the day normally .
“ Only please ” Fietze make , say no midday sleep .
To wiring one goes to its normal time to bed .
Beside the electrodes at the body one carries nose glasses , a chest belt and a feeler at the finger .
Besides a camera at the cover notes to the sleeping .
How can concerning the problems get into the grasp ?
There are rather many set screws , at which one can set for a better sleep .
Weeß enumerates : Regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed are , because of the day do not sleep , do not watch television for falling asleep , alcohol avoid and on the clock do not look at night - then one begins to count immediately , and that is not favorable at all .

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is new refugee-assigned
Annika Deuschle is the partner in things integration and organizer .
In addition it is social female worker locally .
Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee-assigned for Urbach .
The social teacher supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger .
She sees herself as a partner for all participants : Refugees , working group refugee work , administration , authorities and who otherwise still mixes together .
Regine Kunde of the working group suggests that the honorary ones are than grateful more that Deuschle is now there , the egg-laying woolly milch sow , which has above all a problem .
Thus some - less scoffing than rather on the variety on desire fields of application aiming at - had meant , when the administration wanted to write the place out .
An administration employee was looked for with a talent for languages and humans , connected with an experience of many years within the range of the social work , just an egg-laying woolly milch sow .
But clerical work is not their central range , means Annika Deuschle .
Above all go it around organization , work with humans locally and also behind the scenes as well as to network activity .
The 31-year old participates for approximately six weeks .
It limited a 50-Prozent-Stelle on three years .
“ It was high time ” , says Regine Kunde that Annika Deuschle supports honoured and full-time participants .
There are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
Soon new containers are located in the which road
A serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees who were recognized .
For the connection accommodation the municipalities are responsible .
They must accommodate the refugees in own or rented dwellings .
The costs of the building , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves .
The responsibility changes from the district administration office on municipality and job centre .
Problem : There are free objects , but not each landlord wants to offer its apartment .
The search turns out for some time as very difficult .
De facto the administration does not find private apartments .
It does not function so far , one is dependent on private dwellings , like that Deuschle .
Therefore gemeindliche apartments must be trained , as it is called so beautiful .
Thus soon new containers in the which road are set up .
But only with apartments it is not done .
Perspective is the keyword , is itself Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle united .
Beside a firm lodging there is internship places , apprentice positions , school places , one-euro-jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and Migranten , who gefundnen or must be furnished .
“ Would be good more places ” , reports Regine Kunde .
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers , settle non-profit work - and motivates and very properly , as Annika Deuschle reports .
She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
That is not “ occupation therapy ” .
Activity does not however only mean work .
The day needs a firm structure , says Deuschle and customer .
Humans would have to develop a sense of belonging .
Thus need it offers such as sport , contacts with native ones and above all language courses .
Professional courses are RSR .
Thus administration and honorary ones substitute also here .
It is central vision that the refugees get the feeling , it is desired and welcome in Germany .
The long duration of the procedures is a problem .
They must explain to the refugees that it lasts just and it meaningfully can bridge the time , for example with language courses .
Who develops the feeling sometime , he can in Urbach nobody help , may not work and is useless , which will never integrate itself .
The clear majority is motivated .
There are cases of problem in addition , say , customer honestly , “ people , at which nothing at all does not go ” . The work of Deuschle and customer are always also to motivate others .
All this is already a “ giant task ” .
A difficult question : Do the two have fear of radicalization after the recent occurrences , also in a small community such as Urbach ?
“ No ” , Regine Kunde says completely clearly , “ which some naively call may ” . A residual risk can not exclude and does not want it however .
Sensitized however already are the aides .
These incidents are also topic with the refugees .
Those would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely in disrepute .
“ You want to show that they have to do thereby nothing ” , say Regine Kunde .
Many would remain gladly in Urbach .
Thus head and honorary ones must hold locally and in the region after activities look out .
They have always in the background that soon a new impact at refugees and Migranten could come to Urbach .
Does Germany need an upper limit ?
This question clearly to answer , is afraid the policy .
Actually it is unfair to place it to aides locally .
“ In Urbach we arrived not yet , where we would like ” , say Annika Deuschle .
No new refugees , which would ease the situation .
Regine Kunde makes likewise clear that the Urbacher is working at full capacity already to integrate past humans reasonably .
Those are at present approximately 100 people , predominantly young men .
But if humans are in emergency , one must help them , is itself both women united .
The political international situation is not so complicated , there gives it simple answers .

Escape : “ Each fled woman has experiences by sexual force ”
Sexual force belongs for women , who flee alone , nearly already to the everyday life .
If they arrive at Germany , they are often traumatized .
A house offers refuge .
In a large kitchen four women sit .
Everyone has a baby , who is old at the most one year .
One put its small son into the arm .
It looks with large eyes curiously into the area .
Its mother stares at the desk top .
Until it notices that she is observed .
It smiles briefly and kisses the small one .
The scene works normally .
Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr .
She is a range range from Condrobs , a carrier for social offers of help in Bavaria , and concerns herself among other things with the topic women on the escape .
The four women in the kitchen are fleeing .
They live in Munich the north in one of the few decentralized accommodation for alone-fled women and their children in Bavaria .
In January Condrobs opened the facility as well as pro Familia and that Munich for women 's aid organisation .
Recently it was officially opened .
There 60 people live - about 40 women and 20 children .
There are men none - also not as a visitor .
The exception is a guard before the door .
“ It is not to be said exaggerated : Each woman , who arrives here , made , says experiences by sexual force on her escape ” Bahr .
“ Men flee because of wars , because they are politically pursued , because torture or death threatens them or because they send , tell their families as hopes to Europe ” them .
With women other reasons for the escape outweigh : “ Many steal themselves secretly of it because they do not see other way out ” .
In their homeland they made for experience with sexual force , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
That chases away it .
On the escape that continues .
“ That tractors demand for example for a bottle of water a sexual action , are no rarity ” , say Bahr .
And the women are alone , them not by their families are protected .
Who believes that end , as soon as they would arrive at Germany , err , tell Bahr .
Single women in refugee accommodation were often regarded also here as inferior and abused at worst .
That leads to it that about 90 percent of the women , who live in the accommodation in Munich the north it is traumatized , estimates it .
“ Did not develop surely some the children voluntarily ” .
Many women are so used to it that they do not say anything .
“ Or they dare not to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too large ” .
Since they would often not know to help itself , need it more accommodation only for them , demand Bahr .
In Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
To the question , whether they would know from a similar project as in Munich in their scope of responsibility , it answers some with no .
In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia about there is not something like that in accommodation of the governments .
Also in Swabians alone fled women are accommodated separately , say Karl-Heinz Meyer , Pressesprecher of the government .
In Upper Bavaria , under and middle Franconia there are floors or own houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children .
The exception is Lower Bavaria , there gives it to two central of accommodation exclusive for women .
Also the committee of “ rights of the woman and equality of the sexes ” in the European parliament demands that women must be accommodated separately from men .
In a study , which was published for the committee , it means : “ It is very important that men and women are separately accommodated . ”
“ The privacy is missing or men and women is together accommodated , can it continually - force against women come ” .
Above all the wash rooms should be easily accessible separately and for women , stand in the study .
The how very women feel this protection need , one can read off from the crush , which there is on the house in Munich .
“ Since itself got around that there are us , have we a long waiting list ” , says Bahr .
One could open easily a second house .

Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania : “ There goes , where it hurts ”
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania : The native ones do not receive anything from the summer election campaign - and the holiday-makers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not select the federal state parliament .
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they understood .
2021 already did not decide the election of the federal parliament again directly in the end summer holidays to take place , the Schweriner parliament at the beginning of the year .
Because dumber than so far it does not go : Summer holidays , heat and election campaign for the Landtag - bites itself .
The native ones , which are to be convinced by the election campaigners , are on vacation .
The most holiday-makers , who are in the country , on Usedom , reproaches or Hiddensee on the way , are not native ones , may thus not the federal state parliament select .
In addition practical problems come : In holidays aides , that hang posters up , are ballons blow up , flyers distribute and in the end voting count out to find only laboriously .
By 4 September 2016 , choice and last holidays day , Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania must let past be issued once still election campaign scarcely at the people over itself .
The hot phase , if one can say that at all , began straight .
And it concerns also somewhat : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , Anführer of a SPD/CDU coalition , must be afraid for his office .
The SPD , since 1998 a strongest party , lies now in surveys clearly behind the CDU .
Becomes exciting , as strongly beginner AfD cuts off and which in the end coalition-suited remains remaining .
Sellering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes a nearly inconspicuously working election campaign , sieved one from its large posters .
It travels by the country , distributes roses and plauscht a little with the people , as it already his legendarily word-meager predecessor Harald Ringstorff did .
Otherwise soul ring got and gives cold feet chancellor Merkel the debt at blooming the AfD .
Their refugee politics , it “ we create ” the ascent of the right populists accelerated , which will probably cost it now the beautiful office .
The CDU with their leading candidate , who Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier , has already experienced , how it is , if one makes election campaign the wrong time at the correct place .
It invited twice chancellor Angela Merkel to large demonstrations ; Merkel election to the Bundestag circle lies in the northeast .
But the target audience did not tune , it was more Norths Rhine-Westphalia , citizen of Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburger and West Pomerania .
“ There the majority from other Federal states ” was probable , complained Vincent Kokert , Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , recently in the NDR .
But it harms also nobody from other corners of Germany to listen once to Angela Merkel .
Otherwise the northeast CDU does to a large extent without the usual election campaign conditions on market places and before shopping centres with parasols and ballons .
That , then means Kokert , plays only a “ subordinated role ” .
Also the union noticed that you wegbröselt on the country the basis that it must exert much to find again a wire to the people .
You go it like that to linking , the SPD , the Green : in the widths of the country hardly available .
The advice of the CDU election campaigner Kokert to its fellow combatants is however also exposing : “ You must go there , where it hurts , i.e . where humans are : Village festivals , golden weddings , each birthday party must be used ” .
Because much stands on the play , Sellering called its SPD now to a particularly engaged election campaign .
In surveys the Social Democrats lay last with 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and only scarcely before the AfD ( 19 ) .
With the choice 2011 the SPD had won still clearly with 35,6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
The Greens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , might create the leap into the federal state parliament .
They make a modern virtue from the holidays emergency and move their election campaign mostly in the Internet .
“ Online election campaign ” , calls it the regional chairmen Claudia Müller .
Otherwise go green election campaigners on tracing after native voting citizens among the holiday-makers .
Silke Gajek , the leading candidate , circles straight with a houseboat by the Mecklenburgian seas and finds it also still beautiful .
Their impression : “ Choice vacation in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment ” .

Strike it then with the knee into the ledge and rotate you , while the aggressor before pain together-curves , the weapon from its hands . Strike it with the run in the face and move you backwards , while they direct the weapon toward it .
With aggressors , that approach from the front , the technology is similar - move your body from the line of fire , seize you the weapon and rotate you them , so that the aggressor can not shoot .

In the midst of rise up the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Trampolins
Where always you are also , as late it is also , there is the Olympic Games .
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steadily and inevitably , a racing relay race between competition and props .
It is , as if the olympic torch would be a burning staff , that is handed of crossbow contactors to the float to the gymnast to the triathlete .
They can not switch the television on , read a newspaper or listen with the discussion of your neighbour in the queue in the Coffeshop , without hearing over Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the controversy between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
And then it gives still Logan Dooley .
Dooley , which is for the first time with the Olympic Games thereby and a woman swarm with dimples , could have been quite under this well-known names , which are sent to the Prime time , developed by sponsors and Wohlfühl TV advertisement , if he were a float , a gymnast or even a fencer .
But Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the olympic Trampolinturnen for gold .
The olympic flame does not light up each equal event .
Of the center , partly in the shade continue to be the kinds of sport , which are not generally appreciative : Airgun-shoot , sheet shooting , bath min tone , taekwondo .
We will always have and may the breaststroke swimming it for a long time prevail .
But if I modest-prove arguments for my certain favourite to make were allowed , then you let me steer the attention on the discrete charm of the Trampolins .
Although the Trampolinspringen is already since 2000 an olympic event , when it had its debut in Sydney , it the last 16 years so meagerly noticed that those , I had asked many , did not know that it is at all an olympia kind of sport .
That could be also regional ignorance .
Although the USA to the match sent athletes , it won never a medal in the Trampolinspringen and had to 2012 an athlete , which created it up to the final round .
The Chinese and the Russians bend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend this year their gold medal from London .
The Trampolinspringen has a certain outsider charm , partly because it for the unexplained ear more suitably for a clown school than for the Olympic Games sounds .
Here I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a ground-based enthusiast .
It has humoristic potential - kartoonhafte trembling of its to never end wanting impact - in addition , the grace of doing gymnastics and dipping , the two kinds of sport , which it essentially unites .
The word “ Trampolin ” comes from the Spanish El Trampolin , which means so much like “ springboard . ”
Rising winners jump on a gigantic Trampolin , shoot nearly up to 30 foot into air and must a row at falling movements ( tricks , pikes and somersaults ) , before they land on the feet .
They are evaluated according to official olympia program after execution , degree of difficulty and “ flying time ” .
Zweiundreißig athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will begin against each other in Rio .
The in accordance with-loneliest olympic vector is straightforward .
Medal-hoping must go in their striving for gold further , faster , upward and over it , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and forth , upward and downward on the playground .
They hunt not only the target line or the output wall , but in the television transmission also a further scornful goal : those the world or the olympia record .
Purposeful striving is noble , admirable , even fanatical - and it is enough , in order to agitate even a spectator to tears .
But it is also what I feel when watching these plays as something fatiguing .
Of it the Trampolin offers a breathing space .
The vector of the Trampolinspringers is above .
A forward movement is not the goal .
It or it reflects , apparently weightlessly like an astronaut , goes upward , then downward , then easy again upward .
A competition , naturally not without difficulty , prevails also here but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no curving to the distance , only the dreamy , elegant abolition of time and gravity .
It is like that Zen like the competition with the Olympic Games to only be can .
The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming around 13.00 Eastern time ; those of the men on Saturday , likewise around 13.00 .
NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting from 14.00 .
In the midst of the olympia mania they promise a calm , nice moment , one , which will probably ignore generally tumult .
If the consciousness increase can be achieved only by gaping and the Objektifizierung of male athletes - how the male US-gymnasts suggested it according to the The Wall Street Journal recently - then its , new fan club struggling for air expects Mr. Dooley .

Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for daily use
Into the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything : little SUV , little coupé and also still the versatility of a minivan .
Sounds rather overloaded , but the HR-V , which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves in the everyday life as expressed flexible .
Although only the 1.60 m work high HR-V rather small , the passengers have both in the front row and in the fund much place , works nowhere closely .
The materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasantly , only the cockpit top side drop there somewhat .
More versatile than comparable vehicles the HR-V is with the reservoir .
A trunk is not only available highranking and 1026 l of 453 l at with turned down backrests , but there are the “ Magic Seat ” .
That is less magic , than it sounds : The seat faces of the back bank can be lifted up and offered like cinema armchairs thereby reservoir , which is high from the ground to covering 1.24 m .
The trunk can be loaded well , however loading height with 650 mm is somewhat higher than with comparable Peugeot 2008 .
The tested 1,6-l-Diesel with 88 kW/120 HP accelerates the HR-V owing to the torque of up to 300 Nm in far speed ranges very strong .
He might perform its work however somewhat more quietly .
The everyday life consumption of 4,7 l/100 km is pleasing .
There is still another further motorization : a 1,5-l-Benziner with 96 kW/130 HP .
An all-wheel drive is not offered .
The handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
The steering element might be somewhat more direct however .
The equipment does not leave desires open in the tested Top variant “ Executive ” .
To the safety systems belong the town center emergency brake assistant ( works to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the trace retaining assistant .
The Kollisionswarner irritates sometimes , because it evaluates many obstacles when ranking as “ approaching objects ” .
The high beam assistant works very reliably .
And the intelligent speed controller reacted to the road sign recognition and throttles if necessary the speed .
Full connectivity gives it however only for the Top equipment : 7-Zoll-Touchscreen , Navi , app integration and more .
Two USB and a HDMI socket are under the arm rest and are somewhat pedantic therefore to reach .
Those approximately 29000 euros for the well equipped Top Diesel are correct .
Who does not want to invest so much , receives the gasoline-driven car starting from 20000 euros , the Diesel starting from 23000 euros .
The engines fulfill the Euro-6-Abgasnorm .
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and suitable for daily use car .

Adblock plus , Facebook in “ Katz-und mouse play ” concerning indicator blocking
For enterprises , those with online advertisement money earn equal according to one the software vendor attempts to go around indicator blocking “ Katz and a mouse play ” .
On Thursday , only two days after to Facebook that it would block indicator blockings on its desktop side , published Adblock plus announced a blog post office , in which it communicated that users could update their filters in the program , in order to block advertisement in the social network again .
On Tuesday Facebook communicated that its desktop side would change the encoding concerning its adverts , in order it to indicator blockings the recognition over it , which part of the side advertisement is , to make more difficult to recognize .
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to go around the new codes .
In a blog post office the spokesman of Adblock Ben William that “ this kind is already and ago fight between indicate-blocking Open Source Community and the Umgehern since the invention of indicator blockers under way , wrote ” and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
The fact that the world largest enterprise for social media admitted itself into the fight , is a strong indication for it how causing concern indicator blockers for the industry became .
World-wide approximately 200 million people use indicator blockers according to a study of the last year of PAGE fair and Adobe ; nearly four times so much 2013 .
With 1.03 billion daily active users , who access Facebook over their mobile terminals , mobile phone advertisement constitutes 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Facebook .
The enterprise has it on indicator blockers on desktop PC foreseen , since mobile indicator blockers do not have effect on of Facebook mobile app for the social network and Instagram , communicated a spokesman .
Advertisement on desktop PC constitutes a sufficient large portion of the incomes , so that Facebook appears the investment of such a step as be worth worth .
On Tuesday Facebook communicated that it would update its “ indicator preference tools ” , in order to have the people more control over on it advertisement aimed at .
On Thursday Facebook stated that Adblocks would be causing concern new filters , because they would block also contents on the side , which is not advertisement .
“ For the users no positive experience represents , from there plans we to address the problem ” communicated a spokesman of Facebook in a report of email .
Indicator blockers are a blunt means , why we us instead on developer tools such as Ad Preferences concentrated , in order to put more control into the hands of the people .

The right “ Identitäre movement ” is in its sights the federal office for protection of the constitution guessed/advised .
After several offices of a federal state also the Verfassungsschützer in the federation placed the group under observation .
“ We see reference points for efforts with the 'Identitären movement ' against the liberal democratic constitutional structure ” , said protection of the constitution boss of Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German press agency in Berlin .
Thus immigrants of Islamic faith are defamed or from the Near East in extremist way .
Therefore we observe the movement now also .
The “ Identitäre movement ” is a grouping with French roots , which is active since 2012 also in Germany .
It turns against “ Multikulti illusion ” , “ uncontrolled mass immigration ” and the “ loss of the own identity by foreign infiltration ” .
Verfassungsschützer in nine Federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden-Wuerttemberg , North-Rhine/Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the “ Identitären ” already .
Maaßen said , its authority with the decision with the offices of a federal state had closely come to an agreement .
“ Groups like the 'Identitäre movement ' try to fetch their target audience where it stands , said ” the protection of the constitution boss .
Extremists generally try to address it with youth-fair language often with trendy music .
Islamists would do that just like right-wing extremists .
That is not fussy advertisement for the own thing .
Propaganda is to address the people emotional .
Young people are there in special way susceptible .
That is dangerous .
It had last given reports from several Federal states over contacts of the “ Identitären ” to AfD politicians .
Maaßen said , in addition he did not have realizations .
For the protection of the constitution possible contacts of this kind are only relevant starting from a certain point .
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people , who are extremist , change their objective and become so extremist .
Decisive it is thus whether such people have steering influence on the party .
This is not recognizable .
With view of the clear increase of right-motivated criminal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation Maaßen , it said in this context not yet again to right terrorism would speak .
But we stated in the past years that there can be rechtsterroristische structures .
There was the group 'old School Society ' or the Freitaler group .
It can quite be that further rechtsterroristische groupings or Kleinstgruppen form , which plan attacks against asylum-seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right-extremist motives .
A Germany-wide or European-wide control of right terrorism is however not recognizable .
The past groups developed on the regional level or in social nets .
Procured Maaßen expressed itself over the fact that many encroachments went on the account from humans , who had not stepped before in the right scene into feature .
That is the causing concern .
Many the suspects with attacks on asylum accommodation are before not as criminal ones , politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene do not admit been .
“ Many people committed thus criminal offences , which did not have nothing at all before with right-wing extremists at the hat , who were perhaps politically indifferent or for example CDU , SPD or link to have selected , which tendency-makes itself then however by right-extremist radicalized ” .

The Raiffeisen bank Gmund at the Tegernsee required of rich savers in the future penalty interest - as second Institut in Germany .
Bank boss Josef Paul said on Thursday : “ It concerns only 139 customers , who park 40 million euros on giro or call money accounts ” .
The Federal association of German banks speaks of an individual case and sees therein no signal : Normal savers would not have “ to fear , for their savings groschens penalty rate to pay ” .
Over night with the European central bank ( EZB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent of penalty rate to camps banks money .
This fee requires the Raiffeisen bank Gmund starting from September von Privat- and Firmenkunden for inserts over 100,000 euros on giro or call money accounts back .
“ The first 100,000 euros are free . ”
“ The next 100,000 costs in the future 400 euros in the year ” , said Paul .
He guard for quite some time 40 million euros , which could be taken off from one day on the others and which it could not use .
“ Costs ” are , said the bank boss with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent .
“ I can not put for each million 4000 euros down . ”
Pass the costs on it after the causer pays principle now .
The cash simply in the safe deposits of the Raiffeisen bank lie to let , would be much too dangerous : “ I experienced already four assaults , I would not like still fifth ! ” , the bank executive committee said .
Most customers would have understanding and changed on other investment vehicles .
Only few moved away to other banks .
The cooperative federation Bavaria explained : “ The extreme monetary political course of the EZB causes substantial costs ” with all banks .
It alone to carry , is “ economically permanently not possible ” .
Some German banks increased therefore their fees for account processing , credit cards or transfers .
With penalty interest for inserts starting from three million euros the Thuringians people and Raiffeisen bank Altenburger country with their skat branch bank 2014 headlines had made .
Michael Kemmer , Hauptgeschäftsführer of the bank federation , said : “ We do not expect that private customers surface covering repay for inserts pay must , in addition are much too strong the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks ” .
A banker said , at the Tegernsee gives it “ a clientele , which is somewhat more sumptuously equipped by the fortune ” .
“ That can become for a small bank the problem ” , if she guards money free of charge .
The 1911 created loan bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach Egern , Kreuth and Tegernsee .
In the region live well-known actors , sportsman and entrepreneur .
The cooperative federation Bavaria “ at present no further banks are well-known , which compute , said a display replacement for inserts of private customers ” spokesman Ernst .
The president of the Federal association of the German people banks and Raiffeisen banks ( BVR ) , Uwe merry , had explained at the end of June : “ The threshold , into negatives to go opposite the private customer , is very , very high ” .
The competition is hard , and the drift from investors threatens to the competition .
The customers in Germany will not leave themselves fallen in the width .

Snapchat of “ anime ” - effect as Asian caricature criticizes
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired , but some observers say that it is insensitive in relation to races .
With its filter tools it makes Snapchat approximately 150 million for daily users possible to change and play with identities in so a way the reality , which already borders on the absurd .
They can transform into a pineapple , a dog or a figure , which could be from a Roy Lichtenstein 's paintings .
The filters are blunt , characteristic-rotating tools , which produce more than 30 million improved Selfies per day .
All lapses arrive at the public .
Snapchat filters pulled in the past criticism on itself , in which they were accused of the fact that the app promotes Blackface or as ideal of beauty would publicise white skin .
When it suggested this week to some users a filter , which gave slot eyes , wrong teeth and aufgedunsene cheeks them , it some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - “ yellow face ” .
They asked themselves whether these repetitive controversies referred to a larger problem that the enterprise with diversity has .
The news and the indignation were spread on Wednesday far , with reports of The Verge and motherboard , one day after Snapchat communicated that it would have deactivated the feature .
The enterprise offered an apology : The filter was meant as homage of anime characters and not as caricature from Asians .
But outsider , the racing SiS mash experienced , reminded the filter of injuring plates .
Others leaned the anime comparison decided off .
In an email wrote Grace Sparapani , an Korean-American art student , whose Tweet was far spread over the photos that the filter was said unpleasant “ injuring and gentle . ”
It added that “ it was difficult with the confrontation of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects to argue .
It shows that the filter is not gelbgesichtig , but that the yellow face was pulled in the devaluing extreme .
Snapchat is not the only enterprise , which crosses this cultural trip wire .
The American culture seems to be complicated in an endless diversity and integration fight , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices , which we all hold in the hand .
And Snapchats large audience of young people - which are various in things race than their older opponents - could assume that rather to expect sensitivity .
If one of Snapchats filters produces a picture that it is insulting for a user “ like that it is many more difficult that such things remain unnoticed , than it was in former times the case ” said 25-year old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday .
On Thursday Zhu , which as a product manager and engineer for medium works , decided to delete their Snapchat account requested others to do the same .
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview it said that she believed that race-referred controversies reflect a lack of diversity with the attitude practices with Snapchat .
Zhu criticized to a large extent white , only male leadership and terminated its essay with a Hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
“ Either it does not have a various representation of humans with other skin colors in her staff , so that they can make such decisions , ” said the chinesich American Zhu , “ or it has humans with other skin colors , to say which work there , but not in positions , in those they are itself or probably-feel , around which against it . ”
Others divide its opinion , a complaint , the Snapchat left to a large extent unanswered .
The enterprise publishes no numbers for the diversity of its staff and refers to its status as private enterprise .
On Thursday it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees but loud a spokesman the enterprise adjusted recently a staff responsible person , who concentrates on underrepresented subpopulations and on internal integration efforts .
Zhu said for its part the fact that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added , “ I asked myself , whether they need more user like us , in order to be able to say that is not o.k . ”

B27-Sanierung : Restaurants suffer from blockage
At the speed , with which B 27 one reorganizes , it gives to grumble nothing .
For the responsible persons of the construction work , which begins in the morning at 5.30 o'clock and ends only around 20 o'clock , there is everywhere praise .
“ Those made , tell everything rather jaggedly ” Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet gas station .
That is a superteam .
There is also no delay .
The building site could be moved at the beginning of the week to the half time according to plan after the south , to at the end of Octobers should everything be finished .
Also the obligingness for the construction work of the responsible persons is praised , about if it concerns the facility from auxiliary entries .
Since the building site hiked on Monday after the south and also the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was waived and so that also the connection exists to Rottenburg again , the traffic conditions relaxed within the place .
The citizens can drive on now from Ofterdingen from B 27 again reciprocally .
Alternate traffic by the place seems to decrease .
“ There it gave partial substantial complaints ” , says for the traffic-technical management of the redevelopment responsible person deputy municipal managers to Florian King .
The adjacents resident of brook sentence road , stone salmon route , Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many secret means looked for each other and rather trusted their Navi as the sign-posting .
Which led to the fact that some truck in populated areas verfranste itself .
Since also the speed limits were not kept , demanded the community strengthens the measuring vehicle from Mössingen on .
“ There were substantial excesses ” , say King , which made itself well-informed over the situation times locally .
There two to three per minute were already flashed .
The fastest one was with 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo-30-Zone on the way .
Since the building site moved on , it became however calmer .
For the businessmen at B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is again open .
Into the cards to look businessmen do not leave themselves gladly .
But that with them to revenue break-downs led B 27-Sanierung , it lets see through everyone , which one asks .
However some more are less concerned and some .
Who has to do with the “ end customers ” less , thus for other companies produced , for that the redevelopment has hardly consequences .
In addition , also with the car dealership Maier speaks Thomas Sulz of a “ at the most easy decrease ” , grants that naturally “ irregular customers are missing ” .
At the strongest shaken the restaurants are along the road .
J. Albert Göhner , Inhaber of the Steakhouse , before times crown , finds clear words .
That already is existence-threatening .
Not only it met it , but all restaurants “ hard ” .
The customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil were missing .
We must be glad over each euro revenue .
It numbers the turnover losses on “ far over 50 percent ” .
The road redevelopment threw its enterprise back “ by two years ” .
It half of its employees had to dismiss .
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half were to dismiss , had the policy differently reacted .
Instead head of the provincial government Jörg Schmidt answered to a request of Göhner , whether there could be a financial reconciliation , with the reference , the restaurant profits otherwise from the advantages the situation at B 27 . Now it must carry just also the disadvantages , which arise as a result of the redevelopment .
Göhner knows from other districts , where something so more generously one handled .
With all complaints Göhner is sure itself that its restaurant will continue .
Finally the family business is settled already since here 1715 , refers it to long history .
That other regular customers look in now because of the complicated traffic management less frequently , he can understand .
If one can not to drive here , it is also elsewhere beautiful .
That its master clientele returns after the end of the repair works again , to it Göhner does not have doubts .
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu Göhner regards the effects of B 27-Bauarbeiten its customers as the largest crisis , which experienced its restaurant in its history of many years .
Six months construction work , that is already brutal .

Better flow of traffic on the feeder route
Accumulates regularly on the by-pass road - here a picture from November .
But that is to change : The right turn-off lane is to be extended .
That is a good message for all drivers , who in the rush hour on the environment road each evening in the back-up , if they drive over the feeder route ( A 43 ) .
The national enterprise road construction extends on coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . /17 August ) within the range between the hammer road and the departure Weseler road the Rechtsabbiegerspur around 700 meters .
Drivers can contrive then directly from the hammer road right .
The large advantage : Traffic divides itself more promptly , whereby the global process on the much-traveled section of the federal highway 51 is improved .
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU parliamentary group in the district agency Münster west .
The lane narrowing on the feeder makes the drivers nervous particularly between 17 and 19 o'clock .
The back pressure reaches sometimes also beyond that on workdays up to the bridge over the Albersloher way and .
Reason is the needle eye on B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler road .
Traffic only single-lane one is directed off here over the motorway bridge .
The second trace had to be back-built forwards for years well in-three-quarter .
The reason : Static calculations had showed that the bridge does not possess no more the necessary carrying capacity , in order to take up above all the heavy transport two-lane .
How long this bottleneck and the associated work-daily back-up will persist , the responsible national enterprise can not say .
However is to be counted with years : Because the bridge has an official rest service life up to the year 2034 .
For the extension of the right turn-off lane the national enterprise selected consciously the traffic-weaker time in the vacations , because on handicaps is to be counted .
Traffic is led past on Tuesday and on Wednesday single-lane at the building site .

Gotten : Because of positive doping sample weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland may not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - which become Olympic Games 2016 overshadowed by first official cases of doping .
A gotten athlete would have won nearly a medal .
Before the seventh match day first official cases of doping are the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro admit become .
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000-Meter-Hindernisläuferin Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - directly before the beginning of the anyway critically eyed track-and-field events competitions these news comes to the wrong time .
With Chen on past Sunday the diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide had been already proven , which is used as masking means for doping UBS dancing .
The international sport Court of Justice CAS confirmed its exclusion of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time .
On Sunday the 18-year old fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly had occupied , only by 0.09 seconds missed it thereby the bronze medal .
On Friday Chen should have participated in the advances over 50 m freestyle .
Chen requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing at the international olympic committee ( IOC ) .
The national federation takes the affair “ very seriously and requires of Chen full co-operation with the investigations ” , to quoted Xinhua from a report : “ We will co-operate with the international sport Court of Justice CAS and will become the judgement to accept ” .
For the first time in history no more is responsible the IOC , but CAS for sanctioning the sportsmen with positive cases .
Likewise in the night of Rio the message oozed over the positive sample with Danekowa , the 33-year old went thereby even into the offensive .
“ I had three tests , all negatively , and my fourth test was ” , this was positively “ an unbelievable shock ” , said it to the Bulgarian TV-transmitter BNT .
It is innocent , “ the only explanation could food supplements be ” , explained the athlete .
According to the report it is to concern with the forbidden substance the blood doping agent EPO .
Danekowa was provisionally suspended , according to BNT is to have already positively failed also the B-sample .
Of Bulgaria Prime Minister Bojko Borissow announced itself immediately with criticism at the athlete to word .
“ I do not understand , why the sportsmen draw , said not the correct conclusions ” he : “ We Bulgarian stand under observation , so many were already excluded ” .
So about all weight lifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation may not participate in Rio .
On Friday also the case became “ Adrian Zielinski ” admits , who became London olympia winner in the class up to 85 kg like its brother Tomasz three days before positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon tested .
Both deny the income , both may however not in the class up to 94 kg start .
Before the start of the light athletes the case Danekowa is particularly a further heavy impact for the reputation of the entire kind of sport .
The world union IAAF had forbidden with one exception because of systematic doping the start , also the runner nation Kenya to the complete Russian crew produced in Rio numerous bad news .
In swimming besides earlier offences in China had ensured for violent arguments also between the athletes .
Thus the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese olympia winner Sun Yang harshly .
“ Sun Yang pees purple . ”
“ If I the podium over 200 m freestyle see , want to hand over I ” , said myself Lacourt in the French radio .
Sun was located besides in the center of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton .
“ I do not have time and no respect for doping cheats ” , said to this .
Sun had been positively tested 2014 with the Chinese championships on the stimulant Trimetazidin , had to serve however only a three-month barrier .

England must direct the olympic spirit and extend Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local municipalities and in all of London , but generally speaking country .
For me that represented the largest attraction Heathrows , exactly the same as at that time in 2012 in London , when we operated a large expenditure , in order to guarantee that all our nations and regions profited from the plays .
The Olympiad brought large advantages for Stratford and the East ends .
And that will again reach , as we for local men and companies create new possibilities in close proximity to Heathrow .
For our local communities we will create alone already 10,000 new training places , 40,000 new jobs and for youth unemployment in the airport environment an end will prepare .
As it us in London ahead 2012 were , it such will give , which will think that the challenge of the extension is too large Heathrows .
It was told me that England will be ready for the plays never and that we will disgrace ourselves on the world stage .
The sceptics had 2012 injustice and them also with Heathrow will wrongly lie .
There are always obstacles for overcoming , but Heathrow answers each question posed to him .
Like the Olympic Games Heathrow for many is and not for particulars an infrastructure project .
Extension is a possibility , in order to create up to 180.000 new jobs , £211 billion at witschaftlichem growth and to leave a legacy of abilities and occupation both around the airport and in completely GB .
We have a great team in Heathrow , which a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget converted , of the T5 - which was selected five years in consequence to the world-best airport terminal , up to the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequented gangways of the world .
Now they stand ready a third gangway to supply , which is supported by £16 billions at private investments .
The London of plays of 2012 was a large success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will likewise be one .
It is time that we direct this olympic spirit and extends Heathrow as well as secures our future trade and a legacy of talents and creates occupation , on which England be proud can .

A culture of the Political Correctness led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored like a destroying government report today revealed .
The former cabinet member sir Eric Pickles attacks verbal the police , election observer and city halls proofs of choice abuse due to “ hypersensitivenesses concerning ethnicity and religion ” to have ignored .
The former Minister for integration and local government , which are now a Antkorruptionskönig , it said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be permitted the police to furnish shut-off volumes outside from polling booths in order intimidated voters to protect .
It recommends that voters should lead a document of identification with itself , in order to prove with elections their identity .
At present a voter must call only its name and address .
The report suggests laying not removable ink on on the finger of a person if they deliver their vote , in order to prevent that someone selects twice .
Whistleblower should receive more protection , say sir Eric .
It demands that the press more entrance to community documents and decisions of not official Kommittees or working groups should have .
“ Also the local government before the broader corruption and finance fraud culture , which accompany with it , does not only serve protects , ” said it against electoral fraud , but is .
The report was arranged of the Downing Street as consequence of the Tower Hamlets of choice scandal in the east of London .
Last year decided a special choice court that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany at corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
The court found that Rahman the religious feelings of its Muslim community would have perverted `` in cynical way ” and that it would have hushed its critics with racing SiS mash and Islamophobienanschuldigungen .
Rahman is to have led “ its campaign on the basis that it is the religöse obligation of Muslims , it to select . ”
Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation , with which a person selects as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be generally speaking country of proofs for fraud .
He expressed himself in particular alarming to the fraudulent absentee voting - at older members would have made the Muslim community pressure on people to select a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , shown , made several recommendations , in order to clean the choice system , including leading documents of identification , in order to prove the identity
In its report it means : “ As proof it was attached that pressure was exerted on members in need of protection of some ethnic minorities , in particular women and young people , in order to select in accordance with the will the older ones , in particular communities with background of Pakistan or of Bangladesh .
“ There were doubts that… national institutions would knowingly have ignored such a behavior due to “ politically correct ” hypersensitivenesses concerning the ethnicity and religion . ”
Sir Eric expressed 50 recommendations , in order to clean the system to stop including the prohibition that political activists works on absentee voting documents , in order “ choice elections ” .
The report , which is considered by Theresa May , requires also harder registration examinations , in order to prevent that the choice listing is used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
Options consider to ask voters before the choice for your document of identification .
Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as it delivered her voice , in order to prevent that someone selects twice .
To accomplish systematic examinations over the nationality of a person , in order to guarantee that they are entitled to vote .
A three-year delimitation on requests for an automatic absentee voting .
Prohibition that political activists works on complete absentee votings and envelopes of absentee votings .
Give the power to the police to furnish closing around choice elections .
A law change , which facilitates an accusation because of intimidation in accordance with the Representation OF the People act 1983 ( representative government law 1983 ) .
Photographing prohibition in choice elections .
Requirement that only English in the choice elections may be used ( with exception of Wales ) .
Intensification of the training , in order to guarantee that the employees implement the rule that voters go alone into the polling booth .
Sir Eric falls over the metropolitan policy and finds it “ amazingly ” that after the Tower Hamlets case a charge one did not place .
“ The choice court explained , ” said Lutfur Rahman and its deputy for due to a litany at corrupt and illegal practices as unfit it .
It became due to a set of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal procedure - guiltily admits .
He criticizes also ineffective “ checking off controls ” of the choice registration elections of the city halls .
Sir Eric said : “ The court decision in Tower Hamlets from the last year was a warning signal .
Our country carries a proud inheritance , but the causing concern and covered propagation of electoral fraud and denying some authorities as the mother of the parliaments threatens this good reputation .

The fees per cubic meter waste water amount to starting from 1 October 2016 for the range of the sewage system Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of so far 2.10 euros ; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros ( so far 2.26 euros ) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros ( so far 2.18 euros ) .
With the plant in Azendorf the waste water fee will at the latest again increase if appropriate improvement measures become necessary .
After a rough calculation the waste water price in Azendorf about 4.37 euros per cubic meter will then be .
How mayor Bernd Steinhäuser ( CSU ) reported , with the approval of the household by the district administration office Kulmbach was stated that for these sewage systems Unterdeckungen accumulate .
The market Kasendorf is obligated due to legal bases to operate the plants cost-hitting a corner .
Starting from 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as the trade and industrial companies from Welschenkahl , new village , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg more deeply into the purse will have to reach .
The increases in charges lie between 48 and 67 percent .
As administrative leader pointed Herbert Schmidt to the committee out , a new calculation of the fees was necessary for the sewage systems of the market community .
In the period of October 2016 until September 2020 also over and/or Unterdeckungen from the preceding calculation period is to be adjusted .
Schmidt justified the serious increases in charges with the fact that it acts with all three sewage systems around relatively small facilities with a very small waste water accumulation , which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
Thus due to the small distribution basis for example expenditures for necessary repairs would affect themselves several thousand euros seriously .
Besides the waste water arising is easily declining in all three plants .
Further in the past calculation period with all three plants not least due to their age redevelopment and repair expenditures to a substantial extent resulted .
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Welschenkahl , new village and Reuth as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years .
Schmidt referred to the fact that in the sewage system Azendorf the mechanical ventilating system had to be exchanged due to a damage .
In the pumping plant Welschenkahl had to be overhauled those almost 20 years old conveyor plants by reason on and with the pond purification plant Lopp had after almost 20 years enterprise the first sludge pond excavated , the sewage sludge to be disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility inserted , in order to be able to keep the water-legal defaults also in the future .
Schmidt : “ To these extraordinary expenditures the updated care and maintenance costs came to consider those accordingly in the new calculation period are . ”
The same is valid for cost of electricity , to which with the previous calculation in the years 2011/2012 still clearly under the current level were .
It made stone houses clear that with the small waste water accumulation in the three plants the expenditures for the enterprise and maintenance pierce “ fully ” .
, Supplemental Schmidt remained exempted , the market community from large maintenance costs with the sewage systems in the past 20 years .
The situation for the plants mentioned will in the long term remain further precarious in opinion of stone houses , particularly since one will not extend the supply area of the waste water special purpose association Friesenbachtal by these plants can , because it concerns in deficit facilities .

The £2-pro day medicine , the cardiac infarct risk to lower can
Thousands of heart attack patients will profit from a £2-pro day medicine , after by the authorities one recommended to give this to more people for a longer period .
The coagulate-restraining medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repetitive cardiac infarcts for people with a heart illness .
The medicine is given already 12 months long after a cardiac infarct , whereby the risk of an apoplexy or a further cardiac infarct is reduced .
The regulatory authority NICE of NHS recommended a four years long income , in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further .
The regulatory authority NICE of NHS recommended a four years long income , in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further .
Approximately 140,000 people suffer each year a cardiac infarct and a quarter of it suffer a further cardiac infarct or an apoplexy .
Cardiac infarcts and apoplexies are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls , which form surfaces .
If the surface breaks apart , it can cause a blood clot , which causes flow of blood up to the heart clogged and thus a cardiac infarct .
If the blood clot separates , it can flow by the bloodstream and clog flow of blood to the brain , which causes an apoplexy .
People , who had already a cardiac infarct , are subject to a higher risk a further to have .
Ticagrelor , which is manufactured by the British enterprise AstraZeneca and under the trade name Brilique is driven out , reduces this risk , by making the formation of blood clots more improbable .
The instruction draft of NICE , which was today published , recommends a 12-month income of 90mg Ticagrelor , followed from 60mg with a twice daily income of Aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , Direktorin of the NICE of health technology evaluation center said : “ A quarter of all people , who suffered a cardiac infarct , has defiance of the availability of secondary prevention a further cardiac infarct or an apoplexy - often with disastrous consequences . ”
The fear of a renewed cardiac infarct can have substantial negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
The experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with Aspirin with the reduction of further cardiac infarcts and apoplexies at people , which had already a cardiac infarct .
By a provisional recommendation of Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of humans who can profit from it .
The information about the effectiveness and security of Ticagrelor - above all the bleeding risk - are limited to one period of up to three years . The instruction draft does not recommend treatment , which goes beyond this period .

Terror bombing in Thailand - Austrian injured - several dead
The Austrian message in Thailand stands with the woman in contact , said the spokesman of the State Department , Thomas Schnöll , Freitagfrüh .
It suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital , this however already again leave could .
Their journey home planned it for at the beginning of Septembers .
Whether by the further explosions on the holiday-maker island Phuket are affected as well as in the southern cities Surat Thani , catch Nga , Trang and Chumphon likewise Austrian citizens , is for the time being still unclear .
The State Department is located in this connection in constant contact with the local authorities , thus to Schnöll .
In approximately 200 kilometers south the capital Bangkok the convenient Hua had exploded first on Thursday evening in a going out quarter of two bombs .
According to police one Thailänderin were killed and about 20 humans were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutchmen and three Italians .
Friday-early then again two explosive devices went highly , according to the authorities further humans were killed .
Also of Phuket in the early a bomb explosion was announced .
With the explosion in the proximity with holiday-makers bath beach Patong liked after police sources a cab driver were injured .
In Surat Thani at the southeast coast of the country exploded then a further bomb , which killed an urban employee .
The explosive device went according to the authorities in a flower bed before the district of the coastal police into air .
Finally still explosions in catch Nga and Trang at the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon at the southeast coast demanded several injured ones .
One proceeds from a connection with the explosions in Hua , it was said .
“ The bomb assassination attempts carry the same handwriting ” , said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday-early before journalists .
“ We assume it concerns a coordinated attack . ”
It is too early , in order to express itself to possible motives - probably concern it however the acts of Muslim rebels .
Also Thai media wanted to recognize a sample , which is typical for the bomb assassination attempts of Muslim separatists in the south of the country with the attacks .
The Thai police however explained , the assassination attempts would not stand in connection with the Islamist rebellion movement or with the international terrorism .
“ That is limited only local sabotage , to limited areas and provinces ” , said themselves a spokesman in Bangkok .
One assumes rather the bombs were put by opponents of the dominant military junta .
The authorities would have received secretofficial referring to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country in the past days - however they had not been informed about the exact time and the places .
Still is unclear , which puts group behind the attacks .
The police instructed its officials generally speaking country , security approximately around important government buildings as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , to strengthen restaurants and nightclub districts .
In Thailand there are smaller bomb attacks again and again , but are usually not directed it not against tourists .
In Hua lies a palace , which was used over years by of Thailand king Bhumibol Adulyadej .
After the present bomb explosions the Austrian State Department on its homepage recommends to absolutely carry out for the instructions of the Thai security authorities consequence .
High security risk ( security level 3 ) be valid for the provinces Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and environment .
After arguments between safety forces and Muslim population parts before not necessary travels into these provinces one advises against .
Increased security risk ( security level 2 ) be valid for the rest of the country .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday were made few days after a disputed referendum by a condition prepared by the military junta .
This grants large influence to the military also in the coming years .
Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan o cha said , the bombs had been an attempt to donate chaos during itself the country toward stability , an improvement of the economic situation and the tourism move .
The Militärunta , which had seized 2014 after a phase of bloody riots power , grants itself the kingdom again to stability and order to have led .
However also the military did not succeed in getting for years the rebellion of Muslim rebels smoldering in the extreme south of the country into the grasp .
In the conflict already more than 6500 humans were killed .

A disputed baseball star retires
The tears ran with Alex Rodriguez faster than the US-baseball-star in best days from base to base .
After his emotional resignation publication the 41 years old professional will carry a last mark the tricot of its New York Yankees on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays .
“ I love this play and this team . ”
“ I say 'Goodbye ' to both ” , explained the 14-malige all-star game participant major League baseball ( MLB ) .
Three times Rodriguez was selected to the most valuable player of the league , 2009 won it with the Yankees the World Series .
Its signature under a toe annual contract gave to it since 2007 annually 27 million US Dollar .
Up to the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 it functions in the future than advisors and youth coach - with full content .
As a player it paid Rodriguez back long time with achievement .
With 696 Homeruns , 3114 hits and 2021 points for its teams ( “ run ” ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yankees it created some milestones .
With the resound OF Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays exhibit only two further baseball players in the most important statistics similar values .
But into the fame hall of the baseball the 41-year old might not be taken up nevertheless .
Because Rodriguez - nickname “ A-Rod ” - on the field was so successful , so disputed is its occurrence outside of the place .
Already 2009 admitted the superstar with “ ESPN ” between 2001 and 2003 forbidden steroids to itself to have taken .
In August 2013 it became closed due to an involvement in the so-called biogenous SiS scandal to at the end of 2014 for 211 portions .

Russia and Turkey : A “ alliance of outsiders ” ?
It was a gesture , which terminated a crisis .
The leaders Russlands and Turkey met on Tuesday , in order to give themselves the hands and to announce an official end of the eight months long persisting war of the words and economic sanctions .
But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburger of palace in receipt , I can not refuse myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation at most .
There was the handshake , yes .
But of Putin smile worked schmallippig and he radiated hardly warmth , even for his reserved conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan however spoke repetitive of its “ dear friend ” Putin - according to a report whole five time .
I could not count it any longer .
He promised also the fact that the relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis will even still improve but .
On the next day a newspaper that Erdogan would have behaved in such a way , described as if something bad would have never happened .
Its enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite to me .
But , a lasting coolness radiating from Putin showed that head of state Russlands had not forgotten the anything .
Rather the cause of the crisis was first , which it mentioned in its introduction words : the firing of a Russian combat aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow reaction at the time was inflamed with rage .
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of , Russia in the backs pleases to be .
Offence was even still larger , since it was committed by an alleged friend .
The Vetrauen will again construct with difficulty , if become not even impossible .
The public opinion in Russia changed itself for November .
Months long implemented the state-controlled mediums a violent , unrestricted attack on Ankara .
At once it seemed , as if the Turks for everything would carry the debt .
The accusations were most serious from leading officials that Erdogans own family would have profited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so-called Islamic state .
It denied this vehemently .
But in St. Petersburg the official message that it was time read , to look forward .
Finally this meeting took place only , because Putin received the apology , which it wanted to hear from president Erdogan .
Russia could book a kind victory .
For Ankara the advantages of an armistice are clearly obvious .
Erdogan needs primarily all friends , whom he can get , after he was relieved last month with a failed coup d'etat nearly of his office .
Repetitive terrorist raids on Turkey likewise shook it .
But there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions met Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights , which bring each year usually several millions Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
The number decreased around nearly 90 % .
In Russia tour operators and charter companies will be relieved , if the flights are again taken up .
They count on a lateseasonal attack to the Mediterranean .
This week prognosticated public television cheaper fruit and vegetable , as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported goods are again permitted .
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows : “ Tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ”
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is furious on the west , since it regards its reaction to the tried seizure of power as weak answer .
In addition continuous resentment over the snail speed of the EU accession negotiations and the Putin come - which are eager to pull from the cool tendency benefit and to reduce the relationship of Turkey with the west .
The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara with security for the fact that he demanded support for the selected state organs after the tried coup d'etat .
That is for Moscow mind you a matter of course , which has even a low-sitting fear of regime changes .
The summit in this glossful palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent one , as it described me an analyst once , to “ alliance of outsiders ” : two countries , of the west offended and badly treated feel and now groups .
Nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , exist between the two still large differences .
The largest difference is Syria , where Moscow gave itself recently the role as a peacemaker , but where opposite sides support Russia and Turkey .
It could be characteristic that after nearly three hours at Erstgesprächen both presidents to the press conference stated that they would not have even touched the topic .
The president of Turkey avoided to answer it intentionally to a question over its differences , during Putin itself in addition decided these to stress .
No clear consent is present over it where a common denominator can be found to Syria .
But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect Disaster , when the NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter plane - it is surely better that the two heads of state talk again with one another at least .

“ A generation protests ” in Ethiopia , Long an allying of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators , who demand political changes in Ethiopia , encountered violent resistance of the government .
Witnesses state that tens of protesting was killed during the collisions with the police with shootings .
Is to be broken down Ethiopia about ?
In the last ten years it was one of the sturdiest countries of Africa , a solid allying of the west with a fast growing economy .
But in the last months protests shook the country against the government and expanded into more and more areas .
Last week stormed thousands of people on the roads and required fundamental political changes .
The answer the government was merciless according to human rights organizations .
Witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed at tens of unarmed demonstrators .
In the circulation videos present over the protests , which are supposed from the latter or at the beginning of this year , show up like security personnel young people with sticks strike , while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall .
The boss of the un agency for human rights requires now a detailed investigation .
“ It was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even still more difficult , ” said Rashid Abdi , the project manager the horn of Africa that internationally Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most densely populated country of Africa and its stability becomes estimated from the west .
American Militär-und of secret services co-operates closely with the Ethiopians , in order to fight dangers of terrorism beyond the region , in particular in Somalia . Only few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much western assistance .
Of Ethiopia economy expanded in the considerable speed .
Its infrastructure improved drastically - it gives a new commuter course in the capital to Addis Abeba .
The roads are usually calmly , safe and clean .
Even if Ethiopia everything else were as a model for democracy - human rights organizations stated sequentially the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country became reduced , whereby dissidents were effectively hushed .
Many were sent , killed into the exile or into the prison or floated into the widths of the desert .
But that could change .
“ If you people suppress and this no other options have except to protest , break it off , ” said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
The entire youth protests .
A generation protests .
There are numerous complaints , which take everything off of the use of land up to the stranglehold regarding power of the governing coalition .
After an extensively criticized choice the governing party and control its allied ones the last seat of the opposition received last year and now 100 percent of the parliament .
At the same time the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea ; a fight for this jagged , disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo liberation front or the national liberation front of the Ogaden , which was more or less defeated in the last years , which could turbulences use and again arm themselves .
Several factors explain , why feelings of the embitterment explode after years before itself of the Hinköchelns under the surface now .
First seems harmless : Smartphones .
Only in the last years a great many Ethiopians in the position were to communicate by means of the social media since cheaper smartphones became ever more frequent and improved the Internet services .
Even if the government closes the entrance to Facebook and Twitter , which does it in regular intervals , particularly with protests , many people can communicate still over Internet Proxies , which hide , where they are .
Several young Ethiopians indicated that they met in such a way to protests .
The second factor is the fact that it more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas which , gives two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia .
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
Since Äonen prospered the Amharas , which come from Äthopiens predominantly Christian highlands , in which politics and economy , while they exploited the Oromos , from which many Muslims are and live in flat country areas .
In addition , changes .
“ We are about to coordinate under a screen ” said Mulatu Gemechu , a leader of the Oromos .
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos .
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia unfair-proves by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray is dominated , those approximately 6 percent of the population to constitute and in the military , in the secret services , in the trade and the policy dominantly are .
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr. Meles , a former rebel leader , was 2012 17 years long up to its death at a not publicly made illness in the year of Ethiopia prime minister .
It was viewed as a tactical genius , a man , who could think around corners .
To analysts say that it was particularly experienced to notice early signs of discontent and use particular agents , in order opponents to work on and it innocuous make .
“ It is missing to the present regime at this basic fate , ” said Mr. Abdi , a conflict analyst .
Of Ethiopia of new prime ministers , Hailemariam Desalegn , for relatively obscure reasons was selected , in order to take the position of Mr. Meles .
Differently than Mr. Meles , who came from the Tigray region of north Ethiopia , Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south .
Analysts say that it does not enjoy the confidence from the Tigray controlled security agencies .
Many fear that the result more bloodshed will be .
The last mark that Ethiopia experienced such a riot was 2005 , after thousands protested against elections , which bungled according to information of analysts apparently from the government and were afterwards stolen .
During the raids following on it many protesting were killed , even if than in the last months were less and this time of the riots passed relatively fast .
Development experts praised of Ethiopia leader for their visionary infrastructure planning , like the new commuter course , as well as for its measurable progress with the fight against poverty .
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal disfavor of the Ethiopian government .
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
Protesting in Gondar , a amharischen city , of Tigray led business attacked last month and the hate opposite the Tigray become ever more usual in the social media .
Analysts say that the protests bring the USA and other western allied one into their own position .
The American government used Ethiopia as basis for Dronenflüge over the neighbouring Somalia , even if it communicated recently that she closed this basis .
While the west wants to support clearly the democracy , it does not want that its allying in an already volatile area breaks down .
“ This , ” said Mr. Abdi , “ is a very thin tightrope walk . ”

NASA climatic model : Venus was once habitable
The Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections new NASA of a climatic model .
Scientists at the Goddard of institutes for space Studies of NASA developed a model , in order to discover the past of the Venus on the basis from tools and algorithms , which resemble those from climatologists .
The model was sketched , in order to determine , whether the Venus with their were called , waterless surface and CO2 densities atmosphere once earthsimilar conditions to have exhibited could .
Scientists pointed before to the fact that the slow revolution of the Venus could be explained by their close atmosphere .
But newest simulation points to the fact that a thin , earthsimilar atmosphere could have had the Venus and nevertheless slowly kept turning themselves .
The model lit up also the topography of the early Venus .
The planet exhibited probably more dry areas than de Erde , but had once enough water and geographical variability to accommodate over lives and before fast evaporation protected .
The early Venus profited also from a sun , which was more matte 30 percent .
“ In the GISS model simulation the slow revolution of the Venus exposes their daily side of the sun nearly two months long , ” explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release .
This warms up the surface and produces rains , which creates a thick layer clouds , which like an umbrella works , in order to shield the surface from a majority of the solar heat .
The result are average temperatures , which are cool some degrees as those the earth today .
The model brought a history out of the Venus , which the evolution resembles , which was assumed before by planet researchers .
Although it was probably habitable once , were the Venus -- in the run more mehrer billions years -- too much heat and ultraviolet light suspended .
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapour by the ultraviolet light one burned away .
As its hydraulic gene stayed only a thick atmosphere at carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect escaped -- the Venus , which like we know it today .
The researchers divided the results of their new Venus Klimamodells in the Geophysical Research Letters .

Royal Bank OF Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
The brand RBS is to be reduced according to the chief executive of the bank only more to a Back Office role .
Royal Bank OF Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer will be available .
Ross McEwan communicated Scotland to the BBC that the brand RBS with the global ambitions of the bank were connected .
The bank dissociated itself since then , when it before eight years nearly collapsed and had to be saved .
In this time brand strategists used “ RBS ” to protect other final consumer financial brands .
It supported the international sport with millions pound at sponsoring , of the Six nation rugby up to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
But now it decided to move more national brands into the focus .
Royal Bank OF Scotland only for customers in Scotland will be available , but one will not initialize .
In England and Wales all PUCB becomes references , which changes decentralized head office and the stock exchange quotation to NatWest .
The brand Ulster bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There is other one , smaller brands for the private customer business , which will receive more meaning - Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond and Holt 's Military bank .
McEwan was interviewed during an inspection tour by customers and employees into Inverness shire .
It divided the BBC Scotland with : “ The brand PUCB will become now our investor brand as well as the brand , under which our employees will be employed , there we more a bank of brands . ”
When the bank became a global brand , RBS became the global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local of goals .
Each of these brands will be located somewhat perfectly in their own communities for different one and our employees will become under these brands with the customers to work .
RBS already stated that its Six nation sponsoring any longer it would not continue becomes and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sport sponsoring .
“ It is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands because as we concentrate on the inside ( we have in demand ) to make this a better bank for customers ? ” the chief executive said .
It would have been before three years very cynical , if we had said that we will be for our customers a great bank and these brands would have launched .
But with our work , which on customer needs and our not own , I think focus , one many changes will see .
We can launch these brands again , from there think I that the time came .

Why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
That is , which I introduce myself under the woman Olympic team in doing gymnastics and which from more than one reason .
First of all I participate since 1984 with each Summer Olympic Games and the USA was never so dominantly .
And secondly : This crew has three turn gutters , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren “ Laurie ” Hernandez , which worked for many young girls of other skin color inspiring .
Structure this crew , which Aly Raisman , which is Jew and is Madison Kocian , the catholic , round off , make everyone proudly .
This crew reflects finally the USA .
It solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the point of this kind of sport .
In the last four years the number one was under the female turn gutters an Afro American .
Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 .
That shows strength .
With the last Olympic Games a Gabby Douglas 's was surprising olympia winner and America was jubilant .
Now the world in the position , a witness of the unbelievable achievement of the three-way world champion Simone Biles was to be Douglas and Laurie Hernandez like it unexpected , but masterful Gymastikroutinen supplied .
On Thursday Simone became the fourth , heterosexual American , who won during an individual multi-combat event for women Gold .
Crew member Aly Raisman won silver .
We experience the point of this kind of sport , but turn classes do not look generally speaking country in such a way .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie knocked all the same way as Aly and Madison , in order to create it into the olympic team .
They are the “ last five ” , because the next Olympic team will have only four turn gutters in the crew . In addition that is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach .
But the reality looks in such a way that doing gymnastics an expensive sport is and gymnasts are responsible primarily in private gymnastics clubs , which will maintain from parents those for the training , facility , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their gymnast and families ) . The list can be continued at will .
The majority of these gymnastics clubs lie in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business .
In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and that are for the families an expensive and long-term commitment .
Aimee Boorman , Trainerin of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , Trainerin of Laurie Hernandez , have both their athletes to have trained , since then her with doing gymnastics to have begun .
We must make aun innumerable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie , for the communities possible a leistbareres and more easily accessible Turntrainung .
I created my turn foundation of 20 years .
With my events we ordered free and affordable doing gymnastics in Harlem for over 15.000 urban young people ( above all black and Hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
In September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) , in order to offer to the youth high-quality doing gymnastics , which earn the possibility of learning and of profiting from this great olympic kind of sport to .
Do gymnastics develop strength , flexibility and co-ordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the spirit .
This combination offers lifelong advantages for the health as well as for school and vocational success .
The inspiration of this crew , which thousand young girls bring to it , is to be interested in doing gymnastics and that is great .
It is so important to participate in the sport particularly for girls .
That is a in such a way stretching time .
Thank if Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of “ Girl power ” by getting the olympic crew gold and , if barrel it thanks so many young girls with different background motivated to become in order to begin their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .

Simone Biles creates gold in the lady doing gymnastics
Forget the pressure .
Forget hype .
Simone Biles is immune on all that .
Dynamically on the vaulting horse .
Easy on the bar .
Breath-taking one on the ground .
On whole line brilliantly .
And now finally also olympia winner .
The 19-year old American Turnerin ascended on Thursday to the multi-combat title and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the searchlight beam of the Olympic Games .
Their total result of 62,198 was appropriate clearly before the silver medal winners and “ final Five ” - for crew companion Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina .
The Americans Simone Biles Brazil does gymnastics , Thursday on the balance beam during the single multi-combat final of the women in the artistic gymnastics with the olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American , some multi-combat title wins and altogether the fifth , while she strengthens her call to be the best one of their generation or even at all .
It broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their be enough for travel in this moment an end found .
This success places it into the same league as singular athletes as Michael Phelps , which brought their kinds of sport to new heights :
Biles won the last three years their kind of sport dominated , 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , which contain a mixture from ambition and precision that the olympia winner said Mary Lou Retton of 1984 of it that it is “ the best Turnerin , which I ever saw . ”
It expected it a last examination in Brazil , a competition , which did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations .
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in jump , Texas return , would be as disappointment to be viewed .
The Americans Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace themselves , after they won in each case gold and silver in the single multi-combat final of the women in the artistic gymnastics with the olympic summer games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Biles got the first medal on Tuesday , while she served herself on the parting celebration of the crew co-ordinator Martha Karolyi committing in retirement as exclamation mark .
Although Biles insisted on it , during its long way on the point , the future to have never planned , is not really true that .
A part of their ground exercises - which contain its typical Tumbling passport - is co-ordinated with Latin American music , which would fit at home on the road outside of the olympia arena in Rio .
That is not coincidence .
This girl , who was adopted of its grandparents as a small child and discovered of coach Aimee Boormans mother during a school trip into the gymnasium , in the Boorman trained , became the strength .
It lost no more multi-combat competition since the summer 2013 , a winning streak , which will so for a long time continue , as it wishes Biles .
Even if Mustafina led by two turns easily , the picture trügte .
Balance beams and floor exercises - in those Biles the world champion title holds - lay in wait .
It got again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and set with 15.933 on the ground still a one on it .
Raisman embraced it gently as it their Endergbnis expected - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shining red , white and blue Eyeliner , when the vision , which described it once in her collecting book , became the reality .
The achievement Raismans was a revenge for the last mark before four years , when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake at Mustafina went .
This time the 22-year old captain , who is called by the Americans “ granny ” , had a lead .
After its ground exercise she threw kiss hands to the audience , overwhelmed from a comeback , which appeared doubtful sometimes .
Which concerns Biles , then the fast spreading Tweet of the 19-year old has earlier this week a completely new meaning of :

Community , spirit , health : Sing do seniors well
Singing already accompanied Ursel Kipp their whole life : As a young girl it was in the school choir , in the teaching profession study occupied it the subject music , and today the 78-year old in a senior choir sings .
“ Singing moves me - emotional and physically ” , it describes .
For a sample it feels balanced , merrily and altogether more alive , says themselves it .
Completely besides she does thereby to her health and her spirit of something property .
Because singing is directly from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league .
Most seniors sing in the choir and divide with like-minded ones the joy in the music , describe Hackler .
By regular gathering seniors can social contacts attach and maintain .
Because frequently social and family structures at the age dissolve , a choir are then an ideal opportunity , in order to spend time with other humans .
This experience made also Ursel Kipp in its choir : To deny themselves “ and organize to be able and from each other learn to rely on the others - a choir is a completely special form of gathering ” .
To sing Hackler can be arduous in the positive sense , means .
Because seniors train a deep and controlled respiration .
Who demands its lung regularly , does not come also in the everyday life so fast from the breath .
Even if it concerns , the sound of the voice at the age too received , singing is an optimal hobby .
On older humans singing has often a completely special effect , says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Labor of the senior organizations .
In the older generations common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to the everyday life , both at school and in the spare time , explains it .
Lenz observes frequently that singing or hearing songs wakes many memories with older humans , often connected with positive feelings of their youth time .
By song texts and melodies dementia-gotten sick humans particularly remember themselves for a long time past events .
When singing the head besides a special achievement is demanded , explains Lenz .
To concentrate at the same time on the own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt thereby to the other singers - that is a large cognitive challenge .
Straight older humans , who live alone , practice in such a way , not to only concentrate on itself .
Another positive aspect is the acknowledgment , which one experiences by singing in the choir , means Hackler .
An enthusiastic audience is great praise .
Also the self-esteem grows by singing in the choir .
To be it shown : If I practice for a long time for something , I become better and exceed over me - this experience strengthens .
, In order to begin with singing , there are good reasons thus enough .
Who wants to try a new hobby out , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent guesses/advises Lenz .
One does not sing alone - with 50 singing humans , who hears there already , if times a tone goes beside it ?
In the search for the suitable offer have seniors different possibilities , says Hackler .
If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir , one can follow simply .
In addition many cities offer overviews of the choirs in the environment .
Who would like to sing in a church choir , can contact directly the community or the church chief .
One finds many senior choirs also over the Internet .
Who does not have an entrance to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbour can ask for assistance with the Internet search .
Who has desire to sing , should themselves absolutely a choir attach , guesses/advises Hackler .
Sing does to the soul well and has something release - is valid for each age .

Of Russia Putin chief of staff Sergei Ivanov fires
Russian president Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov to dismiss .
Ivanov was many years part of the closest confidence circle of Putin .
The 63-year old was appointed the particular agent for environmental and transport affairs .
In a statement of the Kremlin it reads that Putin without giving reasons arranged “ the dismissal Ivanovs of its obligations as a chairman of the Russian presidential administration ” .
Anton Vaino , who was since 2012 Ivanovs a deputy , was appointed his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is former diplomat .
born , he made his conclusion at the renowned national one Muscovite Institut for international relations ( MGIMO ) for 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn and worked in the message in Tokyo .
On the website of the Kremlin it ( on Russian ) means that he was late minutes boss and staff leader of government staff .
About its appointment he said as Putin : “ Thanks for your confidence . ”
I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of state relative bills and controls for the conversion of your instructions .
Putin communicated transmitters to the Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave its post and Vaino as its successor had recommended .
Do the smiling faces convince ?
This step made Moscow shrouded in mystery .
Sergei Ivanov was long time of one closest familiar Vladimir Putins and works as he for the Soviet secret service , the KGB .
As a chief of staff it was one of the most powerful men that of country .
With a meeting with president both men maintained Putin , who was on TV radiated , that the chief of staff withdraws on own desire .
But despite the smile for the cameras , here only few are of it convinced - above all now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
Is the subsequent of a kind struggle for power here thus present ?
At present nobody knows .
But the official statement - that a man , who was advertized once as a potential president would like to lead at once the Russian environmental policy - encountered large skepticism .
In its remarks at Putin , which are quoted on the website of the Kremlin , Ivanov said “ it is true that I had asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a discussion to entrust to me this very much complicated posts - one could almost say - cumbersome posts four years long .
As it turns out , I am since four years and eight months of chairmen of the Russian presidential administration .
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011 .
Before he was a deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense .
It is member of the Russian security council and like Putin former member of the state security service KGB .
Into the late 1990er years , when Putin of chairmen of the federal security agency ( FSB ) was , the KGB , Ivanov replaced its deputy was appointed .
As Putin to power called it arrived Ivanov as one of five people , which he to most familiar .
Once it was accepted that Ivanov could become after of Putin second term of office president of Russia , since a third term of office of Putin would have offended against the condition .
But this post was taken by a further , intimate allied Putin , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became an Prime Minister , before it became three and a half years later again the president .

More than only a Kardashian Reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition Vogue
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner of clan Kris are on the cover of the September edition in demand of US Vogue .
Kendall , which is brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and on the Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York ran , announced the news on its Instagram account on Thursday .
“ In an area of full people , which I love , the sight of this cover brought me to crying , ” wrote Kendall .
The exposure of cover a bizarre ( or simply Keeping UP with the Kardashians something similar ? ) followed , scripted Reality video , which shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family ( with exception of the cases of problem Rob and Caitlyn as well as in presence of the all-side popular Showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping UP Ryan Seacrest ) , as they forget covers of their sister and with a classical idiom ends : they planned all a surprise party .
That represents the plate-afflicted action to almost any birthday episode of a child transmission ( Seacrest brought the sentence , “ you thought that we would have forgotten you ? , ” with the honesty of an indication trick rabbit on a time slot at 8 o'clock ) , but their other girls had to somehow let Kris in the morning participate in this publicity .
With view to the September edition Vogue began a new era of the Kardashians with security .
Kendalls large sister Kim likes it , what concerns Vogue covers , struck ( they and her man Kanye West were on it in April 2014 to see ) , but covers of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
The September edition is for Vogue to usually most sold edition of the year .
With an extent , which resembles rather a book of pictures as a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number on on advertisers ( sound Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertisement ) .
The exposure of its cover star is so longingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine oozed still before the official publication .
Women , who already were on cover , cover Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
In the last years clearly more was “ famousnesses , those models ” than “ model , the famousnesses is ” on cover .
OSCAR winner and Dior Markenbotschafterin Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on cover , one year after lady Gaga the honour had .
But even with the slim chance that Mrs. Jenner - of the magazine as the “ break-through model ” of her generation is described - falls under the earlier category , it is it in good society .
This famousnesses is not related to famous people or Reality of star or young people today , that knows , like one a good Snapchat video turns ( even if of it everything applies to Jenner ) .
They are really talented women , who are characterised in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , which appeared on last cover , had one of the most successful years of its career with the publication of Lemonade .
Naturally Jenners success does not please everyone .
With its Reality TV history Jenners position was always somewhat strained in the fashion world .
In June the former Victoria 's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called it “ the muck malice of the instant . ”
These feelings cooked , when the message with the appearance Jenners on Vogue cover came out .
But seems to pass on the moroseness to harp on the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition Vogue .
It is in the true sense of the word a supermodel .
It runs for Marc Jacobs .
It makes advertisement for your priming of Estee Lauder .
They and all their sisters sell pictures of itself on its respective Paywall apps to you .
It sells made pictures of Cindy Crawfords 's daughter from it to the magazine LOVE .
And in their spare time it is to be seen in the Reality TV . Probably only , in order to see their sister Kourtney and their children .

Cats react more sensitively than tomcats to cries of the young animals
Biologists examined in Hanover , calling cat babies has which effect on adults of animals .
To their surprise the miaow did not let also the males cold - however they always behaved in contrast to the females equal .
Female cats can recognize the excitation degree of cat babies by the miaow of the small ones .
They react by ten percent faster to sounds of kittens , which believe themselves in large emergency , as scientists of the veterinary university and the medical university found Hanover out ( MHH ) .
Tomcats react also to the calls of kittens - however always same .
“ Obvious are important the acoustic differences between the miaow of less and strongly excited young animals for the males either not perceptibly or not ” , said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH .
It is Erstautorin of the study , which was published on this Friday in the specialist journal “ BMC Evolutionary Biology ” .
In a previous investigation the researcher team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries with the urgency of their assistance neediness differ .
Altogether nine adults tomcats and eight Kätzinnen from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed .
Them on the one hand calls were played by small ones , which were taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated from mother and brothers and sisters .
On the other hand they were confronted with cries by more strongly excited kittens , which were additionally raised .
The researchers consider their results despite the small sample meaningful .
“ All females , even those , which had still no own new generation , reacted differentiated to the cries ” , said Konerding .
They turned faster to the loudspeaker , if these calls of the very much more excited kittens played .
This ability is possibly innate or develops with sexual maturity .
“ A surprise was that the males reacted , said at all ” the biologist .
In the past scientists already several times examined the reactions of women and men with humans for baby noises .

Military guidance falsifies ISIS Geheimdienstinformationen , determines committee of the congress
Military personnel of the United States cent ral COMMAND would locally have permitted , announced changed intelligence information to draw over a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and in Syria than it the actual conditions a committee of inquiry of the congress in a report on Thursday .
The provisional report , provided by a task Force of the republican members of the Streitkräftekommitees , Geheimdienstkommitees and the Wehrbudgetkommites , reports of large discontent under cent ral COMMAND secret service analysts , which reported , how superiors changed their estimates to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state .
The cent ral the COMMAND , briefly Cencom , is military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which steers the American military operations in the Near East and central Asia .
“ Intelligence information , which of high-ranking Centcom commanders were typically nodded through , drew regularly a more positive picture of the American efforts against the terrorism as it the actual conditions would locally have permitted and was constantly more positive than analyses of other intelligence services ” , quoted a newspaper article the report .
“ Which happened , is with the Centcom unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders ” , determined Ken Calvert , republican member of the house of representatives .
The guidance errors in the Centcom reach up to the highest point of the organization .
The ten-page report shows details steady problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
Although it does not supply direct pointing out that tops of the government among Obama 's gave instructions to change the reports shows it , like analysts the pressure of their Vorgesetzen suspended saw itself , a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also well-known than ISIS or ISIL to draw .
“ During the first half-year 2015 many cent ral COMMANDs press releases , statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positively than it the facts correspond ” determined the report .
For example a Centcom of members announced publicly that a military recapture Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mossul , second largest city Iraq , remains further under control of the Islamic state .
“ After months of investigations , so much is clear. ” Mike Pompeo , republican congressional representatives from Kansas , in a statement said .
From the center of the year 2014 up to the center of the year 2015 the points of the cent ral COMMAND changed the intelligence reports , in order to play the danger down by ISIS in Iraq .
The republicans brought the task Force into being , after them it was passed on that analysts worryd themselves regarding the manipulation from reports to the Islamic state .
On Thursday published report will be completed still by more detailed realizations during the investigations to be continued .
Further investigations of the Centcom of reports are additional by the general inspector of the Ministry of Defense under way .
Democratic members of the Nachrichtendienstekomittees published their own realizations , which agreed with some of the conclusions of the republican task Force on Thursday .
“ In the years 2014 and 2015 the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the production from intelligence estimates to ISIL and the Iraqi security agencies ” , announced the höchstrangige democrat in the committee , member in the house of representatives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
This process , so Mr. Schiff , “ delayed the publication of intelligence reports ” , damaged the moral under analysts and “ excessively gave little area for deviating opinions . ”
But Mr. Schiff and the democrats indicated , no referring to an intervention of the white house for the Centcom analysts regarding “ determined political opinion ” have found .
The provisional results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by “ The DAILY Beast ” .
In past August New York Times von Ermittlungen reported the Pentagon , who were accepted after complaints by Centcom analyst by the general inspector .
As per Cmdr . Patrick Evans , a press spokesman the Pentagon , indicated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not commentate reports of the congress , while the investigations of the general inspector were still under way .
But it also indicated that “ experts have sometimes quite diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversy discussion of these important topics of the national defense . ”
The investigations have reactions over the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria outside ( a statement , which is made in the meantime by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
The accusations of the past year raised however the question , to what extent president Obama can rely on the cent ral the COMMAND for honest estimates of the military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis zones .
The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic state remind of disputes from more than ten years ago , than a Centcom analyst , Gregory Hooker wrote , a document over it , like the government at that time under George W. Bush against the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation troop in Iraq planned and little time on it distorted , to make itself over the consequences of the invasion from 2003 thoughts to .
Mr. Hooker played also a key role with the rebellion against the present reporting over the Islamic state .
Last year the team places around Mr. Hooker according to government agencies firmly that against the statements the government air strikes would not have significant effects against the refineries thought of the Islamic state on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refineries would have taken in enterprise , in order to sell oil on the black market .
This realization was not published however , reported the Times in September .
Centcoms of commanders at that time , gene . Lloyd J. Austin III , was criticized by members of the legislation because of its excessively positive estimate of the war situation with a hearing before the senate .
General Austin went in April into the retirement and became with the cent ral COMMAND by gene . Joseph L. Votel replaces .

Future of the Schmelzerei of Portland due to abolition of the energy contract questionably
The future of the aluminum melt of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the play , since the plant operator the energy supply contract will waive to quit and thus all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company communicated .
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria Anfang of this year to assign no further subsidies for the enterprise of the plant .
For 20 years a specified subsidy runs out in November .
Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland stand on the play .
Less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could not be endangered with a locking .
Beyond that it could come to domino effects , since the Schmelzerei uses approximately 10 percent of the entire generation of current of Victoria .
2014 closed Alcoa the POINT Henry Schmelzerei , which led last year to a locking of the Anglesea of power station .
The Schmelzerei of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a locking .
This step follows the speculations for many years regarding the future of the plant , originally as consequence of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity tariff for the plant .
AGL , which supplies the large Aluminiumschmelzerei with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley , communicated that it assumes three further owners will quit their contracts .
The plant is in the majority possession a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina , about which the Chinese enterprise CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions .
“ AGL assumes the plant in Portland is further operated , which means a further physical demand for river by the Schmelzerei ” communicated the enterprise .
AGL stated further that the contracts were so-called “ safeguard business ” , which should have stepped starting from November 2016 into force .
The contracts have a 12-month term of notice , so that they will end to 2017 .
“ Of from there it AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute in the financial year 17 to the incomes , ” said the current supplier .
All potential effects on the incomes on AGL starting from the GJ 18 are at present limited by the prognoses of the strong option markets for wholesale electricity tariffs .
AGL communicated that it had already copied the value of the contracts in its Jahresabschlus at a value of $ 187 million in “ expectation of a notice ” .
Alcoa said that the decision to write the contracts off which does not impair `` ability Alcoas… the Schmelzerei to operate or the current supply to the Schmelzerei not ensure ” .
The US enterprise said that it had locked 2010 a 20-annual contract with Loy Yang , which from November this year on to go in effect should , even if it still another explanation is guilty , why it from the contract withdrew .
Analysts warn Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant due to bad economical conditions of the industry before the possible locking the Portland in close proximity to Newcastle .
In reference to the statements of the analysts Anfang of the week the Head OF said operation Stephen Mikkelsen that Portland and Tomago approximately 900 megawatts at river use annually approximately 600 megawatts .
If both plants of the market should disappear , a substantial decrease of the demand would mean on [ electricity market ] .
And for us as generators that would not be good , ” said it .

Datenklau : So perfidiously hackers extort their ransom money
Programmers von Erpressungs-Malware seize up-to-date aimed enterprises on and are successful thereby .
According to a current survey of the malware defense specialists malware bytes under 540 enterprises in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the asked companies became at least once , partly repeated in the past twelve months victims of an attack with blackmailer software .
In Germany scarcely 20 percent of the companies was already once a goal of an Ransomware extortion .
Readily the ransom money demanded by the perpetrators paid 40 percent of the victims , in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
The perpetrators specialize their blackmailer software appreciably according to the observations of malware bytes in attacks into firm networks .
If they are there successful , that fails potential ransom money which can be extorted clearly more highly than with private users .
“ We observe up-to-date a terrifying fast evolution of the malware ” , explain malware byte boss of Marcin Kleczynski in the discussion with the “ world ” .
2008 was appropriate most malware programs still to send advertisement away .
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for itself .
First private users were the goal , but the change to firm attacks took place in the past months alarmingly fast .
Ransomware works after a simple sample : Once on the computer of a victim actively , it looks for purposefully after recently changed files as for instance Word , Excel or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos .
These files code the Ransomware and delete the originals effectively .
Subsequently , the software presents the demands of the blackmailers .
In order the final key code to the files too gotten , the victims money - usually in form of the Cryptowährung Bitcoin - must transfer .
But where with private users the personal photo database stands on the play , it concerns at companies sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stands still .
Accordingly more highly the damage fails , if a Ransomware slams shut .
22 percent of the German companies concerned turnover losses announced by Ransomware , to 13 percent had even the business activity completely to interrupt , to a case were humans in mortal danger .
In Germany hospitals victims of attacks , whose patient can be threatened by the loss of patient documents acutely , were already repeated .
“ We always say to the victims : Does not pay , if you promotes thereby only the problem ” , Kleczynski explains .
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies , which pay , gets their data back .
For managers it is difficult to reject in view of stop in the enterprise the demand of the perpetrators .
The hackers again know that and try everything , in order to develop a good reputation .
In a current study the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user surfaces and the contact with the blackmailers and to come to the result : The perpetrators actually try to develop a kind customer service in order to take more funds .
They explain to their victims by chat , how they can pay by Bitcoin , furnish freely accessible support websites or decode in vain example files .
And private individuals are released after payments by few hundred euros , must negotiate enterprises partly hard and pay sums of five figures , in order to get back their data unencrypted .
In view of the potential high and profits relatively without risk from the Ransomware extortion the hackers ever more professionally and to divide the work , explains itself security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos : “ Individual person can write a Ransomware about within one week . ”
More probable is it however that it concerns three or four people .
The programmers sell their malware then in form of a software component system to the actual blackmailers .
The past malware kits developed , as the malware , consultation and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollar were bought .
“ Adjustment tools are contained in the scope of supply , so that smaller configurations , appearance and development of brands can be changed ” , say Wisniewski .
The blackmailers look for each other then further hackers , in order to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
We live in a service economy .
One logs oneself thus into one of the forums in the underground , buys the set of a criminal one and assigns a further to install the software on as much as possible PCs .
The payment takes place per infected computer .
“ Usually the criminal ones assign then spammer the spreading ” , explain Wisniewski .
The risk of Ransomware is meanwhile well-known with many enterprises , which secure their data better .
Over 50 percent trust the company IT responsible person in the malware byte survey to be able to repel Ransomware by means of file baking UPS and Scannersoftware .
Accordingly the perpetrators pursue already new strategies .
“ If the encoding of data alone no sufficient threat for successful Erpessung more is , threatens the perpetrators instead with the publication of sensitive data as for instance , malware byte boss of Marcin Kleczynski explains customer master lists or price estimations ” .
Thus the damage potential is higher depending upon kind of the data still around a multiple than before .
Also the perpetrators could take in the future completely new goals on the Internet the things on the grain .
To the conference of hacker Defcon demonstrated safety researchers , how they could get a connected thermostat with the Internet under their control .
In the middle in the winter de-energizing of an in such a manner blocked heating so some victim could quite be worth a ransom money .
If the perpetrators block a whole production line in a factory then instead of the heating in the future , Ransomware could become also in the industry 4,0 a topic .

Like most 6-year old Edmund Picciuto loves a singing , toys and naturally its mother .
But like the few its age comrades has Edmund Mikrozephalie , who result of a genetic disturbance , about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know anything during her pregnancy .
When he came the first time home , my first thought was not , I creates that .
I do not create that .
Whereupon I did not admit myself .
Which is not correct at all -- naturally one admitted on it , ” said themselves her .
And their it was communicated to its husband Vincent that Edmund will perhaps never recognize it to be able and that it will not possibly even survive .
Some physicians went even so far that they suggested institutionalizing him .
“ My first answer to it was not 'I knew that people make that still , ' ” explained Picciuto .
Edmund can run with the help of a going assistance .
Edmund could sit up to his third year of life neither nor crawl and he can yet speak .
But it makes progress slow .
It can run with support and bicyclings .
He loves it also to play and sing with its two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language , the Edmund for “ please sings itself to me somewhat forwards ” invented . ”
“ We teach sign language to him , ” told Picciuto CBS news .
But it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Edmund invented some indications alone .
Mikrozephalie has a variety at causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during the pregnancy .
The symptoms and prognoses can vary strongly .
It is to be said still too early , how infected it the life with the Zikavirus will affect .
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked , what will happened ?
What will happen ?
And it does not know it yet really .
I did not ask already for a long time no more for the prognosis , because I do not expect that she can really say someone to me .
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage , which was caused by the Zikavirus .
It becomes better .
They know that it will become better for you .
They will love your child and become your child you to love .

The depressing meal of the economic crisis in “ a plentiful meal ”
In March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the oval Office .
As a gourmet president Roosevelt had a weakness for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup .
Its menu on this day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding .
“ It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , ” said Jane Ziegelman .
Her husband Andrew Coe added , “ it was also a message to the Americans , like her to eat should . ”
The married couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and is both food historians .
Coes last book “ Chop Suey ” acted of the Chinese kitchen in the USA , while “ about the life in a house to the Lower East Side from the food perspective tells Ziegelman in its book 97 Orchard ” .
You newest co-operation , “ a decent meal ” , which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag , illustrate the history of the American kitchen during great depression .
They showed culinary solidarity , when them sand-yielded themselves with a reporter in the Eisenberg 's shop with dinner meet , a small , straightforward lunch in the Flatiron District , which is already since the stock market crash 1929 in the business .
Ziegelman , 54 , cream cheese-sand-yielded with olive bits , during Coe , turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ordered 57 ASS .
When the reporter ordered chopping roasts , this found the pair suitable for a discussion over the meal in the era of great depression .
“ Rich food was much likes ” , said Ziegelman .
There was peanut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap one , which stretches the ingredient .
Introduce yourselves to eat so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners .
Coe grinned .
“ It must have put in the stomach such as lead , ” said it .
In the years before great depression the table in an American household , particularly in rural areas , was a universe You CAN Eat Buffet .
Crews of women cooked for male agricultural labourers and it freshly baked pie for breakfast , for the lunch and dinners were served .
Were the Americans , who sent Europeans on during the First World War food being hungry . “ A Square Meal ” notes the ways , with which the country dealt with it , no more the paradise to be .
“ It was a time , in which meal for the Americans became a central , strained topic ” , begündete Coe , why it and its wife over it to write wanted .
The new budget diet was just as strained : Mysterious meals such as bread and casseroles became staple food , the casserole as “ wonderful kind of recycling leftovers ” marked Ziegelman , since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a kremigen sauce .
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying fruit .
Meat , which was for many years the center of the American kitchen , became a rarely served luxury .
Strange mixtures were tried out , since a calorie-rich and feedful satisfaction had priority before taste or even healthy understanding of kitchen .
During its search for the book , which covers also recipes , a court prepared Ziegelman baked bulbs with peanut butter from this epoch .
“ It was not a popular additive at the Mittagstsich , ” says Coe .
Brick man continues to implement : “ It was surreally . ”
Peanut butter and baked bulbs do not fit to each other .
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes .
Like never before or since then , household businesspeople - under it Louise Stanley , Leiterin federal office of the OF Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - propelled the eating habits of the country so .
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged to become women “ budgetary policy gutters ” to become fair and the challenge to transform Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
“ A Square Meal ” is a celebration of the historical delicacies .
In particular tastily the reports are being hungry over the answer of the government to those citizens , like president Herbert Hoovers letting me cake meal leaving .
While it praised publicly simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of its kitchen , he fed like the worth millions man of world , whom he became .
“ He liked continental kitchen such as fish with cucumber sauce , ” said Coe .
He ate in a nearly gilded dining-room and wore a tuxedo .
It was wonderful out of touch with reality .
Perhaps president Roosevelt would have committed the same error , if not his Mrs. Eleanor had requested him to set with his stomach an example .
As in the book descriptive hiring a lady housekeeper with no interest in flavors led by Mrs. Roosevelt to it that the white house brought the most boring meal out in Washington , but also one at the most hopeless prepared one . ”
Many of the kinds from the era of great depression of dealing with meal it was rejected , as soon as the country came the legs .
The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegelman , as well as whereupon , how science was applied to food .
The pair gave to have better understood on during the writing of the book the eating habits about Ziegelmans mother-in-law - for example like it food not to throw away could .
“ A genuine fear of the wasting of food had you , ” said Coe .
Ziegelman remembered : “ You made people actually suffer . ”
There there was the cream puff incident .
After the plates were cleared with Eisenberg 's , they and Coe pulled out a dessert , which they had at home prepared : the plum dessert , the president Roosevelt to noon ASS .
“ It is called Prune Whip , ” said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to give to modest recipes a fancy name .
There was no struck cream , only plums , something flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
Everyone immersed somewhat unwillingly a spoon into the tough , brown Glibber .
It did not taste surprisingly badly .
Coe got itself three times a consulting .
Like a CAN DO Budgetierer he said a few chopped walnuts to his wife , “ would help . ”

At the end of July drew it strong criticism on itself , when he meant , the Russians should Mrs. Clintons 's enamels chop , however he explained later “ natural meant I the sarcastic ” .
This method permits it to Mr. To shift and then as required back row Trump the linguistic borders in the policy .
“ I think , it am one of its methods to be tested , as certain messages are taken up by its fans , how they arrive , and then “ to get straight if necessary ” depending upon that , as the reaction fails . ” said Ruth Sherman , a Kommunikationsexpertin , which observes the language of both candidates .
In addition , I believe , he am more smartly enough around its statements enough to be held vaguely , so that they can be interpreted in different way .
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr has . Trump a still more corroding tone accepted , since its poll ratings continued to decrease .
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist , which was published on Friday , showed a guidance with large lead in the Federal States North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a neck-and-neck race in Florida .
During Mr. Generally tried not to have to apologize for its provocative expressions it accuses its critics of Trump frequently to distort its statements or to understand its humor wrongly .
But while it is located strengthened in the focus of the attention in the last months of its presidency campaign , Mr have . Trumps 's jokes its loyal fellow combatants into the incommodious situation brought , to it stand to have , independently of as provocatively its statements may also be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , former mayor of New York and of Trumps most prominent advocates , gave himself to defend large trouble the candidate today in an CNN interview from Thursday to .
“ I believe , what he says is legitimate , political comments ” said Mr. Giuliani thus it to the correctness of Mr. Trumps 's statements it was asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton the Islamic state would have created .
It is in this sense truely that before Obama ISIS a nearly unknown , small organization was , he called her backbenchers , perfectly wrongly and therefore happened it , because it withdrew the troops from Iraq .
Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government among Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as a Foreign Minister served , it ISIS permitted , to spread as it omitted bringing the situation in the Near East aggressively under control .
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr set . Trump its attacks on the media away and accused to them to harp on on each of its words and be partial against him .
He did not lampoon the “ poor , deplorable ” television experts , who try him to understand and said , “ you can it ! ” .
Some of the democrats scoffed at Mr. Trumps 's apology as only a further proof that it is unsuitable for the presidential office .

There are many things to consider , since this property will be probably viewed as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls .
The family is notorious and their call is it likewise .
The pair had three sons , who lived in the meantime in the apartment and which police said that the terror , which had added the family covered street fights with baseball bats , intimidating adjacents resident , drug abuse , drug trade and excessive crying , controversies and swearing .
Skeldon , 47 , its name on the lease was located , received in June an arrangement for anti-social behavior .
In some areas of the house , which will be perhaps torn off , old garbage was found
In the property , in which in the past drugs were acted , the timber floor boards were broken
Neighbours stated that they saw fighting them on the road and regularly the police to be called had

On the side of the community center over-rampantly grown garbage and old toys were thrown down
It added : “ It is a dishonor that it neglected the tenant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that their family since a Delogierung is always the last step , which considers Cornwall housing .
That was a very difficult case , since the behavior was extreme and their acts for their neighbours had to be terrible to watch .
I estimate all the work , those my team , the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community , which went courageously toward us and the information has us to send to have , carried out .
I hope that this development will donate and the message to some neighbours comfort mediated that anti-social behavior is not tolerated .

A dirty mattress , those left in one the bedrooms of the house after the Delogierung on the ground wirde
Workers of the housing management will have to clear now garbage mountains , the house will surround

Constantly in the name of the fight against terror at laws one screws .
After the recent attacks Minister of the Interior de Maizière submits now a thick safety package .
But which has a tolerance status with terror to do ?
And which says the coalition partner to all that ?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Versöhner .
All its proposals are “ politically reasonable ” the coalition partner , say the Federal Minister of the Interior with the conception of its new safety package .
They do not make excessive demands of anybody .
Others , large points were discussed first within the parties .
Also to it I take part .
As a Minister of the Interior is however at results been to it and because of a “ attainable consent ” within the coalition .
De Maizière let little time elapse after the recent attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach , before he presents his conclusions for security in the republic .
Fail for it now however all the more extensively .
Some is already well-known , announced , focused : The fact that a new security authority is to worry about cracking coded communication is not new .
Also not the fact that Germany must convert several European Union-defaults to aircraft passenger data and gun law .
The call to more closed circuit television and staff for the security authorities does not come just as surprisingly .
Partially de Maizière starts a second approach for proposals , which were not to be made with the SPD so far : It wants sympathy advertisement for terrorist groups under punishment to place and to jihadists with double nationality the German passport unbutton .
“ That difficult points will be for the SPD ” , grant the CDU man .
It hold this nevertheless for reasonable and demand also nothing that has no opportunities at the coalition partner anyway .
De Maizière presents a few new ideas also .
Those have it partly in itself : It plans shortened proceedings for deportation and more possibilities for the arrest of humans before the deportation .
Refugees , who are gotten purposefully in the country , are to let their smartphones check before and Social Media accounts for a security examination to reveal .
With tolerances for rejected asylum seekers it wants to place some still more badly than so far - for instance such , which commit criminal offences or throw their papers away consciously , in order to mask their identity .
Some of it is politically and legally delicate .
Some works also still ill-considered and leaves questions open .
And at some points - with the discrimination of waited one for example - the question arises : What has to do actually with security and terror ?
Yes , de Maizière , says is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror .
But it can not be placed in agreement that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees .
In addition many humans worryd themselves in view of the high refugee numbers around security .
And things , which employed humans deeply , did not let themselves exclude just also in election campaign times .
Internal security moved enormously into the focus .
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach .
The disconcertion is large .
And yes , election campaigns line up .
Union and SPD position themselves with the topic internal security from there increasingly .
In the past days it worked between the two parties highly .
Only a mean controversy over the equipment of the Federal Police , then over a security-political idea collection of some union Ministers of the Interior , in which the department heads demand also a Burka prohibition and a break with the double nationality .
De Maizière strives itself also here around conciliatory tones .
From a break with the double passport do not think it anything .
We pacified the discussion in Germany .
It to open again , is not meaningful .
And with a Burka prohibition it has constitutional doubts .
Whether its own package at all corners is verfassungsfest and whether it is actually “ reasonable ” for the coalition partner , must itself only still show .
It puts some in it , which could provide for controversy .
But also the SPD tries at present to form itself with the topic internal security .
Party chief Sigmar Gabriel signaled only times carefully willingness to have talks and says : “ the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to it , security further to increase ” .

It is a marvelous mixture , the perfect the recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have amber music really in our blood !
In this production Bartoli plays older Maria become .
It remembers with nostalgia its affair with Tony , while younger Maria plays and dances .
The role Maria always fascinated me .
First of all because it is in music unusual !
And then there still Marias would be personality .
She says it in her song : “ I feel pretty , oh pretty , I feel pretty and witty and bright in such a way ” .
It is thus intelligently , naturally also naively , and very passionately .
“ Resembles you me much , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman ” , laugh Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of the praise for the opera singer : “ Cecilia is a marvelous artist . ”
It is to be worked so an honour for us with it .
She is tremendously generous humans .
And Bartoli returns the radix complement : “ Dudamel is very passionate such an unusual artist and ! ”
Directs is for it a necessity .
One sees it in everyone its movements , in its views , it is its life !
It is to be able to divide so an enormous opportunity this musical experience with it .
We have both a rather southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a merry approach to the life , that are at all very important !
For the American director Philip Wm . McKinley is topical the “ west Side story ” : “ In this piece it concerns prejudices and fanaticism . ”
Today we have the refugees , at that time the Puertorikaner to New York went , and the New Yorker inhabitants did not want them .
There is the same topics , and they are today just as meaningful as at that time .

Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue at the dirtiest places of Europe for a travel guide
A British traveler submitted its immune system and choking reflex of a serious examination - by licking some the dirtiest and most disgusting places of Europe .
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk scraped its course on a euro-light , a railing at the Piccadilly Circus , a rinsing button of a course toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia , in order to prove the ruggedness of its immune system .
Before licking each object it used a Luminometer , in order to appear and us , in which it will get involved .
But the experiment , which was filmed under the title “ The Lickhiker 's Guide ton internal Strength ” , brought some surprising results to the daylight .
The thought to lick the rinsing button of a course toilet which already by thousands of others one used , may be completely repulsive , but more bad bacteria actually are in a kitchen rinse .
On his travel by Europe Mr. Wright with physicians and medical specialists spoke about the promotion of intestine bacteria as well as about his own health .
Fortunately nothing that he licked , left more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became admits to test the ruggedness of its intestine by traveling by the world and strange as well as wonderful things ASS .
From public railings at stations up to rinsing buttons of toilets , the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample
In the film it told : “ As a child I was relatively unconcerned already , which concerns my health and I have all possible things put into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . ”
In the film it became in any case fair its call .
The only one which it rejected , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
Its sample reduction showed a Luminometerzahl from over 4000 units .
In the comparison to it the Luminometerzahl of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
But there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick , after their Luminometerzahl over 4000 units amounted to , while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film “ The Lickhiker 's Guide ton internal Strength ” , which shows the bacteria number at different places like the bathroom
In the film he says : “ Approximates the worst one , which I smelled in a toilet . ”
There is nothing dirtier than that !
I will lick here nothing , because it is disgusting here inside .
“ The Lickhiker 's Guide ton internal Strength ” was produced in co-operation with the Finnish manufacturer by milk products Valio .
The enterprise equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus , which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D , in order to support the promotion of intestine bacteria and the immune system .
Valios senior Venice President for snack , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : “ We wanted to really offer something new to the consumers .
Something , which is fascinating for looking at and at the same time the advantages by Probiotika explained .
We accomplished moved brainstorming , which ended with the fact that we said “ let us leave us Ian to call . ”
They maintain that the interest in intestine health becomes a global phenomenon
In place of only about the products to talk , we wanted to place them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of the intestine health and like it is linked with the immune system .
The increasing interest in the intestine health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film could we to the consumers available over it more information in an interesting way make .
I think also that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hakala , which led the direction of the film , added : “ Leaving it me to say in such a way - I would have mean respect for Ian lost , if he had licked some the things , I it instructed to lick , as the disgusting Russian toilet , those in the film am shown . ”
Naturally there were things to bring with which it was simpler , Ian to it to lick and others , with which this was rather difficult .
I am glad that we took up some these dirty treats on film . ”
In a survey accomplished by Valio from the year 2015 it associated 84 percent of all asked lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent stated that they use at least occasionally products , which contain attached lactic acid bacteria .

It browsed to far and tried four pair pants in a business in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone , on .
The Primark business in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone , in which the woman tried on the pants , before she put her back into the shelf
A mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , whom at the same time in the business it was said that after the mysterious woman had tried on the underwear , “ her again dressed and the business left without something to buy . ”
She said : “ The people could not believe , what they saw . ”
In the middle standing on the sales area it took a pair pants from the display , took her own thights and trousers off and tried on it .
“ You did not even try a something to diskreteren place to find , in order to do it - it stood simply there , impudently like Oskar . ”

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning by fight with the cancer of the coach to the rudder victory inspire
It no emotinaleres gold as with these plays will give and that wants which is called .
There from the first stroke to last , 220 hard heave , which enter history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at the Estacio to Lagoa .
Even if only the two were , which sat at the rudder , there were three voices in the boat . The echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all-present as it to the second olympia gold in two without tax woman in consequence rowed , the first women in the history of the British sport , which put such a standard .
Their dominance was absolutely , nevertheless its 39.ter unbeaten employment , which is likewise unprecedented .
Which we see are two brilliante athletes , who slide over the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not reflect the kind of the triumph to entirety .
Behind each gold in rowing a battalion does not put those for on willing aides , that contribute to the incremental progress , the difference constitutes and it was more helpful anybody than the coach , who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all , when with him cancer was diagnosed .
As he said , he which riskily .
I had bladder cancer , that am operatable and did her .
If you do not do that , he spreads everywhere .
It would have been rather bad situation .
It changes a little the view .
William one made a diagnosis in December 2013 .
The trio had luck that it were treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside of which season could begin , which held the interruption a minimum , if under such circumstances at all the correct term is .
I needed money , therefore I had to be soon again better .
It was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 foot , 30 foot , 50 foot at a time , when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
Thus it begins .
Rowing actually is already a challenge , but it makes a still more larger .
In the immediacy of the victory went their first thoughts to William , who spent a nerve-racking morning thereby somewhat more than otherwise to talk and thus tried to process its own fears .
Stanning , which was as a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in use in Afghanistan , said “ I was this week an emotional wreck . That is perhaps somewhat extreme , but it means so much . ”
It repeats only , how much me that means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
Were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
Without Robin we would not be anybody , therefore goes a massif thanks to it . He is a best coach of the world .
I could myself have wished no better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no running in the last five years .
The pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
Even in the last 500 meters , as the teams from New Zealand and Denmark , had Stanning and Glover began to unlock too much in reserve .
We were very for the moment imprisoned .
Helen called “ remains in the process , remains in the process ” .
It is really important not to be able to be drug along .
We had a good start and at the same time were we not out to make something great .
We wanted today no fireworks , we wanted simply a good result to obtain , go out and a running to win , which we also did .
The pair will take itself for one year a time-out , before it will make decisions over its future .
Glover must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall .
Now it wants to enjoy simply the moment .
I did not want to say that my last running was .
That would have meant too much pressure .
In London it took approximately six months , in order to understand that I am an olympia winner .
It was everything so again for me and I was in such a way stressed .
Here it took approx . four minutes .
That feels so much better , ” said it .

Who builds of Braunschweig favorable apartments ?
The SPD and the Green mean : Investors are to be taken in the future much more strongly into the obligation .
How does one react to the bad message that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 favorable apartments in the next years ?
The SPD suggests a “ action concept living ” for next council meeting .
But controversy is programmed .
Primarily it concerns the question : Who is to actually build the favorable apartments ?
A regulation is missing so far .
SPD faction leader Christoph Bratmann means : “ We are us with the Greens united : Who wants to build on urban surfaces , in the future 20 percent of all apartments than subsidized low-rent housings must prove . ”
The favorable apartments can develop however also in the existence .
The large point at issue in the city hall is however , like that roasting man : “ As one deals with investors , those on private surfaces to build wants ? ”
“ We want that investors on such surfaces build at least 10 percent , but as 20 a percent of the apartments as possible as subsidized low-rent housings . ”
A new urban housebuilding advancement program , which will cost millions and still must be financed , is to provide for incentives .
The problem , so roasting man : “ There is momentarily still no agreement between the parliamentary groups . ”
The CDU would like to make if possible few regulations for investors .
The left one wants still hardens editions for investors .
Regardless of its , so roasting man , is at hand an aggravation of the situation on the housing market .
If the action concept is converted , for additional tasks in the building authorities will provide .
More staff one needs .
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
Still the program does not stand completely : Because those approximately 1260 new apartments , which should anyway are built .
How however does one adjust the loss of further approximately 1300 favorable apartments , whose promotion will run out in the next years ?
However up to the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
In order to prevent , so the planning-political spokeswoman Nicole Palm , connections of the city , running out now , should be purchased .
In addition would have to be thought to get apartments again back into the application of fixed prices .
That is possible in Weststadt .
At one blow the problem would let itself solve .
Because run out in Weststadt to the end of the year eking out .
One could get approximately 1800 apartments there back into the application of fixed prices for favorable apartments .
Only : The owners , housing associations do not want that .
Because the number of the subsidized low-rent housings in Weststadt is increased again drastically , departs one from the goal of the so-called mixing .
A concentration of socialweak in only few quarters is not to give it any longer .
The Greens count on the fact that it will give still movement in the discussion .
Leader of the parliamentary group Holger Herlitschke means : “ For a broad majority the CDU must also in the boat . ”
Those concentrated on more building sites for single family houses .
Which however it does not mean that still another compromise can not be found .

Greenland shark : The oldest vertebrate animal is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight .
Greenland sharks come usually only in the winter to the surface .
This shark was allowed after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna in the sea back .
It was born 1624 and swims with well 1 km/h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland sharks get only with 150 years new generation .
Leisurely the Greenland shark swims at the reason of the North Atlantic along , in one hour comes it on the average straight 1,220 meters far .
Only if it depends on it , accelerated that five meters long animal on full 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast with this maximum speed as a seal .
This lifestyle coined by tardiness seems to be however a ready-made solution for a great age .
Julius Nielsen of the university of Copenhagen and its colleagues anyhow report in the technical periodical “ Science ” of a Greenland shark , which could be 392 years old .
“ Insanity ” , commentates Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span , which means a world record for vertebrate animals .
The evolution biologist assumed for a long time that Greenland sharks become aged .
The proofs were only missing .
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe , finally live them particularly in the polar sea before the thinly settled coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitzbergen .
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they emerge at the surface usually only in the winter .
About the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks researchers know according to few .
They measured their slow-motion , when they equipped six animals before Spitzbergen with a transmitter .
These sharks make booty nevertheless : In the stomach of an animal researcher found the remnants of a seal , another the jaw bone of a young polar bear had swallowed .
Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the reason of the polar sea and look for carcasses , which stagger downward from higher water layers .
Julius Nielsen and its colleagues examined now 28 Greenland sharks , which got Fischer between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as by-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
The smallest shark was straight 81 centimeters long , while measured largest 502 centimeters .
In order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the Kohlenstoff-14-Methode .
This center of the eyepiece develops already before the birth of the sharks , which become therein contained proteins later no more renewed .
The two smallest sharks had remarkably much Kohlenstoff-14 in the lens core .
Their birth should lie from there after the early 1960er years , when nuclear tests hurled larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
In the animal third-smallest with 220 centimeters length contained the lens core against it a small surplus of Kohlenstoff-14 from the nuclear tests , it might when its investigation in the year 2012 thus its 50 . Birthday celebrated .
All larger Greenland sharks had normal Kohlenstoff-14-Mengen , which results from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere in their lens core against it .
The Kohlenstoff-14-Uhr for a 493 centimeter actually showed long Greenland shark an age of 335 years , while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be even 392 years old .
The fact that Greenland shark females get only then new generation if they are longer than four meters , was well-known .
Now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to sexual maturity and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland sharks with increase leave themselves obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
Also that might be for vertebrate animals world record at present .
That such Methuselahs live particularly in icy waters , is no coincidence .
Also the past record holder , a 211 years old bowhead whale , into whose bacon at the neck 120 years an old harpoon point was , became imprisoned before Alaska .
By the low temperatures frequently also the organism of the there living animals runs on low flame .
They mature thus later - and age more slowly .
In order to keep itself warm in the cold water , the animals become besides often particularly largely .
Because the volume grows many faster than its surface , by which the animal loses warmth .
The calorific loss of a gram of mouse is much larger from there than with a gram elephant .
A further advantage : They have less enemy .
“ A smaller animal lives thus more dangerously and should concentrate as early as possible as many as possible descendant to have ” , explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein .
A very large animal should invest against it its resources rather into a long life .

Queensferry Crossing : Bridge now connected with Fife
£ 1.35 billion the expensive project are to be finished until May 2017
Engineers connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is connected with Fife now .
It is first of four locking the “ cover blowers ” , which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge .
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
It has 10.000 tons steel and 20,000 tons concrete as well as 46 inclined cables .
£ 1.35 billion the expensive project are to be finished until May 2017 .
Minister of economics Keith Brown paid the building site today a visit and was one first , who went from the country on the bridge .
He said : “ That is a historical and symbolic moment with the building of the Queensferry Crossings .
We are all witnesses of an engineer art of a indeed epic measure with this project also over 30.000 tons concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
Despite the substantial size and weight the bridge , is the completion of the catch between the viaduct and the bridge deck a delicate activity , which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
Altogether nearly 79 % of the entire bridge deck at their place and the last section of the deck are receive today in Rosyth a concrete casting for the deck , which meant that the entire deck is ready , on the bridge to its place to be lifted .
Michael Martin , Projektleiter von Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : “ The first catch represents a substantial milestone with each bridge project .
With this fantastic project the catch represents to trend-setting high and foundation engineering .
After the installation of the last road cover section and its connection with the north tower deck in the development , we had to then close the still existing gap on the north or land side .
This was south reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge of 700 millimeters .
This was a substantial and at the same time very delicate activity .
Substantial one , since that is 222 meters long viaduct , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had with an increase of approx . 3 % to be pulled upward .
Delicately , since the tolerances , on which the team works towards , were tiny - on each side they amounted to only some millimeters .
Fortunately everything ran very well .

Say supported troops of the USA that they reconquered again complete control of Manbij of the Islamic state
Troops supported by the USA have complete control of the northern city Manbij the close Turkish border reconquered , after the last IS-fighters in the city left these , said a spokesman of the group on Friday .
The democratic forces of Syria ( DKS ) comb the city after the excerpt of the group of fighters , still remained , who buried themselves within the city , at present .
They have Darwish of the Manbij of military advice Reuters allied with the DKS over 2.000 civilians released , who were thought of the fighters as hostages , communicated crowd fan .
“ The city now is under perfect control , but we would drive through straight clean-up operations , ” told it Reuters .

Kepler does without rotation rate of stars in the heap of star of the pleiads
The newest mission with the Kepler space telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog at rotation rates under the stars of the heap of star of the pleiads .
The new data help to understand the astronomers , as well as why stars in the heap of star rotate themselves to different rates in which connection the rotation periods with the planet emergence .
“ We hope that we experience more by comparing our results with other heaps of star , over the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , ” said Luisa Rebull , a researcher at the Caltech 's Infrared processing and analysis center in Pasadena , in a press release .
The heap of star of the pleiads lies 445 light-years remotely from the earth .
Many stars in this heap of star , which originated in approximately 125 million years ago , reach now the adult age .
They turn now fastest .
To point rotation rates these maturing stars discharge large quantities of star hoists .
Since this hoist by the magnetic fields of the stars travel , they have a braking effect on the stars .
If a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler does without the rotation rate of each star , by he the time between the appearance of a recognizable star mark -- like sunspots -- recognizes .
The newest catalog of rotation rates points out that more solid stars turn more slowly than less solid stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , whereby larger stars of slow pirouettes turn as smaller .
“ In “ clench ” the pleiads see we that slow rotors tend to be more substantial whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright of stars ” said to Rebull .
Since the heap of star of the pleiads is so close , it serves as ideal cosmic laboratory , in order to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
“ The heap of star of the pleiads offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , ” said Rebull .
It lies still much before us about what we gladly to learn more wants , how how , when and why stars slow their rotation rates down and hang their “ dancing pumps up ” as it were .
Rebull and their colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports on its newest analysis of the rotation rates of the pleiads , which will appear soon in the Astronomical journal .
