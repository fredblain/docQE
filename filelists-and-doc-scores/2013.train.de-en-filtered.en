I have had from Oxford mobbed Petronella Wyatt , because I am a Tory
Not only university students are attacked today for their views
The very it was always been extremely my dream to be given a place in the Oxford University .
Both my father and I visited the University of older brother , I once for the largest Wissenstempel the world , for a modern Greek symposium , which facilitated the great pillars of civilisation - free - thinking and tolerance .
However , in the space of two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College the end of the 1980s , I was there to study history - I had intended to put my suitcases and again as the first scandal about my life .
My father , collapsed in tears .
My friends were confused .
In the Evening Standard , I would have said , because I had a problem with continental colleagues that in neighbouring room sex would have had .
The writer A schelmisch N Wilson said , I would have left the University of damaged cups because I was forced to drink .
The truth is that there has been less amusing .
It ran away .
Yes , because I was systematischem suffered harassment and threats .
It is not about because of my name or rather unusual , because I was a Privatschule .
We had , harassed for one reason only reason why in this supposed cradle of narrow - minded and cruel seemed so now : my late father was an important Woodrow Wyatt of Margaret Thatcher and I have been in favour of the Conservative Party .
Why do I mention this now ?
Now , according to recent reports of a new generation of students is suffering of the moderate rights under similar persecution .
The organised and growing hatred on Tory-Studenten has now developed in Oxford such dimensions that a group of them last week , the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz , gay , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
Conservative Members of the junior common rooms ( JCR ) of the corpus of Christ College to be active in isolation , they are often due to their political views ' personal attack , and says ' undesirable .
you are calling for a place in the Gleichberechtigungskomitee of the College , in order to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely .
Verschlimmert their situation by a recent article watch on political students on BBC Two , `` Wonderland : Young Bright , and on the Right , was the Tories as eccentrics and neo - Nazis .
That has been shown , among other things , to graduate from Joe Cooke , former President of the conservative student Association of Oxford University in a continued fear and with silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock protzte .
An other universities say conservative students , they are seen as a `` scapegoats for the introduction of higher fees ' .
The 20 - year - old Luke black , Vice - President of the conservative Studentenvereinigung the University of Nottingham , has stated in a Sunday newspaper : ' There is a growing Linkstendenz universities .
The people believe that we are as the Bullingdon club , without even come to us ' .
Bishop Samuel Roberts , 21 and Geschichtsstudent in corpus of Christ , who initiated the request for greater protection , is of the opinion that such a climate . The 'inconvenient ' 19-j - year - old Stephanie Cherill designated President , the conservative student unification of Oxford says that we have observed in JCR-Mitgliedern a growing opposition to students of the moderate rights .
'This is a threat to the intellectual debate and for the well - being of its members , it says ' .
In my first weeks in Oxford I was in a minority .
As an unbelievably timid -18 year olds in September I was reached in 1986 .
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak .
In the last year the university voted in favour , to give Mrs Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education no title of honour .
The atmosphere I would even Stalinists squirm .
In the early days of Erstsemester-Woche , in the new students Tutoren to get to know each other , and I had a foretaste of what is happening in the future .
I drew to the experience that the Tutoren the mockery of Tory-Studenten duldeten not only , but also happily take part .
Political issues such as the Bergarbeiterstreik , privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa have found their way into the holzgetäfelten Tutoriums of areas .
During my first of these events , I should in the 18th century French texts translated into English . At what should then , I had not been taken .
'Miss Wyatt the tutor said ' Harry Pitt ( have passed 'booths , you ask the first paragraph .
I , I came here .
Pitt was a small man with a human face , and as from Kuchenteig rather be horrendous .
'Thatcher-Anh Weigern to learn , French , or are they just stupid ? ' , he asked me .
The other students kicherten .
In my eyes , tears wallten on .
'I propose that they take a few Französischstunden in your leisure , so , if you are not very much to your social activities are of concern to me , Pitt knurrte ' .
I came back with hängendem capita in my room .
This evening , I was having dinner alone in the College , as somebody tippte easy on the back .
It was a Englischstudent from the second year of James who , as a member of the Conservative student Association presented .
`` I know that you know , he said 'kind .
Unfortunately , it is how it is .
Anyone who is suspected of Tory to be harassed .
For me it is bad enough , but you know that your father , Margaret Thatcher , therefore , is for you , it will be worse .
The majority , to be giving Tory-Erstsemester , supporters of the Labour Party .
In a local pubs , I tried to later .
I insisted that I do not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher .
This device should prove to be a failure .
An Studienanfänger on political and economic philosophy which , ironically , this is a conservative Eton visited the College , said to me : `` You are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins ' .
being polluted .
Other students share his opinion .
I was dreckig and perverse .
'As Tories have sex ? `` asked of me .
The propose , or each other ?
I felt , such as homosexuals in the more liberal legislation of the United States have had to have felt .
I have ever , be it at the University of Oxford to lead a normal life ?
dignity Gleichgesinnte I can only go out after ?
Should the Labour Party , and I turn to my natural inclination to suppress it ?
The three years , which had reached before me , before my intellectual eye to purgatory of the ban and isolation .
The only tutor , which were open to a Tory , Norman Stone , Professor for contemporary history , which has its seat in the College .
He was not only for this to be a Conservative Steel Community , but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy , for it was written speeches and consult .
He was only rarely .
He was the place where it hated parochial and small , and it is his marxistisch-deterministische Geschichtsperspektive .
1997 was in my professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey .
'You will not be happy , he said to me ' .
I began to travel between Oxford and the House , my parents and seek refuge in open friends and relatives in the city .
Meinem father I told that I hated Oxford and why I did so .
He seemed disbelief .
During his time in the Vierzigern all political views were accepted .
`` But it is the best place in the world ' , he said meekly .
That is something they would never do not , in my city of träumenden Turmspitzen .
Even my communist friends , always good manners .
His wet which marred eyes .
Give the whole , a chance .
I am sure that you only neckt .
It would be my heart to break gingst if you .
Erschöpft by my frequent visits to London my emotional reaction was weaker .
One of my male friends Tory-Anh too , had given in to the pressure and renounce his convictions .
During a Tutoriums the following week , a further serious Geschichtstutor had claimed that I was `` an enemy of the people , I decided to do the same .
Although I head in shame zerging secret , I have been subjected to me that my parents ' brainwashing 'and they were called ' old 'aiming .
The facilitation of lasted only briefly .
It was my father , the proposed the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford-Karriere .
At that time , he wrote per week in the Murdoch press two columns .
My door was closed .
I hidden , in this room , and after five minutes at my Häscher .
When they , I received a suitcase packte and adopted the first train to London .
I never come back .
I am happy to give you a weinerlichen Schlappschwanz .
But no 18 - year - old should ever at a school in such intimidation and to malice .
And even more tragic that it was an Oxford University , which had only 14 Tory-Premierminister , but not far behind a windfall reputation of equality and freedom of thought hidden .

The Higgs-Boson analysed
The announcement of the discovery of the probable Higgs-Bosons has aroused last summer a certain , and for good reason .
We believe , in fact , that this Boson nothing for the majority of all the issues in the universe , less than the mechanism is involved
And finally , this is the last of the particles , whose existence of the standard model , our best or the least 'wrong ' explanation of nature and the behaviour of the matter , empirically , but still not been observed .
But for the physicist it is still not entirely sure that it is really the Higgs .
We know , without a shadow of a doubt that we have a genuine new particles and that the predicted by the standard model Higgs-Boson very similar .
I also believe this to be confirmed by the new data in this week on a major Physik-Kongress were presented in Kyoto , but there is still a lack of data , in order to be completely safe .
from walking , we nevertheless , that this is indeed the Higgs , because apparently only a low level of risk , and what we are looking to us .
There is in this world a crucial law , which inevitably means that two objects the same place at the same time not able to be present .
It is not possible to keep to this rule - and you are not too much , because you will try to hurt .
Because even if the particle physics one world really odd that , for them , also proposed such a law , which states : Ausschlussprinzip Pauli is true that two particles not fill the same place at the same time , when they are in the same 'Quantenzustand ' , and the 'state ' by and large there is for some of their characteristics .
Davon the share a physicist the particles into two categories .
In a corner , the good of the citizens , be described as Fermione and lastly the Pauli-Prinzip .
And on the other , the Bosonen a nasty gang of anarchists nothing sacred , which is in any case not of this principle , which means that they are in fact the same place at the same time can .
This divide Bosonen on the website The Particle Adventure of the laboratories Berkeley ( which , incidentally , is absolutely remarkable ) into two groups : the Mesonen we are not to be treated and the 'Kraftteilchen ' by the spread and the major forces of nature with Higgs-Boson in a way which would be used .
It must be stressed , however , that these Bosonen not all such as it could be exotic are creatures .
If you are able to read this story , then , just a mediocre Bosons of exceptional : the Photon Lichtteilchen 'or ' the `` is ' boats the electromagnetic force .
If that is an unimportant or accelerated change in the direction of an electrical goods ' the electromagnetic fields is disturbed precisely in this place , such as ' in a pebble , who was thrown into a pond where .
Indeed , these `` disturbance `` ( an electromagnetic waves , infrared light or Ultraviolettstrahlung , etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a Photon Bosonen and therefore one of the `` bearer of force ' .
Stabileres field
the same goes for the Higgs-Boson , with the difference that another area that Higgs-Feld 'must ' be disrupted , so that this Boson .
But Higgs-Feld which is much more stable than the electromagnetic fields ; the pathogen should achieve very high energy , a bit like a frozen pond where its functions only by a very large rocks zerfurcht could be .
And it is a huge Teilchenbeschleuniger like CERN necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km , in order to achieve this type of energy .
The analogy with the electromagnetic fields is helpful to explain once again , the relationship between the Higgs and the mass .
It has not , in fact , all the particles are and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic fields .
Some , such as magnets , do this , but others do not , for example , would never be a piece of paper in the refrigerator .
And just as not all of the particles interact with the Higgs-Feld : those who do it , have a majority , while the other ( like the Photon ) have no mass .
For what all these research can now be 'good ' woman wondering Plamondon ?
For it is the science of the review of the standard passenger data model ( SM ) , and they allow the Physikern also to examine all the differences between the observations and the predictions of SM .
There are also numerous physicist , the hope that , since such exceptions are the slightest difference and plug open a door to a new 'physics some gaps , the model .
You must say that the latter still major deficiencies , because it offers no explanation for the gravity - ups ( ! ) and of the dark ca . issue that 80 % of the subject matter of the universe ! ) ( once again - ups .
But not in CERN such derogations have been found by now .
impact
The effects of this research for the general population are difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there were no .
main issues here have thought : are the pioneers of Lasers in the Bell-Laboren that their work in the early 1960s would give rise to such a revolution .
you saw scientific applications , but nothing else .
In fact , we have invented the late physicist Boyle Willard has already said - in the Bell Sail Labs complex has worked in which the lasers in the 1960s , which has been developed since 1962 and even the first Dauerstrichlaser ( the first gepulst ) has been - that the lasers , at the beginning , rather than an 'Laborspielerei was considered .
posts before you ...
can also be applications but also for all the instruments that surrounded the research .

Although it is not the original purpose of this carrier was all digital cameras today throughout the world as the 'eye ' and has brought him the Nobel Prize for 2009 physics .
Of course , this does not mean that the activities of our life LHC necessarily change but it does mean that we really know it can never ...

Israel : laboratory of the chaos .
... '' that nothing is ever from violence or Sting scale could be created in the 'Fragile song : ' refrain , of which the most important is : ... '' so that we do not forget that we are ' how fragile .
'When my sons was no war , it did not say ' the dying Gutele Schnaper , wife of Mr Mayer , in the year in 1849 Amschel Rothschild
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza , as always , a huge number of responses .
The one behind Israel and argue with the right to self - defence , while they describe as the Palestinian terrorists help the Palestinians ; others argue with the racism of the Israeli State , with the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs and call the 'state of Israel .
I would like to take this opportunity to write about who is not in the successive waves of killing is guilty and who is ultimately the victims ; today 's inhabitants were born of Israel , including the Selbstverwaltungsgebiete in the current political situation and have seen the start of the violence .
It is about to open the readers look behind the scenes , who look forward to 95 years ( from the Balfour declaration in November in 1917 ) in the small area of the country in the Middle East , above all , help .
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts that are derived from these and other states are from my own understanding of who the group of people or significantly influence the events of modern history .
The history of the human race is primarily a history of the struggle for power .
In every era , we can detect a Alexander the Great or Napoleon .
What is less obvious , the question is whether we really are those who , even independently of their action , or whether someone behind their throne , which was its actions to a vorbestimmtes objective .
We must accept that we live in a time in which the wealth of the planet is concentrated in the hands of fewer of individuals , and that this concentration of the currency and the resultant power Lebensspanne not within a generation has been created .
In the astronomical is a very rich families , which we could describe as the head of the moreover ( I do not know whether I have on them from someone who is not , however , agree with this - the Rothschilds .
For not it is written on .
understandably enough .
The first ( Reuters news agency ) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 1990s , the 19th century , in order to prevent the link with their name hochkriminellen action in the context of the consolidation of their powers , the reproduction of their assets , or both .
The Rothschilds involved in almost all the central banks in the world and to the countries in which they are not in the central banks are involved , they lead to wars or are these ( before the attack on Afghanistan , there were seven countries , following the attack on Iraq , there were 5 countries after the overthrow Ghaddafis only have four with Russia , in the meantime , to the Russian Government has its Central Bank .
Who has always tried to this family , has had to pay with their lives for this .
Abraham Lincoln from refusing to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a Central Bank , started during the civil war , own ( in other words , state ) notes to 1865 and was murdered in a theatre .
J.F . Kennedy began to produce their own banknotes , and wanted to abolish the Fed , he was murdered in 1963 , the honourable Member Mr McCarthy 1936 Fadden poisoned , having been the Fed sue for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929 .
The global appetite for power over the years the Rothschilds 1859 - led it to the drafting of a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik , one of the 33rd pertaining to the highest level .
The first war was intended to remove the great monarchistischen Staatenwesen of Europe , by the second war in particular should be broken , the British colonial war , and the third is to reduce the world 's population to be around 0.5 - 1 billion people - would provide such a number of their benefits and its luxury and would also do not consume so many resources ( a ) , create Universalreligion of ecumenism here is nothing more than the advance ) and , finally , for the adoption of the absolute power .
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top , triggering is a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution - order chao ( order from the chaos ) .
These solutions are wrong and repeating again lead to the deterioration of the situation ( see the Federal Reserve , so that crises like the one of them was in 1907 not ) .
Having destroyed it the first Russian trigger the Russian Empire World War by them , the revolution of the Bolsheviks and murder Habsburg Thronfolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo was managed
The First World War ended with the sudden , military and economically unfounded Germany 's capitulation ( for the destruction of the Russian Zarenreiches the war was not necessary ) , following the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria - Hungary .
In the Second World War on easier to be able to create the bankers , the policy of a latent conflict in Germany , whereas with gigantic Kriegsreparationen ; in so doing , they have created a condition of the impoverished masses so that they just the Germans unterjubeln a sufficiently strong leader of the guilty parties notified and offered simple solutions , and the creation of further a factor was the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who play the role of a fifth column should be respected , and also in order to provoke the Kriegsbrand had to .
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds took the initiative in setting up the Zionist movement of a sector that is , the creation of a Judenstaates who , as far as possible on the historic area Judäas with Jerusalem as the capital ( return to Sion ) .
The Balfour declaration , as has already been mentioned , the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine ; it was first clashes with the local Arab population .
Terroristische there have been attacks on both sides .
The Second World War , and now whether the international bankers by Hitler the chain , only ran to the difficult to keep at it , is in any case the suffering or whether it was established according to plan , of European Jews in the concentration camps , the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community .
Israel was founded , and in 1948 , as well as through Kriegsreparationen against Germany the ground for the Second World War , has been the creation of the State of Israel is the creation of the Brennpunktes for the Third World War .
If it that the Jewish people will unleash war similar in the Second World War , the victims of international bankers can be in the front , Kampflinie , this time with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of the dispute and the chaos , not only in the country itself , but also internationally ( just think how strongly the people of Israel 's main supporters and opponents .
Anyone who is and who is guilty of the victims in the conflict between Palestinians and Israeliten only where injustice is wrong in an endless cycle of violence , and the starting point is the greed and their quest for a global power ?
We must make a distinction between the peoples of Israel and its leadership , but the international bankers in Israel , as well as for us , the people , only their own candidates for election .
The current Israeli Prime Minister , Mr Netanyahu , the Falke , a typical example is a loyal faschismusanfälligen by bankers , the international leader , who is doing everything it can to create a war with Iran , which is in the light of the membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Pakistan , Russia ... ) to quickly a global conflict may spread , and which is due to the control of Iran on the only two miles of broad Hormus , about 20 % of the world 's oil supplies , to destroy the world economy could come from .
In the light of the fact that the words to the 1994 Rockefellers David : ' The only thing we need is an over - arching crisis and the people will welcome the new world order .
In its presentation of the new world order is a world of slaves and gentlemen .
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of Finanzaristokraten .
A world in which any new - born babies born with a chip implantiert is to submit to the total control of this nature .
'And it is that the small and the large , the rich and the poor , the Free and servants all Malzeichen to give their right hand , or to buy or sell that no one is it because the Malzeichen , namely the name of the animal or the number of its name .
This is their wisdom , who has to consider the number of animal .
Because it is a number of people , and their number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig . '

'The people want am I the Republic , but I am just an amateur Okamura ' .
Senator , as it is to the idea , for the office of President to stand ?
It is not about being Senator or President .
If everything in our country without problems , I would not be standing .
But I can no longer see how the Republic since 20 years , as thieves will be plundered to roam freely , while the tax increase the retirement age and the people .
I had no ambitions to be a politician .
If I see something that I did not like to put forward a solution that I try to change this .
And , as I have already , 40 and independent and parteilos , I have no other way of influencing the things as a senator for the office of the President or to stand for election .
In the Senate , and you have managed to put it on the road to the Burg .
You will not back your voters ?
I have been told that I take up the fight to Burg after the result of senate .
Später I have this clarified and said that I for the office of President , if I am elected to Senator am going to stand for election .
My aim , however , is not the function . The role is an instrument with which I , my vision a reality .
This I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate .
The difficulty is not only that the people in the pub and in front of the television of the change , but to everyone , starting
The same applies to the media , to deprive the honour and the lie to the freedom of speech , the confused with freedom .
For me , for example , has been said that I would be bribing journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek advisers .
we speak about your vision .
The battle with the Burg you have the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retrospective Vermögenserklärungen over 20 million kroner .
The same applies to you need to change legislation .
When President , you have no powers in this regard , and only the Senate as a whole can table legislative proposals .
How do you intend to resolve this problem ?
As a citizen , I have argued that the tour guide a free trade , and it is to be implemented .
The problem is the small - minded policy , when someone from the right or the left with a good proposal , this is deliberately rejected , and this is just to the population .
The independent Parteiloser I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in the Parliament .
My advantage is that I have no Schubladendenken Parteidogmen me and from any party that what our country is the best we can take .
Can you see itself as a person in the policy more on the left or the right ?
The Czech point of view , it seems to me that the left me rather see the people .
For me this Rechts-Links-Denken , though , is quite important .
For me , it is important that we make progress .
It is not a question of whether someone on the left or on the right wing , and I would like to link the people .
Stets I support public any good solution , even if these KSČM or the ODS and , equally , I will turn against bad ideas .
It is you , when you referred to as the populists .
But you confirm this not by what you have just said ?
If you draw up in a company , then a Businessplan Idealziel and you also have a vision .
And do you wish to address this .
One can I describe it as populism , but all the proposals , of which I have spoken to operate in the world , or they have been discussed by important experts .
But without support in Parliament you remain mere buzzwords .
And so that you are not a long - term policy .
Oder you think that , for example , to the material and criminal liability ? you , if you only around long enough , the people will be able to talk about
I have no other option .
politicians , journalists and the public and to try to persuade them to get on our side in order to achieve these objectives .
When President , it is not a problem for me to call on the leaders of the parliamentary parties broadcast live on television , the substantive criminal law and to establish liability for politicians , officials , judges and prosecutors .
And the Angesprochenen would say if necessary , then , why do they object to this .
A strong personality , which refers to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene .
Take your only once the direct election of the President , which has been a credit to the public pressure .
I would like to say quite clearly that I am an amateur I am neither a genius ; an enlightened .
I am trying to find allies for my views and vision .
With the policy I have only just beginning and try to find that my programme for the support of the majority .
I am trying to make things even more ; and if it does not work , then I am again in six years in the private sector .
That sounds as though a little Okamura should save the Czech Republic .
I am not .
I know that I can do nothing for that reason alone , I have talked with several famous people whether they do not wish to stand for the Senate .
I have spoken with Radim Jančura for example , rejected , however , as a result of the excessive .
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová had , the fraud in the trade in a light fuel oil .
I began my candidacy with the requirement that the people are deeply unhappy , but now I am not sure .
Sechzig % of the electorate are not left to the elections , and who are elected representatives have been mostly the establishment .
The Senate we are only two independent .
The people have chosen Senatszusammensetzung a that such changes will be very difficult to implement .
Even so , I shall fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of the mayor and Bezirkshauptmänner .
that you thought about the establishment of the EU 's own party ?
I think I have not yet , because I have no time to review the past , and that any potential Parteimitglieds also do not have the money for it .
I do not even have money to Präsidentenkampagne ; my transparent accounts CZK only 20 000 .
You have no money ?
Vermögenserklärungen you are talking about , what would you ?
My personal fortunes I value of around CZK 60 million .
In Prague I have a piece of land , with a value of ECU 25 million , a home for around 10 million to 8 million , a further an art collection , which belongs , which is worth about 10 million , and a Ashton Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb , which is worth about a million . And then I have a couple of million to the bank account .
The Ashton Martin was a Kindertraum James Bond - I was always been , as it was in the car galant was to women and , at the same time , against the evil .
Martin a Ashton , you have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign ?
you say that you want to change the Republic , but your own money you want to invest in this .
That is not very convincing .
I do not have 15 million for the campaign .
Should I make up about debt ?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign .
The fact that I have any sponsors , shows that the programme is not a great deal of interest .
And I am not obliged to provide the campaign from its own resources .
The cost of the campaign , in essence , be covered by my salary as a senator .
But the Senatorengehalt I could not live alone ; I could , for example , my son not finance the English schools , the 30 000 per month .
If I only wanted to earn money , I would be able to stand for nothing .
Be so further than entrepreneurs have your work to make a living ?
Sagten you not feel that these activities are being cut ?
But this is not related to the level of pay .
As promised , I have cut back some of my activities .
However my deputy director of the agencies in the spring .
The people want to see , which saves me as Samaritan of the Republic .
But I must also live by .
An which you have been accustomed as entrepreneurs , monthly income ?
Approximately 200 000 and 400 , 000 , and that is still the case .
As President , I would , however , to my question .

The agency NASA US-Raumfahrtbeh has shown the existence of ice Merkur on the planet .

The Messenger is found evidence that it constantly in the region of the world , in the shadow of the ice sheet is .

The published by the European Southern the inclusion of several thousand Trifid-Nebel Sternbild Schütze in light - years away .
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus ( divided into three sections , dreigespalten ) , since even the dark Staubstreifen Sternen-Geburtsst ätte dreiteilen .
In Sternbild Schlangenträger Astronomen are photographed herald a cosmic Karambolage : 400 million light years away from earth to head the core two verschmelzender Galaxien and inevitable conflicting with each other .
This was on the Sternen-Geburt Hubble-Teleskop in the Spiralgalaxie M83 .

Our insight into space : The main Teleskope
The Teleskop to be invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before it began , Galileo Galilei Sternenbeobachtung to a year later .
Seitdem the mirror the optical Teleskope increasing and the insight that they provide , ever deeper .
30 years of 1947 , in 1975 was the Hale-Teleskop Palomar-Observatorium near San Diego the biggest Fernrohr the world .
Der Spiegel , here in the picture , had an average of five metres .
In Arizona , USA , the Large Telescope Binocular is .
It is right to look into space of two mirror , each with a diameter of 8.4 metres .
The plumbing of Gran Telescopio supporting Kanareninsel of La Palma is the mirror - alone is 10.4 metres in diameter .
Der Spiegel of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented , in order to save costs .
Even so , it achieved a diameter of some 11 000 metres .
The Teleskop is laid down - detriment of the favourable construction , and in his Höhenwinkel in its flexibility .
Even the Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas in Höhenwinkel is fixed .
His characteristic : the high Lichtsammelkraft .
This approach is , despite a comparatively low Spiegeldurchmesser - to the world 's largest Spiegelteleskope .
With the aid of a Radioteleskops in Arecibo ( Puerto Rico ) researchers from hearing the space for außerirdischen signals .
The Radioteleskop has a diameter of 305 metres .
In it the 'for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ' ( SETI ) every Computerbesitzer can help by Rechenleistung it is available .
on the European health observatory Sternwarte ( ESO or Chilenischen ) in the Andes .
Here the Very Large Telescope - that is , all his behalf .
With its total of four which can also mirrors Fernrohr ausleuchten Infrarotspektrum the average .
Ebenfalls to the Chilean ESO-Observatorium the European Large Telescope Extremely is planned .
His Hauptspiegel hefty should include the 42 , and almost 1 000 metres from Spiegelelementen be put together .
It is to be expected at the images and 2018 .
Until 2007 were the two Keck-Teleskope on the hawaiianischen volcano Mauna Kea , as the largest in the world .
two mirror provide you with an average of 10 metres .
The Keck-Teleskope Mauna-Kea-Observatoriums are part of , among them the IRTTF Subaru-Teleskop and which looks in the sky .
Even in the Mauna Kea a new , huge Teleskop is - with a Spiegel-Durchschnitt of 30 metres .
Here it is on a single incident at to .
The main impressions from the All this , however , provides Hubble Weltraumteleskop .
Since the 24 April 1990 it already provides pictures of distant worlds .
Since March 2009 the Weltraumteleskop Kepler extrasolaren planet - looking , especially for those who are .
On 2 February 2011 was announced that the Nasa 1235 Planetenkandidaten Missionsbeginn been identified .

One of the tasks of the telescope : It should seek light of the first stars and Galaxien after the big bang .
scientists from the assumption that the South Pole Merkur of the ice .
But there is no reliable data , since the Messenger far closer to the North Pole revolving around the planet .
Radarmessungen have for decades , suggest that the ice Merkur is .
The 2004 Messenger-Sonde - launched the first , which underpins the Merkur - the scientists have certainty .

The purchasing and selling Bitcoin is possible without Bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of the central banks , identified transactions and administrative fees between the parties .
I also , as so often in these technologies , is there a political vision : the belief that the current Bankmonopolen , of a monetary system leads to financial crises .
In fact , the pseudonym at Satoshi Nakamoto ( a ) imaginary Bitcoin is both a virtual currency ( in dollars , but EUR convertible currency etc . ) as well as a protocol for the safe exchange BitTorrent , as it facilitates the direct exchange of data files .
With 15 000 computers in the network of approximately 200 000 transactions have already been covered .
Several thousand sites Bitcoin accept a donation or as a means of payment .
Following the course of Bitcoin in June 2011 , reached a peak of 30 dollars ( it was EUR 23 five months later ) had USD 2 , today , before he has recovered about ten dollars ( the courses bitcoincharts.com are listed ) on the website .
Nothing Beeindruckendes particularly in relation to the currencies of real world trade or financial products .
however , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) has shown in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest of this .
you Bitcoin describes as ' virtual currency with the greatest success ' , 'in competition with the dollar or the euro ' and 'similar to the traditional currencies ' .
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the '- credits ' that will be used to make progress in a video game that we gain by games or buy ( and also sometimes zurücktauschen ) .
The social networking site Facebook has also developed a system of this kind .
But every time the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed .
With Bitcoin Netzknoten are all at the same time , repositories of the auditor Rechnungsbuchs Geld-Emittenten and buyers and sellers .
As this network work ?
Every transaction between two users in fact taking place between two e - mail addresses in the form of an e - mail .
The difference that users of a payment for each other , what guarantees can the anonymity .
A number of associated with this transaction data electronically signed by a double cypher system .
In this way , the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction .
it is also possible cooperation of the content of the database to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the entire network of widespread Rechnungsbuch of the public accounts are there .
The decisive step is to sign this new transaction in this paper .
This is done through a mathematical task , which will be launched on computers , the winners , of a kind of preliminary Zentralbankier is , has the privilege to add to this additional line .
It is a Zerstückeln of the database , that is , the transformation of a major file in a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprinting .
The computer 'take ' the new transaction and there are a number of 'before the whole zerhackt ' .
The aim is to find that number , it is a special fingerprint ( many decimal at the beginning .
If this figure has been found , other knots can easily examine whether it is the right one .
The transaction is associated in the long term with the chain of all transactions , and would change the fingerprint any modification .
If a user Betrügen very quickly to two times ( less than ten minutes ) pay with the same money would be the only one to two transactions to be validated by the network and the other has no link , as have the two different fingerprints .
The computer , who has been given the task of 50 Bitcoins .
To prevent inflation this prize is regularly halved , probably before the end of 2012 .
The Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million , but to a Hundertmillionstel divisible , which leaves a certain amount of room for manoeuvre .
I also the difficulty of the task to be stepped up with any improvement of Rechenleistung .
The lives of the network has already had the ups and downs .
The sites , to provide the services were attacked and Bitcoin Bitcoin-Einlagen stolen .
'The area is not a weakness in the actual Minutes ' Pierre Noizat assured , has just Paymium introduced , that is , companies pay for the real money Bitcoin the network .
The ECB has also reported on the possibilities of money laundering , through this anonymous service .
But there is also money on these shortcomings .
important players like Wikipedia Art . deny this donations
Among others , such as the Blog-Plattform WordPress they will be accepted .
Recently , and demonstrated the Adi Rechnungsbuch Shamir have analysed and Dorit Representative Ron of Weizmann-Institut in Israel that almost 80 % of Bitcoins not .
In November , a `` Mega-Schlussverkauf was launched ' .
'dollar ' Dreißigtausend have been exchanged , Jon Holmquist , the company for the working of the few Coinabul Bitcoins in gold .
Pierre Noizat , which is also a book about this currency , strongly believes in the potential of this technology as Transaktionsnetzwerk .
His Paytunia system is a credit card ( with real money ) or kontaktlosen payment with a mobile phone , but using Bitcoin the validation of transactions which are cheaper .
I also managed and its identity of the holder can therefore remain anonymous .
The system can be implemented with the dealers easy , and the latter must establish a new terminals or computer programs .
you simply have to provide an address by a telephone photographed 'and ' that it can be recognised , Pierre Noizat , to have the assurance that he has thousands of users .
It is considered to be a general trend in the hierarchical systems designed to benefit more horizontal systems .
'It will take some time before Bitcoin 2013 , but could be a turning point , he predicted .
The ECB is in her report to assess the different risks , today as well - respected in the event of a success of this new currency .

Eigener taste ru rosbalt - instead of culture .
Rosbalt is the project 'Petersburg vanguard , '' which is devoted to city dwellers , which are the avant - garde of the art and culture .
On the fine list already high - level representatives , of the Petersburg Kunstszene , whose achievements on the borders of the city and the often go beyond recognition in Europe , without the rest of Russia to be aware .
The new hero of the artists is Rosbalt extravagante Kirill Miller .
The entire city knows Kirill Miller , the red - clad Bärtigen that we may , to the Russian museum Sommergarten , or Vernissagen Szene-Treffen in them .
Where are the images of Kirill Miller , they also be issued to attract huge crowd .
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg sozial-philosophischen artists , which are creating new myths .
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personalities of the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the 1980s , or at the beginning of the 1990s .
He is a man of the city and by pulling its presence in the street with a smile on the face of its citizens and is causing them for good humour .
Before he recently schnappte a Drehorgel and the Petersburg Drehorgelspieler , as it is for these difficult role in terms of its Künstlerdasein , its image and its underlying philosophy was finally ready .
- Kirill why you are always in red and not for example in the city or Türkis ?
I have chosen a red Modedesigner on the optics and the image .
In this world of red is the compromise between artists , spin - doctors and society .
In a society is something quite different from what the Graunorm , aggression and bad behaviour .
I want to make my provocation but with the people .
Every an invitation was my last provocation to the discussion .
When you - wusstest painter , that you have to be ?
- In an exhibition in Kulturpalast Newskij were issued , in my work .
I realised that this is the way to go .
Then the period of the old free , but not officially recognised that painters , and new and free painter such as I was incomprehensible .
I like the painters are on friendly terms with the new generation , that is , with the representatives of the 'Gazonewschina ; hence , `` Puschkinskaja 10 , and then it was even closure .
It is there to the theatre , to fashion , music , literature , in addition to all .
So , all of the united in your Art-Klinik ... It was important to me , in the centre of the Petersburg culture , where the best should creative artists .
In 1995 , an area in which I occupied Puschkinskaja 10 and there to the renovation musikalisch-k ünstlerischen a club for the Boheme the House of the Petersburg Boheme .
Many were born there : N.O.M . Tequilajazzz , and I remember how string with its project 'Ucho Van Goga to ' .
string and his friends , simple songs on Play-back , wearing T - shirts and close to them and which today was mature composer Igor Wdowin .
When the group was started to play in Leningrad , its ' live ' .
Trachtenberg moderierte many programmes before the time of 'Halli-Galli ' .
We gave them Trachtenberg , and it began its great careers , but he met with us .
Even the gallery 'D 137 'or the ' club 'Griboedov have their origin in Art-Klinik .
Dorthin Stammgäste and our staff .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture still meant something .
In the year 2000 , there have been in the press , a survey of the prize 'personalities of our town of ' .
I received in the category of 'artists of the year , and I was reached peak .
It is not easy in new times for old rules to work ; I am a man of truth , honesty and culture of the last century .
At the present time , it is easy to be renowned , but culture and popularity are not the same : the famous It would be without a cultural contribution to make .
- your work , a distinctive form .
Many images , my very real gems and the timeliness and rigour of the idea .
I will be an exhibition on the issue of 'The Russian museum as students ' .
students are timeless .
I was socially however painful , but it now and is preparing to be afraid of .
In a clown the blurred and loses its tragedy .
I love the grotesque , and I was grotesque ideas .
- saving the world , for example by making that everyone has to dress up completely .
It respects everyone in the clothing and is based on the Outer and not at the heart of the people .
But perhaps we should give a people , but should not be biting the face of it .
The deceit by the Verkleiden disappear .
Before you - we saw recently in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers . - A City of Culture should have as a hero .
Who , if not I ?
- commercial art Will it be ?
Nowadays , must be cautious , with commercial art and flattering .
We see the disintegration of the cultures .
however , people were the major groups : The Bohemiens liebten the An ordinary people and the other .
Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften , and it is difficult to all .
I am no Einhundert-Dollar-Note that everyone likes .
Now , you have to consider what you will .
Now everyone Kultstar has approximately 100 supporters .
- On the appearances by Stas Michailow but there are several thousand .
- On him , abandoned women sexuell-soziale the world plays a role .
The 300 people and cultural reasons , not ten thousand , consequently , there is less money management , and everything .
I voted in favour , and the most important thing is not to deceive and they do not destroy what we have achieved .
In my youth I have painted such images to a collector even in a series of pictures of Falk and Larionow .
I started with pictures , which normally only at the end of the career .
Nowadays , there are many misunderstandings .
It says : intellectual culture and consumer culture .
consumption has no culture , this is something quite different .
I am a man of the past , culture and with artists , who were living in poverty and died in poverty and money , in order to be able to raise .
That is the culture , which I support .
- Kirill what Petersburg ?
- the best Kulturexperten .
It says : servants of culture .
However , not all of them can deal with culture .
In the real tsars it was different , because the Tsars may not seen much of culture , but they understood that right experts are necessary .
In Moscow , there are currently good advisers .
The St. Petersburg , we have the experts , but they could be blocked , the way in which it is properly assess hochrangigerer experts and the former open to them .
Now only one 's own taste .
Erarta applies to do this , however , with the difference that they say in all honesty that it does not accept any contemporary art and therefore some painters need to seek other museums .
- Concerning for thee Petersburg ?
- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow ; there is much more culture and a breeding ground .
At our stones art can only grow .
We need a cultural breeding ground for example , because we now have more than reader writers , and that is not true .
In Europe , there are many people who are visiting organises concerts exhibitions or .
For us , these are much less .
art must again be up - to - date , as at the beginning of the last century .
The project will be financed from grants the town of St Petersburg

The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution .
In the last week of the Constitutional Court , the law on non - profit - making activities .
This decision was a lively debate in the public .
It is interesting to look at the issue again in a broader perspective .
The liberal - oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world , are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition .
In effect , this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other .
the principle is that of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital , with the unbridled speculation to go hand in hand .
Due to the large differences of the value of work ( wages ) will Preisspannungen .
Under this concept of a state is , to understand the manufacturers to be tried , by means of import cheaper goods in the economic competition , undercutting 'competition ' to a larger market and to increase its profits .
On a large scale , this means for the majority of companies or to relocate their production abroad to buy cheap there , or give up their business . The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs .
Since the private sector will be no social responsibility and , therefore , no responsibility for unemployment necessarily caused by the increase in public spending .
This situation is made even worse by the fact that these gentlemen will entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes , and in the way they have caused to replace overall economic and social damage .
This situation is well known , so that specific statistics on this point are superfluous .
The brutal practice of private capital in the individual economies to create a situation in which the governments are forced to enter into competition with each other , in order to artificially reduce the level of social and their own people to attract foreign investment into the country .
In other words , the governments will provide for their own people , without any regard for the social consequences of the private capital .
This is particularly in changes to existing legislation .
it is the aim of these measures , to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital , particularly in terms of wages .
This is the result of economic pressure on a long - term unemployment , on the other , the exclusion of workers ' rights .
The outcome is growing poverty , as well as increasing differences between the rich and the poor .
In Germany , there are several years , public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people , are no longer able to feed through their own work .
The number of people affected is already in the million .
In the wake of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly cases in which employees are given such a low pay , that the state to increase their income below subsistence level .
One such scandal was also brought to light in the case of workers employed in the German Bundestag .
The austerity üdstaaten practically all EU will undoubtedly be in the same situation in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate , ( as was the case in the 19th century , or for a pittance on the margins of society and about whom we hope that some private capital will be channelled into the country .
We are naturally , the question of where this capital ?
If it is from another EU country , only the poverty moves from one country to another , from the capital or remains altogether , because in China , India , Brazil , in Turkey , Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees are working for a fraction of the European wages .
This concerns the whole of Latin America .
Liberal theories and media allege that ad nauseam that the state is not with capital to its own economy , and that involved a planned economy leads to economic catastrophe .
The private sector a narrow - minded insists on its position , that the state lenkend not intervene in the economy .
Then , but the question is whether this is the whole of the State affected in their own selfish interests , or even not the policy and capital .
Here the clear answer is yes .
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all Member States .
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption , of mutual benefit , of legislation in which practically everything , but nothing is criminally punishable .
In Germany , the situation is that a lack of finance private Staatsministerium is responsible , with the industry verflochtene Rechtsunternehmen with the drafting of legislative proposals .
This draft legislative proposals be adopted later in the Bundestag .
All violence is not more popularly announce , such as the western constitutions , but rather by strong financial groups , their own interests .
Obviously the liberal democracies are now quickly end up in a situation in which it describes as Appian in its work on the crisis at the time of the Roman Republic Cäsars Pompeius ' and that 'the state was seen for a long time , and the break - up of the offices have been filled with violence .
Schmiergeld retaliatory , illegal or fraudulent use of advantages in stone and sword .
The corruption has grown , and not the people involved have to buy votes ' ... 'people with nature bewarben does not consider that the state authorities , as a result of this decline eight months it had already started talking about a consul really ... ' to 'that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a dictatorship , and that a strong man should be chosen ' ... Appian thought but while Pompeius strong man , which will ultimately be Caesar was replaced by the dictatorship lasting democracy .
As it turns out , today 's society is based in ancient times , as well as to the reckless preference of their own advantage , without on societal interests .
The private capital is by its very nature , not in a position to recognise and enforce the benefit of the whole of society .
The result is that today , as then , is an unprecedented decadence of elites , not the slightest concern for more in - depth reforms .
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism , therefore , we must seek the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries .
From today 's state of view , the destruction of these regimes in favour of a liberal democracies break a certain degree , already the next round .
disastrous is special about 140g the fact that today 's elites in future the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives , the humanitarian and social catastrophes , we are already witnessing today , as well as the crimes against humanity , as they are , we know from the older and more recent history , in total ignorance .
The lifting of the law on voluntary work is no solution , at least no lasting .
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition to the Czech Republic will be forced to look for ways to reduce the level of social provision for the population .
This trend is therefore bound .
The only solution - are targeted the reforms to increase the capital of the State in the economy , and increase the influence of citizens to the government of the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state .

A Republican strategy in order to counter the re - election of President Obama
The leaders of the Republican justify its policy with the need to combat fraud .
But the Brennan Centre , the latter is a myth , and confirm that the electoral fraud in the United States is far less than the number of people killed by the - .
The lawyers have the Republicans in 10 years in the USA is only 300 cases of fraud .
One fact is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the level of participation .
In this sense , these measures are undermining the democratic system in the United States .
In contrast with Canada are the states for the conduct of the elections in the individual States .
In this sense , has announced new laws , the majority of the American governments since 2009 , the more difficult the procedure for the registration or the elections .
This phenomenon has gained after the elections in November 2010 , 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states were able to be recorded .
Consequently , 180 draft laws have been introduced in the year 2011 , the constraints on the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States .
The new laws are demanding that the voters present a Lichtbildausweis citizenship and a proven US-Staatsb .
I also by this legislation will also reduce the time periods for the early vote declared invalid , the right to register on election day itself as voters and citizens , denied the right to vote , for which a Gerichtsakte .
Before the elections in 2006 has no US-Staat from the electorate to show that a Lichtbildausweis .
Indiana was the first federal state , who has made this request .
The Supreme Court of the United States , in 2008 the constitutionality of the law by Indiana .
The Republican authorities are hurrying to extend it to other countries .
In the course of the last two years in 34 bred legislation states with which the electorate , to show a Lichtbildausweis .
It is important to note that , in contrast to the US citizens Quebec not on a universal cards as the health card .
In fact , 11 % of US citizens have , i.e . 21 million Dutch people , not of a governmental authority of their state Lichtbildausweis issued .
I also five million Neuwähler in 2012 , we do not have such a card .
But often to pay more than a hundred dollars , in order to receive the necessary document .
Of the new restrictions are affected disproportionately by young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
In fact , an African American have 25 % , 15 % of people with an income of less than 35 000 dollars , 18 % of people over 65 years and 20 % of the voters between 18 and 29 not have the necessary Lichtbildausweis .
This goes further .
The students who are regarded as voters , to cast their votes for the more democratic candidates , it is not permitted in a number of Member States , from its creation to its use Lichtbildausweis issued .
Andererseits the same States allow members of fish or Jagdvereinen , the more the Republican side to choose to use of these associations cards issued for elections .
Before 2004 , has called for a federal state , the voters for proof of citizenship .
Arizona was the first state that such a demand is introduced .
For 2011 , a dozen laws adopted by the voters States , demand that US-Staatsb to prove their citizenship .
These measures are designed to limit the clearly hispanischen votes .
Because it is clear that only two of the three hispanischen voters , prefer the democratic party .
I also Republican legislators have promoted laws in 2011 in eight states , with which the registration of voters on the day of the elections has been abolished .
I also would have limited the right of individuals and groups , to make those voters want to help .
These restrictions are not without consequences .
Beispielsweise 2004 the campaigns have contributed to the registration of voters in the general election , ca . 10 million citizens to register .
Because since 2009 by the measures adopted to reduce the share of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 17 % in 2006 .
laws : the Republican legislators have adopted in another five states , which aim to shorten the period for the early vote .
Beispielsweise in the general election in Florida 2008 was 33 % of the voters who have chosen an African American in advance , although it only 13 % of the voters of the federal state .
hispanische the same goes for the population .
of the latter was only 11 % of the electorate , and 24 % of the citizens who elected in advance .
In contrast , the White from the 76 % of the voters , only 46 % of the voters who elected in advance .
Of course the democratic legislator and their trailers strongly opposed to the adoption of legislation which restrict the registration of voters .
Several proposals have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors .
The Advocate - General of the United States to intervene to suspend the most contentious legislation .
you were able to limit the damage in part .
Beispielsweise only 16 have adopted the 34 states that the laws are showing a Lichtbildausweises .
But the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote .
The democratic critics to condemn the political nature of the legislation adopted and seeing them as a clear aim of influencing the results , in the major states for 2012 .
A report of the Brennan 2011 - that those of 270 votes Wahlmännergremium are needed in order to win the Presidency , has shown that Member States have adopted this legislation , 171 ,
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system have a considerable impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in the year 2012 .
But one thing is for sure : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the level of participation .
In this sense , these measures are undermining the democratic system in the United States .

The word 'human rights ' is missing in the Constitution

The future European Constitution with the sharia as the basis is controversial .
The Egyptian President with emotion years .
We must create the transition .
'And that it is able , under my responsibility , before the people and to God in the state television service ' , he said .
His speech was addressed to all the people , but above all for the Christian Coptic Christians , Muslims and the Liberals , enlightened Säkularen .
They all , has so far been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition , are afraid .
fear of a theocracy , there remain the Nile of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood .
He , Mohammed Mursi said almost entschuldigend temporarily extended , and reduced the powers of the constitutional court , its competences in order to save the revolution ' .
However , the saving of 61-j - year - old engineer a doctorate the American University of Südkalifornien , really wants to the Egyptians , the world is not very much .
Should the judiciary to be removed ?
In fact , Article 234 which are dominated by the Islamist 100-k - strong Constituent Assembly as a night , 15-st Parforceritt - have been pushed through some worrying .
As in previous constitutions , even , as is stated in the draft , the case - law in the form of 'principles of Islamic law ' .
However , what does ' principles ' ?
It was and is subject to interpretation and it is to be feared that they use the woolly formulation and the associated legal scope for a strict interpretation of the Sharia .
That suggests hinzugeführter at least a new article , the Sharia law in all these matters , will consult with the Al-Ashar-Universit , Islamic to the most important institution of the country with a great deal of power in the whole of the Sunni Islam .

After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11 000 civilians in Militärhaft .
The state should also , as it stands , the draft 'protection ' and 'promote the true nature of the Egyptian family ' their morals and its values .
This is legally so unclear that state institutions , with the help of this article control even the content of cinema and literature .
In plain language , this means nothing other than censorship .
No Article , moreover , explicitly states , the equality of men and women .
This is another to insult and the Prophet Mohammed and its envoy to slander .
What , however , is an insult to how they should be punished , remains unclear .
Just dubious is the wording of the 'insult to the people ' is banned .
Reicht as a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer .
interpretation , as so much in the draft , the Mursi to sign and very soon after the words ' the Egyptians to the referendum will be presented .
'The revolution has returned '
The opposition is taking shape , for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists .
tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual consensus on Friday in Cairo in Tahrir Square and promised to bring the Charter , even before they can enter into force .
'The revolution has returned and that we will win ' Hamdin Sabbahi Drittplatzierter said , the presidential elections .
Nobel Peace Prize winner and Mohamed El Baradei 's Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency has said , the draft Constitution was one 'on the scrapheap of history ' .
Via Kurznachrichtendienst Twitter Mursis supporters , it is the result of a military coup against the 'democracy ' .
'When he devoted to the referendum , we will go to his palace and the opposition , said that ' Said Yasser .
'We are still not tire of the blood of our brothers is not punished , the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali .

The well - organised blies Muslim Brotherhood , for its part , but not as a demonstration in Tahrir Square , but after a Massengebet Nilufer on the other , the Cairo university .
Many veiled Salafisten and supporters of the women involved , and said : `` The people calls for the application of God 's law . '
you called for by Mursi Säubere : ' the country , and several occasions : `` The Koran is our constitution ' .
A battle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square in which all started , would have created conditions resembling civil war .
The Mursis risk supporters were clearly not .
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents and supporters of the draft Constitution would be said loud and clear .
Now is the time to the ballot box , the people to decide the direction of the country should be .
A majority of the Islamists is safe .
The word 'rights ' is not even
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about the Constitution , the upsurge in fact have until February and to involve all the social forces .
The 48 years of human rights lawyer and leader of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights ( EOHR ) defended the Muslim Brotherhood under Mubarak , as they are in prison or in the courts .
Not because it would share their belief , but because of human rights are indivisible .
This was beaten and arrested and sentenced .
'And now , human rights is not even in the new Constitution , he complains in talks with the ' world 'on Sunday .
Mursi Machtausweitung to all three powers in the state of the lawyer can act .
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of play and Egypt will result in a new dictatorship .
Instead of having to 'strengthen the civil society , the President to do it de facto override Saeda ' .
However , without a functioning democracy , civil society organisations .
Saeda feel abandoned by the international community , which considers the ideological Richtungskampf the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension .
That could be apparent .

Porras explains that the academic , Marc Prensky Master-Titels holder of a university teaching in Yale and author of the plant Immigrants ' and 'Digital Natives formte these words of explanation of the phenomenon .
The digital Natives they are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology .
'We are the digital immigrants to teach them , even when we learn ' , he says .
He said that it is a complex issue , because we demand that they have a criterion about what is said or published in an age , and this is where the maturity of this ' is not enough .
'pick you should also be added that , if it is to have thousands of his friends , without thinking about the consequences , is most important for them to be popular
According to the expert , which is the most effective way , to teach children and young people , which is their privacy , it provides food for thought .

Do you know what the other you made public ?
Have you asked for permission before the other people , if you have a label of photographs of celebration ?
And yet Müssen all know , a question : what you are doing in any moment ?
There is one further point to give them to understand that they have to act , as online do offline .
It is the same rules .

In a constantly elektrisierten world , it is all very well to be bored
I spent Thanksgiving This unexpected five hours , and the airport as our aircraft operated by mechanical problems we had to wait for another aircraft queuing .
I therefore had enough time to me to make a few thoughts on boredom .
I will not lie .
Finding a half a day to wait at the airport on a flight , is quite nervtötend - even when books , magazines and iPhones steuerfreies go shopping ) ( and , of course , be made available .
But increasingly Kindesentwicklungsexperten lead to academics and boring as something positive .
If it is to them , it is for us , and our children - sometimes seem to be .
That the brain will be forced to lose in interesting considerations , which is perhaps the creativity .
And because most of us , today , almost constantly on one or other to screen the rigid advantages of boredom not more .
Sollten we welcome with open arms the boredom ?
Yes .
And no .
I repeat : ' come .
Like many people , I am always assumed that relatively topical boredom a phenomenon which has developed more leisure time .
However , Mr Peter Toohey , Professor for Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of 'Boredom : A Yale University ( Lively History ' Press , 2011 ) , that is not the case .
'In fact the boredom has a very long history , he says .
The fault Hauswände Pompejis Latin on boredom graffiti on the first century .
And then there is the question is , how do we define boredom .
John D. Eastwood , a partner in the university professor of psychology Ontario York , the problem is that , according to many kinds of boredom Canada to be defined and has been discussed .
After long read Forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of almost 100 people were Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion that , as the experience of boredom 'exercise , a satisfactory result , it does not want to be able to define ' .
boredom differs from apathy , therefore , that the person , but this would not work .
The apathy , on the other hand , there is no desire to do something .
The Schlüsselerfahrung of boredom , he says , is to 'disturbance of Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses , coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slow ' .
boredom can listen to this almost as depression .
But , although Professor Eastwood believe these two conditions in relation to people are bored could see the problem in their surroundings or the world , while depressive people see the problem in itself .
Sometimes we that is boring us , even if we do not just have to focus .
In their report 'The Unengaged Mind Defining Boredom in terms : Attention ' in German , for instance : `` The untätige reason : The definition of boredom in terms of 'attention in September in the journal ' Perspectives on Psychological Science 'appeared , Professor out Eastwood , and his colleagues on an earlier experiment in a single volume , the participants to listen to a Magazinartikel read a person .
Some groups have heard a resounding channel from the neighbouring region , which has nothing to do with the content was heard it on others ; low noise level , so that it was barely perceptible , while the third group is not at all a noise , I heard this .
The people who have heard the barely recognisable television , to try to have more boredom as the other two groups - they had problems to focus , for this could be no reason to their difficulties and wrote the boredom .
If you try to concentrate on a difficult and demanding task could lead to disruption of boredom , Mark says J. Fenske for neuroscience progresses , associative professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study .
If , on the other hand , makes for tedious work into 'as the search for defective products on a Fabrikförderband that music bored and can help to feel , not ' .
In fact , he says , we now know that Herumzappeln Kritzeln and often interpreted as a sign of boredom , this can even be fought by physical persons to be more vigilant .
'studies have shown that children learn herumhampeln Professor more and more than those who are forced to Stillsitzen ' Fenske must keep information .
We will , at some point , all wearing my delayed flight - a dröhnender , loudspeakers particularly ermüdender film industry .
But some people bore more easily than others .
In order for these differences , researchers - developed in the 1980s to a ' scale Langeweileanfälligkeit ' .
Following the statements such as ' will find many things that I have to do is repeat and monotonous ' and'I have many interests , that I do not have enough time for everything .
help of such scale researchers have discovered that more girls than boys , tedious as Stephen Vodanovich , a professor at the University of psychology Westflorida , in particular , as regards the need for more and a wider range of external stimuli .
But in general are a fairly abgespannter bunch of teenagers .
In 1991 , Reed Larson by Professor for human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois , an experiment where he kontaktierte almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager .
He found out that 32 % of adolescents in schools and in the homework Erledigen if they were not at school , whereas bored and bored , 23 % .
However , only 3 % of parents to have to feel bored .
Professor Larson now saying that he does not know whether the exact percentages 21 years later , in terms of boredom have increased or decreased .
He is sure , however , that 'the young people as extremely boring because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their mainly perceived Alltagsablauf . '
Back to my Ursprungsfrage : Is boredom healthy ?
Sometimes , in extreme cases , because it means that people and extreme physical risks to gambling , or drugs , in order to alleviate the studies have shown .
Andererseits many philosophers and authors to examine the relationship between boredom and creativity . This opinion is Professor Vodanovich the issue of research , for more than two decades .
'With the boredom the brain want to say that we should do something different , Mr Marcus , psychology professor at the University of New York .
But the brain , do not always know what is best in particular .
If a dull and the energy we use to play and to cook Gitarre , you will be happy .
However , in the short term for TV can ensure that these verflüchtigen Glücksgefühle long term , but again .
If his bored child is an iPad , so that it can be diverted from boredom . It has not , however , in order to maintain or to control , Professor Fenske says .
And it also adds that 'self - regulation is a situation of ' on the other .
The baby learns , not only to maintain but also in other areas to be more self - regulation .
I do not think we should celebrate boredom .
Even we should not be too critical .
Stattdessen our aim should be to us at ease outside the permanent Aktivitäts and Technologieberieselung .
Professor Eastwood to the vote .
'It sounds as we often have to be boring . But boredom is distressing , relentless desire to do something meaningful ' , he says .
He believes that the people are in reality , only after a way , to shut down and less so .
'In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert , it is difficult to discuss even if the noise is . '

NKÚ - head : control of Schwarz-Systems by the failed policy
the Czech Republic has , in relation to public contracts , have good control bodies and adequate legislation , however , is in its application .
In conversation . cz Aktuálně to say this to the Vice - President of the Supreme Kontrollamtes ( Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad , Miloslav Kala NKÚ ) .
'A law is never perfect , but it must be applied correctly - and I believe that that is not the case of ' Kala commented on the current situation .
On a similar result also seems to be a common control by Czech and the German auditors .
The negative Praxisbeispiel it leads to the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so - called `` Schwarz-System ' .
Unlängst the Prime Minister said that the ODS hector the entrepreneurs with them or not , the system is now would be banned ?
must have a valid law , and if something is prohibited by law , but it is not simply the Regierungsvorsitzende , and hinder the surveillance office , whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law in its activity Kala notes .
At the sitting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies , you spoke about a common tschechisch-deutsches project , in the framework of the legislation on public contracts were both countries compared with each other .
Worum was because in practical terms ?
There is a parallel with the review of some two years ago we started .
Vereinfacht said , it is important that the European legislator lays down , public contracts are to handle the national legislation on : '.. And finally , there is the real practical application .
This all we have gathered , and although the test has not yet been completed , we have seen is extremely interesting differences . It is generally said that the laws are we are perhaps even a little 'strict and perfect , but the real application in Germany is better in some parameters .
That confirms that we must always look at it again with the new and more precise rules to establish proper application of the law , is not enough .
to what extent you the project can be a help for you ? What emerges from this project ?
That is precisely such a joint control could contribute to this , that we must stop constantly seeking to perfecting the laws and the lowering of thresholds , and balancing if it is apparently not very good .
efficiency means to acquire a matter of excluding and at a reasonable price ( which is not always the lowest price is ) illegitimate wealth or even criminal acts .
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts can not guarantee that we also achieve this objective .
Perhaps it is even the case that we are a burden on the system in this way with excessive paperwork 'only ' and those who seek to exploit loopholes in the system , the system simpler than the threshold values have remained higher .
you talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Vergabegesetzes .
As the system works in Germany ?
Is there a similar body here as our NKÚ , or the system operates in a different way ?
What concerns the authorities , it is the German equivalent NKÚ the Federal Audit Office , which is similar to what we have built up and also by a college , that will only be set up in a slightly different way . In principle , however , the two authorities are working .
Even the competences are comparable to a certain extent , and Germany is , however , a federal state , in other words that there are these courts of auditors in the individual states , the German system is different from our own .
The federal funding only BRH must control , which is in line with our public funds .
Public funds are managed by the districts and communities , there will be subject to the control of Landesrechnungshöfe .
What concerns the German legislation , is the easier than ours ?
What I would like this without any definite indications only Nichtsdestoweniger Germany , in some respects , is often described as a model , but we certainly can not say that Germany in particular , is better .
Liegt that , perhaps , that the auditors are better ?
That certainly not , but as I have said , which I do not particularly like to make comparisons .
Hierzu that those countries which for us are a model , also with the problems it is facing .
If this were not the case , it would not be true cooperation with our authority , not ?
What concerns the Czech legislation , the importance of your authority had Vergabegesetzes of the amendment , you have any consequences ?
In view of the fact that these amendments only a short time in force , it is not yet in our assessments .
Since our controls take place later , we must here with a degree of delay .
feel we have so far been rather in the preparation of future controls , we have introduced the new instrument of control and identification of risks of 'waste ' in this almost 14 , public procurement - examined and analysed the amendments will have an impact , of course , as the thresholds , the conditions for certain types of invitations to tender , among other things , have been modified
Can you see the adoption of this law rather positive , or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy ?
I think and hope that this law is a step in the right direction that confirms this assumption .
It can , however , the problem is that the rules will be strict 'and ' can no longer be respected .
Right from the previous rules , a verification unterzogenen people are against the agencies ( for example , in the case of an operational programme of regional policy , the regional council ) to be accountable , so that any failure to respect the Vergabegesetzes a violation of budgetary discipline .
Is it sensible , however , then we have to make the law ?
In my opinion , it is not this way .
The system must exclude and those who want to abuse the system , and not penalise those who have made a formal errors , not on the actual decision - making .
A system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure .
Where is the solution ?
we say , first of all , what is not good .
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS lay not entrepreneurs with controls of the so - called `` Schwarz-Systems ' - what exactly does this mean ?
Is this now or permitted Schwarz-System banned ?
A law must , however , have its period of validity , and if something is prohibited by law , but it is not simply the Regierungsvorsitzende and impede the surveillance office , whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law , in his work .
He can say : `` We amend the law and allow the matter , but he could not say that we would be as if nothing to do .
It contains a relatively strict rules on procurement law which owes much to the formal out certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition .
On the other hand , however , it is also a tragedy if the offeror with the best offer Formfehlern solely on the grounds of being excluded .
The law never will be perfect , but it must be applied properly , and that is what I think is missing .

Australian laws in force for uniform Zigarettenverpackungen
caring and health warnings on packets , neutral green body to which all are equal where brands
The world 's first international laws for single cigarette and Australia Tabakverpackungen entered into in force . This Markenlogos and colours , replaced by neutral olivgrüne lid , moreover , with the dramatic images are the sick and body parts : '1 shot by cigarette smoke are sick infants and children .
Of the various health warnings and images from next Saturday , apart from the only difference is between the packages in the small print in the small print , are identical .
That Australia is leading the world 's most stringent rules for Tabakverpackungen .
The Australian Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by the glamouröse picture of tobacco consumption .
Let the government from is based on studies have shown that people who , with 26 have not yet started , with 99 % probability , will no longer be starting to smoke .
'You can already see in children , young age that they are trying to understand the message , to apply the tobacco companies with their Markenbild Bundesgesundheitsministerin Tanya Plibersek , you quoted the studies have shown that children , for example , to associate the crown of a logo with the idea of Princess .
Although Australia and one of the lowest Raucherquoten the world only minor changes to the profits of the multinationals , will consider other countries already have similar steps .
The tobacco lobby hard fought against the law .
However , it has been said with the laws of encouraging Schwarzmarkthandel to cheaper cigarettes and easily accessible .
Scott McIntyre says : ' The legislation will lead to serious unintended consequences of 'British American Tobacco Australia .
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will provide much greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia .
Other , however , say that the laws have given their business .
to see by Sandra Ha Zico import Pty Ltd , a small family businesses , that the demand for Zigarettenetuis Silikondeckeln and to cover the intolerable packaging is increased enormously , since the corporations British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco , Britain 's Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago , on top of the Australian Court , with its protest against the laws failed .
Zico have to be sold at 6 000 units Großhandelsgeschäfte waiting for new resources .
For us this is a good deal .
the catch , according to the experts , is the popularity social media in the section to which the plan .
A number of australischer legislation , has banned from the tobacco companies TV-Werbung , it prohibits Sportsponsoren them , as the majority of businesses and forced to stop shops cigarettes . Now the tobacco advertising on the Internet is changed .
The Australian Government has banned by local companies and Internet pages , however , has no influence on international sides .
'Who marketed , and tobacco has only a small area , in order to promote their products to the Internet is not ' Becky Freeman says , a researcher in the health sector in the University of the Sydney Olympics .
The social media , Facebook and Twitter and YouTube Freeman has established an increase in Erfahrungsberichten to trade marks that of 'ordinary people ' .
We must ask the question : Is it just a private individual , the great favours Marlboro-Zigaretten will take place , even that they include a video - or has a Marketing-Agentur to do with it ?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry instead of marketing point of the new laws to concentrate .
you has even gone so far , the Ukraine , Honduras and the Dominican Republic , to pay for the new rules to those who complain about the World Trade Organisation on unfair Handelseinschränkungen , although none of the countries has increased trade with Australia .
A WTO ruling is expected for mid -2013 .
Plibersek , the government has held talks with other countries which consider similar Verpackungsgesetze .
Canada was the first country that would include photographic warnings required .
Mittlerweile these were extended to more than 40 countries , including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
Härtere laws be considered in the United Kingdom , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
Many of the Australian smoker does not show itself .
The pictures not me .
I simply ignoring them .
'We are simply a bad way and takes away the box , Victor says ' El Hage , when buying a packet of Mundtumor is a photograph with a copy .
Frankly speaking , there is only one reason why I would stop , and that is my little girls .
James Yu operators ' King of the aims of the Pack 'in the inner city of the Sydney Olympics , says that the uniform packaging have stacking shelves it more difficult .
'I have , however , taken a consignment einzusortieren to now , I have no need of four ' Yu says .
'The government could have simply to ban all cigarettes , then we would have said ' OK , that 's was that we pull 'it is also clearly furious .

Poland and the space .
Last week , Poland has been received with him on the Member States of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) as a member of this space body zwanzigstes . Poland is the second Member State from the former Eastern bloc countries ( to the Czech Republic , that on 12 November 2008 was ESA-Mitglied ) .
Poland in 1994 close cooperation began with the ESA and participated in the following years in several ESA-Projekten .
The path of Poland in the space of course , start much earlier .
The very before the Second World War , Polish Kosmosbegeisterte are employed in the space sector , but they were not always easy to understand .
I recall , for example , of the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw observatory , in which the author of its pioneering ideas presented Kosmonautik included 'to ' .
The ideas of the young engineer . 1905 ) ( and the people were , however , and following years , only Šternfeld that Dr Jan Gadomski shown interest in his work has reminded us .
Šternfeld won in 1934 Kosmonautik 'for ' entrance to the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten REP-Hirsch announcing .
Dr Jan Gadomski ( he later - 1996 ) has been an important supporter of astronomy and space industry .
In Polish magazines published and hundreds of articles he wrote several books to these scientific disciplines .
Gadomskis of internationally recognised contribution to the development of space has been appreciated by , among other things , that a Krater erdabgewandten on the side of the moon after he was appointed .
Right in the year in Poland in 1925 a Eisenbahn-Draisine was built on a Raketenantrieb was planned .
The author of the text and the details of this project , unfortunately I do not know .
It is not yet clear whether the rocket the brakes or off the Draisine should be used .
The information that come exclusively from the contemporary press .
In 1933 to the Polish infantry started raketenbetriebenen with bullets .
The research , the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi .
is clear that research for the documents provided to the stage of practical tests was .
The research was interrupted by the invasion , of course , then the German .
In the year of 1937 appeared in the press of the message of originating . Rohoziński draft fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete , and the following year , the work was ' Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza 'Leliwa-Krzywoblocky of the author .
Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs .
short before the war were all projects to military use of the missile technology by the person who was scientific advisory committee ( Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy ) .
The committee was set up in 1937 , after two years of hard work was its work by the end of the war .
Another article appeared after the war , the aerospace and thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft ( Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne ) in the Polish press .
The first discussion of this takes place in society in 1954 Novemberausgabe Problemy the magazine , in the four major article devoted to the space industry .
The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a Raumfahrtgesellschaft .
At the time , there were already the first projects to satellite technology , and it was clear that the research of space would have a future .
Right in its inception in 1956 , the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA tried to join up to the 1951 International Federation for space travel , and indeed the PTA has already been in the autumn of 1956 proper Member .
In the following year , was the first PTA-Vorsitzende , Kazimierz Zarankiewicz ( 1902 - 1959 ) , vice - chairman of the International Federation for space travel .
This office he has been holding up to his death in 1959 .
Since the 1956 PTA significantly involved in the development of the most successful meteorological missile ( Rakieta Meteorologiczna ) , the first Polish missile for scientific research .
The first type RM-1 , which was concluded in 1957 , the first start was made on 10 October 1958 .
The rockets with a maximum altitude of 1 800 metres around 80 cm was long and weighed not entirely 5 kg .
Später an improved version , which was built RM-1A , in 1959 , and started in the test flights Błędów - desert with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2 .
The rocket 1.4 m was long and weighing kg approximately 11.5 .
Another development should already be in a position to provide genuine scientific work and the missile RM-34 should achieve an altitude of up to 14.5 km for the monitoring of Höhenwinden .
In 1962 , however , the further development has been discontinued .
successor of the first type RM the rockets in 1962 to 1965 Meteor-1-Rakete developed .
The rocket , was conceived Zweistufenrakete than 510 cm was their overall length and the take - off weight was 32 500 kg .
From this missile ( Meteor-1A three types have been developed , -1 B -1 and C in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments .
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport , with 0.4 litres Meteor-1B on 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C on 0,62 litre .
The maximum altitude , in all three types of 37 km .
In the years to 1968 in the 1965 Luftfahrtinstitut Meteor-2-Rakete has been developed , the first test flights in 1970 began in October .
Meteor-2 had a take - off weight of 380 kilograms , and was able to implement a 10 kg in a level of around 60 km .
after the versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 .
Erwähnenswert is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1960 , the two years later , the establishment of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses followed .
Poland participated in the framework of the Interkosmos-Programms also with Soviet satellite in space , and in 1978 , was the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut second .

At our concerts Šimon Ornest : we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world that , in less than a month to take place ?
This is one of those Katastrophenmeldungen , to which we are so keen to function .
With our band The Tap Tap we are rather fun and to say that we are the only link to the world of the collecting sufficient positive energy in order to prevent or stop the end of the world , can .
In December , you have kept also a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world .
Can you imagine our readers to this project ?
It is a national Benefizveranstaltung , which we are already two years .
Hierfür we want to use the Marketingpotenzial Maya-Kalenders of the end of the day , is forecast for the 21 December at 11:10 a.m..
The day before , that is , on 20 December , from three organises concerts at 21:00 at the same time take place in Prague and Ostrava Brno .
The end is organises concerts about the time of Kiribati on the Pacific in a zone of 12 hours before us is the Maya-Kalender .
From whom this idea ?
My original , then I think we have reached together with the idea of our Grafiker Honza Augusta .
Let us not only to collect sufficient positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world , we should also consider , together with the public , but in which we state our children all over the world .
The end of the Maya-Kalenders we have developed a unique range of shoes , T - shirts , pockets and Schlüsselanhängern against the end of the world , with whose purchase on www.e-tap.cz we can also support the people .
The band The Tap Tap has begun , together with other actors also the so - called national anthem against the end of the world with the title 'statements from is ' .
The very today the anthem is very popular on YouTube . Will it also being proposed in the Benefizkonzerten ?
Of course , at the very end , provided that all the work and the end of the world is not taking place .
The hymn sung by all actors to be at all three concerts at the same time .
the anthem also be broadcast live together in a Direktschaltung the Czech television .
The text of the anthem was played by Tomáš Hanák , the main character of Jesus in Videoclip Xindl X , with is ...
As you have come to the cooperation with the two ?
We also cooperate with other people , the Czech Kulturszene connected with that we implement many Benefizveranstaltungen organises concerts and ...
We are trying to involve those people involved in the projects .
affair has shown that most to cooperate with us and are keen to have fun .
Welchem purpose of the proceeds , organises concerts benefit against the end of the world ?
For the creation of integrated Bildungszentrums Studeo we already six years , together with the club Tap Jedlička Institute in - work .
The students - regularly Jedlička Institute of teachers , with the help of various leisure activities .
Since the pupils themselves do not have the resources to go before the assistants , we would like to help them in this way .
In the completion of a separate institute Jedlička - building in which we have to work with this project .
At each stage of several groups and the interpreters .
After what criteria you have chosen this ?
We wanted to put together a programme , which addresses all the generations , including children .
In Prague Chinaski , for example , to support , with Dan Lesbiens Illustratosphere Bárta The Tap Tap , Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý .
All you will be further www.kpks.cz on the website .
Are similar 'events have also planned for the future ?
In May we come to the Prague Spring , for the first time , and also for this project , we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests .
next year , we also want to be held in New York in the Czech Parliament , and I personally - if we then in the United States , this would also have liked to have a link with interventions in Washington and Chicago .
your Auslandspläne are not just small , you have been so far in Madrid , London , Brussels or in Moscow .
The Tap Tap is , however , a group of people with disabilities .
How do you manage the logistical and organisational travel ?
It is not as bad as it appears at first sight .
Five of our members are wheelchair users , i.e . the Gepäckraum transported in wheelchairs , we must also , of course , many Instrumentenkoffer must haul and luggage ...
Nevertheless it has worked to date without its problems , and British Airways ČSA were always prepared to us very well that I have already partly I am sometimes surprised .
Even in Moscow , where we were recently , there were no problems .
Indeed , you have your travel as a comparison , in the various countries with accessibility is , how it is dealing with disabled people , etc .
As you have seen these things ?
After Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other towns and cities where everything works better than us in Russia , we have just seen that in the East , everything is still in its infancy .
confrontation Prague Moscow is absolutely not accessible , it is still unusually , if someone using a wheelchair , is alone in the city centre .
It is not , of course , that we have a wheelchair users in the lift vorlässt , for example .
terms Fortunately , there are also the clubs try to address the problems of people with disabilities .
And in what ways we have to catch up with the more developed countries ?
There are still many issues where we are lagging behind .
The same applies , that is an improvement but it also depends on the situation and the efforts of the people concerned .
In London and Madrid it is perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities are self - employed in the public sphere , museum , use the toilets can move , etc .
It is not just that there is a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in the public arena , we are ahead with the band The Tap Tap the West is a little .
is public respect - and one thing , but only when a change from the ranks of the important things are really start , athletes , artists and actors , to be politicians or lawyers .
So far these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken figures .
The Tap Tap is currently very popular , however . If we go back a couple of years , is motivated to you : What has happened in 1998 , to set up a bond ?
I went to Damals Jedlička as carers , the Institute , where I met many young people who were keen to deal with something .
And since I myself am a Musik-AG Saxofon and musicians and I have established , together with a colleague .
Na , and in time , that is , as our facilitator , Láďa Angelovič , tends to say , somewhat out of control ( laughs ) .
Volume Bekannt but which was only in recent years , or are we not ?
It is true that the cooperation with also well - known Sängern we have started to have also helped ; actively for us .
We are aware of the fact that it has become rather , and this is not to see the merit , in some sense , does not exist .
Thanks to the EU , we can make our good teachers and high - quality products , and so on .
War , it aims to get it with The Tap Tap ?
From the start , I have heard the potential that we can tackle the situation is different .
In the branch of show business today that is often one of the other .
This is logical , on its way with caution , because anything new only after a long time , and will be accepted .
There are only a few things that are truly unique and , I would venture to claim that Tap Tap is one of them .
The first impression that the public has often , there is , of course , and this is only natural .
But this sympathy is totally superfluous , because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned we would regret that .
There are people who live a full life and can develop , if they have the necessary resources .
I always say that if people with disabilities , something that is not only to themselves is a step forward , but for the whole of society .
War for this success is also useful that you are strictly a head , as we heard from many people ?
If you want to make something good , we should not make any compromises on many things , and must also demand a certain degree of discipline .
This is , I think , but completely normal .
Some come to us with a romantic ideas , and then , when they see that they have twice a week , to undertake stages and spend a lot of time on the enthusiasm , sponsoring concert tours then many of them quickly .
This is how it works but everywhere , in every bond , the serious work and wants to achieve something .
A The Tap Tap has twenty members .
How many of them were from the outset , namely that since 1998 ?
Just one : Láďa Angelovič .
We are an open group . The people come and go . The one can prevent .
Who has the will and the desire to contribute , is always welcome .
region instead of the day before the statements of the projected 20.12.2012 , Thursday at 9 p.m .
venues , are : Incheba-Arena/Prag Fléda / Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava ; 12 Czech bands and further musicians
All three venues be linked to the end and to overcome it by Live-Schaltung from a common interpretation of the anthem 'statements of the bond is ' The Tap Tap .

The most difficult jobs in the world : the human Arbeitstiere of Kawah Ijen
For the four euro of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they are 70 kilos of sulphur , the steep , stony path .
There are people , for their work , the hell is literally , and other work in hell .
This is the case with Anto Wijaya , one of the 400 Minenarbeiter who deserve to get their lives by sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java .
The same applies to it every day on the ground down his Kraters increase in the world where the gas ausströmende schwefelhaltige stuck in contact with the air .
Given the major Schwefelsteine it undermined as a whole can weigh up to 70 kilos , he has moved it in two Bambuskörben on its shoulders further about the blocking of stone .
It only 250 metres and the head of the volcano , up to a level of 2386 metres , but the exhausted media need more than 40 minutes for the rise in Schildkrötentempo , while keeping the balance and cautious steps to take place , so that they do not slip and crash .
You know that every step their lives , it can cost as a French Touristin happened a few years ago , the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen tonne .
The Minenarbeiter of Kawah Ijen five cents deserve every kilo of sulphur , for it .
Oben , it is clear the path between the tourists Zirkusaffen they are taking and tedious serious baskets with the three kilometres to the balance , which established a Minengesellschaft a little further down a EUR 1 850 metre has

For every line he needs three hours , which is completely achieved at the end of the day , but then he has 138.000 Rupien ( 11.5 euro ) .
What a poor pay for such an almost superhuman effort , which is three times what it was in the fields .
'The Tagelohn the Minenarbeiter here , where the Kaffeeernte paid Rupien 15 000 ( EUR 1 a day and the average monthly Rupien two million ( EUR 167 , is very high , the agencies ' explained previously as bricklayers on the tourist island of Bali .
which he deserved Rupien 75 000 ( EUR 6.2 the day , and the work has not been so hard , but Anto has returned after Banyuwangi with his family , a village near , and that for a reason that in Indonesia as important as the sulphur is : 'I have married a girl from Bali , where Hindus , they are , and I have brought with them after Java converting to Islam ' .
Anto has an asthma , with difficulty , coughs and its eyes are a temptation often because of the toxic gases .
The 27 jährige Anto , for three years of his life is at stake on Kawah Ijen sulphur in which he has already left the first evidence , although it covers his face with a pretext and Spezialbrille .

The MVRDV architects to prove that the real spirit of adventure are not only in mind the example of Spijkenisse and the newly - created Bücherberg - 2 photographs
'I find this building for a ride , there is much futuristic and finally we have to see ' interestingly Lisette Verhaig says that a roadside Passantin .
And , Stefan Spermon IT-Techniker in a nearby factories , says : `` However , it is good that the House .
But I do wonder what we need today is a library .
All Internet and electronic books , iPad .
No one is still in a Old-Style-Bibliotheken this ?
Spijkenisse besichtigungsbedürftige Schlafstadt a little at the gates of Rotterdam outlandish is record holder .
The 80.000-Einwohner-Gemeinde on the lowest education rates of the whole of the Netherlands .
In order to counter this stupid fact , it was decided a couple of years ago , to education and to contribute as nachzubauen the seven fictitious bridges , which are pretty Euroscheinen , bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen .
The success of the was based .
And so the Stadtväter realised that there be to the statistics , there is only one way to a library ago .
Winy Maas of Rotterdam Architekturbüro MVRDV , a master of tollkühnen Balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen , and often the cynical buildings , with his usual calmness and appeared for the Wettbewerbs-Hearing in 2003 , with five books at the arm and an easy snigger in the face .
And while the jury verdutzt still looked at and with our armpits zuckte the impudent stapelte Meuse , its splendid Mitbringsel according to the size of a pyramid aktionistisch well - founded and ended his speech by saying : ' love Stadtgemeinde ! '
It is , therefore , my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse , for the so - called Boekenberg .
Nine really do represent years later the EUR 30 million aufgeschüttet Berg is expensive .
He is part of an underground car park Revitalisierungsprojekts to the supermarket , postal services , and a few neighbouring housing and Reihenhäuser with a total of 50 homes .
Bücherberg at the beginning of November , was the second prize awarded the 'Best Library of NL 2012 ' .
2012 : the project has been nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award .
That the faceless Kleinstadtretorte is not , to date , have been more to offer than a post - modern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly town hall , behind its white façades we would be inclined to assume a Molkereifabrik , a bit rich to contemporary architecture .
Above all , however , Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence .
The long way to book
The first impression : under glass Büchereldorado .
There is a lift the depths of our most mountainous areas through , but the real area and Lesefreuden develop fußläufigen in climbing the topography .
The totally verglaste Innenraum is bright , and the eventual gebrannte Klinkerboden and elegant street lamps clearly speak the language of a public Stadtplatzes .
The urban atmosphere is perfect .
Man has already looking for Parkbank , dogs and playing football Mädels and boys .
And all books , books , books .
'which are normally Bücherregale along the façade , and in the centre of a large , dark area , which is usually unpersönlich things and Meuse Winy ' .
We have asked and the traditional Raumkonfiguration on the head of the top Lesebereich internally and externally .
The Home of Bücherbergs is skilfully used : In the mid - Office , that , and Internet library Schachclub Haustechnikzentrale environment centre .
A black Bücherregale are special pleasure that , once again , Wandverkleidung Brüstung Stiegengeländer are .
optics , are Haptik and smell .
Even committed architects of Civil Engineers and shake unknown Baustoffs the head .
'We wanted to work here with Recycling-Materialien Trouborst Joop , '' declared in the project manager Stadtgemeinde Spijkenisse , at the request of the standard .
And so we have encountered in a friesländischen holding a fitting one day become waste from agriculture .
For years we have in the Netherlands in greenhouses and in fields as a millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies Wurzelunterlage .
That is cheap and zeiteffizient .
The textile , lacking a two Saisonen , it is then Sperrmüll ripe for this .
The library thick records fleece carried the first time - has been squeezed in these quantities are four - inch .
Under pressure from Hitzeeinwirkung and the so - called Landbouwplastic verfärbt ( KLP ) to a dark , coherent , belastungsfähigen material which smacks of a bissl for new cars and a bissl Sportschuh after .
After 105 stages of the summit is to be reached .
At the end of the almost 500 metres long used will be rewarded in Literaturcafé not only with a fantastic prospect of the city , but also with Dutch Kroketten and eingetopften Ficusbäumen .
by atmosphere , but above all for the right Luftfeuchtigkeit Literaturgebirge in .
donations for the new soul
'You would not think so , but this House , despite the many Glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology , Trouborst says .
Geheizt and cooling is with geothermal energy .
Although the Bücherberg Glassturz under the sun shines , sunny days is actually just interior .
The broad Holzleimbinder , the right to be outside glass serve as Beschattung catch and a large proportion of the sun .
The Raumklima is very pleasant .
The rest fully automated Rollos do .
Stefan Spermon , the initial scepticism from the digital sector , already made its way into the new library .
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there .
And also the TCM-Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde , which even Spijkenisses Boekenberg termed the 'long overdue soul ' .
The reason : The opening of all inhabitants of a few weeks ago , was invited to donate a book from his own stocks .
Therefore , for the time being , to be filled the optical gaps are not yet fully - stocked in the library , 70 000 of them - at the moment .
The concept is clear .
The shelves are filled by obenhin .
'There is nothing worse than a half - empty library ' , architect Winy Maas says .
'I think that , thanks to our invitation of the inhabitants , has a kind of relationship with this House .
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building .
And if it is only to grace .
That MVRDV Königsdisziplin those who have called in the jargon preserving identity .
Spijkenisse Literaturgeschichte has written .
There are young and uneducated they may be .
It is high time a starting point for identity .

Rakfisk from Norway : Is the übelriechendste fish in the world ?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest standard of living - and not only in Europe but throughout the world .
If the secret of the success of the country to do with the local appetite for rather nasty smelling fish ?
We note a selection überreifer cheese .
We are in the midst of a crowd platziere they are dirtier feuchter Sportkleidung .
And they leave that a week .
That is roughly we must envisage nasenbetäubenden the smell of Rakfisk , one of the major be delicacies Norway .
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes , about three hours of Oslo .
There are here , snow spectacular landscapes and this persistent smell in the air , which does not simply disappear .
Rakfisk with salt bestreute trout , depending on how we would like - stinkend its fish up to a year in water will ferments .
If in Norway the darkness of the country and the Norwegians are a weather will become colder Fagernes , now , that this is really very 's speciality .
'You are eating raw and carries it down with a glass of Aquavit ' Havard Halvarsen says , which is actually in the local fire station is working , but , as so - called 'Rakfisk-General ' is also organising the festival .
If people consume around us Fischwürfel to small and large quantities of alcohol .
'Mansche people Aquavit the more as the Rakfisk Havard says ' .
The spirit can replace the smell .
In some Häppchen cost .
If we are to get the Rakfisk Nasennähe avoids , in that it is not a bad thing , for example , how sushi has a rather lengthy bus .
Rakfisk is the product of a quite different , much poorer Norwegian era , when there were no thing and fish in the autumn in luftdichten Salzwasserfässern was watered .
The deepest winters he has been removed and then after a long , under fermentation using alcohol consumed gedämpften - end .
On a generation of thousands of Norway in search of work were forced to leave their country and from wanderten mainly in the United States .
Today , the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by a prosperous labour market , high wages and a comprehensive health care .
Even from Sweden , the old rivals , it was not so long ago was much richer as Norway , are immigrants .
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential if strict riechender part of the Norwegian history .
He is one of the more expensive courts , which it is possible to buy .
But here , of course , everything is expensive - a little glass of beer or a sandwich Euro impressive 10 costs .
Norway , it is not often in the world press , and most people there do not seem to be upset .
Here we have to call it hates , Anders Breivik - racist extreme right of those who , in the last year of the 77 shot men , women and children .
Stattdessen it relates only to the 'incident of 22 Juli ' .
Norwegian do find it difficult to accept that someone in their peaceful country to such brutal murders is capable .
has Hauptverantwortlich for today 's wealth of Norway the early 1970s , the growth of the biggest oil and Gasindustrien the world .
`` But oil is not the only reason why we are so well off 'Anna says that our waitresses , distributed and round - trays reifem with Rakfisk with its long and the hair blonde stechend blue eyes represents the Nordic model .
We are one - as they say - the people .
Your English is just as the measures which most people here .
We are not very angeberisch Prahlerei , we do not like .
Norway is handled very carefully , with its oil wealth , a large part of the Branchenerträge for the benefit of future generations will be invested in a special fund .
As in all the years leading up to the global economic crisis , with money that they had not even in its pocket stones , Norway has firmly closed .
'As long as we in the winter of ski everywhere and in the summer , we are happy to be able to go ' Anna says .
'and ' eat Rakfisk , of course , it also adds unbeschwertem with laughter .
I am pleased to note the snow and for another court - of Rakfisk I have enough .
That is in any case a Elch-Burger is something quite different . The huge enjoy meat .
But in the evening of Stinkefisch is once again on our menu .
The hotel , where I logiere is one of several Veranstaltungsorten , to organise a Rakfisk-Dinner the guests for the best , or perhaps the most challenging Geruchssinne - fish can vote .
There is a Live-TV-Schaltung of a bird Showmaster there were , which is surrounded by Rakfisk tables .
The spectacle is like the Eurovision Song Contest .
What than those of their 'as you were up in the mountains , for the best fish Thor-J ? '
'There are our points Havard ' .
Man and laughing klatscht .
A man of his seat , is perhaps overwhelmed by Aquavit .
But perhaps it is the strict cloud of all the fish .

directives for the Aufblasen by balloons , for bananas and for the circus
The servers www.bankovnipoplatky.com devoted every year , a survey on the oddest of bank charges , has decided to organise this year , the competition 'Absurdeste regulation , or EU-Werkstatt idea from the ' .
'At this notion of the recently put forward by the EU 's ' plan to introduce a 40 % quota of female representation in the management of large European companies , Patrik Nacher said , the organisation of this survey , to the newspaper Právo .
Under the nominated aberrations , for example , the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the standardisation of Versicherungstarife for men and women .
In the meantime , on life assurance women enjoyed an advantage for the insurance companies , because they constitute a lower risk of objectively .
'Another incredible incursions from the EU-Werkstatt can be nominated by the end of this year .
The actual vote will take place by the end of February , with shared Nacher 2013 ' .
On the controversial regulations including the mandatory admixture of bioethanol heard on fuels , the result is naturschädigend , the further the ban on mercury thermometers reliable , because it contains only a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes or , the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen this year , because of the eggs have been much more expensive .

The EU machine often decide under pressure from this or that lobby from trade and industry , whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more Member States are represented , such as the Czech Republic is currently trying to impose Veto-Drohung with the demands of Czech banks .
Lobby-Interessen were also behind this that bananas Handelsklasse the highest in the EU must be for at least 14 cm Krümmungsanomalie 'and not ' levels .
The European Commission is defended with the argument that they simply harmonisiere the fragmented national standards that would hinder the trade .
The standards for fruit and vegetables has been watered down by the EU against the opposition of some countries already with the comment that the existing directives are a waste of food .
A candidate for the victory in this survey the EU regulation is perhaps the past year , in accordance with balloons the sale to the fact that children under the age of eight Luftballon not without the supervision of an adult aufblasen must .
The EU therefore , in relation to an American study in accordance with balloons leading the cause of the suffocation of children .

Relativ a directive is also absurd , which affects each European officials in the EU is an official capacity , should say , because of the sensitivity of the issue of the name Macedonia for Greece and must instead use FYROM ( Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
The Bankovnípoplatky server . com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Toward fair in addition to the above - mentioned absurdities the EU Regulation on the volume of food supplies on the territory of a Member State .
The EU established the Höchstvolumen of food supplies , which is on the day of our accession to the European Union in the field of the Czech Republic are allowed .
exceeded the Czech Republic , for example , then , the volume of which we have threatened Pilzkonserven for a large fine .
The organisers of the survey was also struck by the idea that certain countries receive the money that they have no sea , or should , however , the idea of funding for applications for aid .
These ideas , of course , come not from Brussels , but from Prague .
'We are put at a disadvantage that we do not have a sea .
We will ask for a refund from the EU , the then Minister of Agriculture in the autumn of 2004 , Jaroslav Palas ( ČSSD ) .
The argument of the harvest that was very high , and the result of the so - called state camps were overcrowded Interventionseinkäufe .
Since the Czech Republic a further path to sea ports , the EU should have to pay the Palas hundreds of millions of euros in us .
The European Commission , in the Czech Republic , so that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea .

Bizarre EU regulations are the exception .
Regulations are in the Member States is easy to the target of criticism , the efforts of the EU to regulate and effective and development of the whole European Union , according to some experts .
There are serious problem of funding this expert opinion of the EU funds for projects , which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration , however , that during the budget negotiations have been forced by individual Member States .
feelings here is also the fact that the Czech Republic as other Member States in Brussels about the right to use specific indications and traditional products have to fight this fight is not always wins .
the Czech Republic had been able to fight for a six - year with Germany and Austria defend the term 'Olomoucké tvarůžky ' Inländerrum ( Tuzemský ) , of which we have a tradition of dates back to the 19th century , our producers , however , have to rename the 'in ' Tuzemák .
The term 'rum must only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat , not for products made from sugar beet .

'PSG is not the moment Barcelona ! '
In this season PSG you have adopted with a new scale .
How do you explain this progress ?
You can say it with a personal view , but also by the new dimension of PSG .
significance are players .
Täglich I make progress on their side .
The technical staff has also been much .
These elements to spur me to do this on a daily basis , to improve my Spielniveau .
And in a game that is simpler than that .
In football everything is very quickly .
But I am not from breche in enthusiasm .
Since my earliest days of the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my Spielzeit in gradually Saint-Etienne I have always made progress .
you by Carlo Ancelotti therefore compete with imported from ...
The addition of this summer are used to the Olympics , with a very high level .
you also know that any Trainingseinheit is crucial .
This means that a player , as I must be inventive and its very best wishes .
Carlo Ancelotti main issues here have much to me in relation to my Spielposition .
He is supported by Co-Trainern as Claude Makelele , as I was in the same position .
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job ?
Of course .
Ancelotti a cause for all the technicians respect .
In the Ligue 1 , there is currently no comparable person , and it is one of the best trainers of Europe .
He will look back on a rich experience and has won many title with eminent clubs .
He had contact with major players .
I think that it will be further title in Paris .
In January , I had a good discussion with him .
Damals I had just recovering from a Verletzungsserie .
The confidence that he has placed in me , is also an explanation of my services .
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG ?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the Spitzenreiters us .
We lurk in ambush , however .
Champions League is one of our most important objectives : we have qualified for us in this way the Achtelfinale .
What is the aim of the club in this competition ?
We will try to come , as far as possible .
From now on , everything is possible .
But we are against a very good European crews to have our say .
First of all , we want to be the first of our group in Porto , so that we take the Achtelfinales Heimspiel as the return leg .
Will the PSG be in the short term , a great European club ?
He has already for the budget .
For Europe to be a big club , must gain and Paris is entitled to make a name for the long term .
This is not the case today .
Finanziell PSG of the funds so that this project takes concrete forms .
Would it not be a big failure to win the title in the Ligue 1 , as in the last season was the case ?
Of course this would be a great disappointment .
This year it is truly committed to cream off , this title .
In the last season we were close off .
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to embrace the victory .
We have reached the end of the season , with a very significant achievement .
We have concluded with 79 points .
should normally be master with 79 points ...
However , those of another team , has achieved a better season .
I believe that this is the right one .
Even if the big teams like Marseilles I believe - Lyon - Bordeaux or the stuff that we have to gain the title , struggling
thinking that the media , you expect too much from the PSG ?
In view of what has been spent and the players that we have , it is normal that much is expected of us .
We accept that .
If , however , we are against a Heimspiel Troyes 4-0 , and it is still what we have to do something , we can say with certainty , which is somewhat frustrating .
One wonders what the people expect .
We can never win every weekend 4-0 with .
We are not the moment Barcelona .
We are trying to set an Spielkonzept .
A team building at the time .
In the Champions League , we have demonstrated our strength .
Manchester City looking to you , a combination of the two Saisons unable , to qualify for the Achtelfinale , and has also made huge expenditure .
In view of the sums invested it was believed you to Spielpause ahead with 15 points .
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would ignore .
Lyon and Marseilles , the last season was not good geboostet 'of this new PSG ' .
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting .
I hope that we , in the month of May will be the winner smiling and tell us that we finally , they have gained , despite all the difficulties .
The PSG seems to be completely Zlatan Ibrahimovic of the services provided .
In order that it better Zlatan-Abh 'independence ' .
That means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and too many goals .
And he has come and it shows that it is the 'Star the Ligue 1 .
Überall where he has played , it has led to great a player and that he is a world star with respect .
Within the team we respect both the players and the person .
He also respect the people who surround it .
What he has done is exceptional .
This helps to improve their Spielniveau the others .
Thiago Silva , the world is one of the best defenders , will make it possible for all the others , also to make progress .
As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French team ?
As a disappointment .
It was very important to me , to the Euro .
Unfortunately my violation has also prevented Spielzeit something .
I saw things that emerged strengthened from which I am .
Today , we will be able to achieve good Games in the national football team .
This has , since I had with the 'Bleus ' my hope .
From what has happened in Ukraine , we have learned our lesson , and today we must behave in an exemplary manner in the day .
What do you have to consider the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the 'Bleus ' ?
He has achieved positive results .
We have a good position in the Qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup .
The Austrian national coach is strictly , is close to the players and encourages on his victory .
As it was also Laurent Blanc tragedy .
But I do not want to make any comparison .
Blanc has to be achieved by giving us for the Euro was qualified .
I hope that the 'Deschamps Didier Bleus ' will lead to Brazil .
Stellt that on 16 October in Spain in a forced latched Auftaktspiel ( 1:1 ) ?
This game has given us confidence .
Everyone has worked for all the others .
Before this meeting in Spain , I have never seen a similar line in my career .

We are deducted from Afghanistan .
And then ?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan ( Kapisa and Surobi ) .
The NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014 .
It is time that the Afghan army , once again , to take ownership of their territory and that the Afghan people to decide their future , without anything to expect from us .
We have to be punished by the Afghan farmers in particular , we have seen them as terrorists .
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers who have been killed and injured and Versehrten .
The Taliban are from foreign extremists , former leaders who fled to Pakistan , but often also for farmers , who refuse to armed foreign presence , as at the time of the Soviets .
you want to defend their centuries - old and archaic traditions , although jihadis , Pakistanis , Arabs , Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them .
the latter will not be more Toleriert , sometimes because of the local insurgents supported , if the western countries are renowned .

you have turned into businessmen , land seized by the government , in order to sell and took them as housing development of refugees from Iran and Pakistan so benefit from the huge American of subcontracting .
you have brought into disrepute , and most of them were not involved in the fighting .
As I have heard it in the campaigns , the people want a government that is not made up of thieves .
Many young people are leaving the country , as those who make the American support to the flight of capital that is significant .
The young people have had enough of the war and its ideologies .
During their exile in Iran and Pakistan have they had contact with the modern world , and have enjoyed the benefits .
Approximately 65 % of the population is under 25 years ; Kabul now has a population of 5 million , which is one - fifth of the population .
In the cities , the state schools are full of girls and boys .

With regard to the authorities , under whose authority they will be as legitimate ?
Former commanders of the anti- Soviet war are already making efforts to restore the militias in the province , which will be the power of the central government .
Afghanistan , the land of mountains with strong local identities would have a certain degree of decentralisation of the example of the Western nations are to benefit , but through the abolition of the office of the Prime Minister , since the 1964 constitution of the United States wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt .
President Karzai not foreign to controls , in particular at the elections planned for April in 2014 .
But his country since the 1950s and is already long dependent on outside aid .
industries have not been rebuilt , viable Stauwerke are not there and important irrigation systems have not been repaired .
Everything is imported , apart from fruit and vegetables is nothing .
The private initiative is the priority .
In a country which has been ruined by 30 years of war , a state control would be the infrastructure needed .
The rumour circulated that Afghanistan has had enormous natural resources .
This reinforces the impression that the western countries , whose only in order to conquer space .
Without energy , to digest the iron or Kupfererz on the ground without transport , or for the export of the mountains of mining is not possible .
The Chinese have already almost leave the copper mine , the international Aynak Mes of archaeologists ( be financed by the World Bank on the huge Buddhist place their archaeological excavation team and the main employer remain the province .
One day , it will be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , which largely imports and exports are subject to establish normal relations .

Palliativpflege - the best way to Le Devoir death ...
With its Committee on 'dignity ' death in Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of Lebensendes .
The debate must be included in the near future , although a bill is prepared .
But , to do much more in this important area .
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely .
A few weeks ago , Mr L. still living in his home in the Montérégie .
The prostate cancer , aufzehrte him , he was given a deadline of two years .
'you gave me to live five years , I have managed to seven years , he said ' half - hearted , in bed in the home for Palliativpflege Victor-Gadbois Beloeil in the sense in which he was reached on the previous day .
'But there is always a shock , it can not be prepared , it says ' .
The disease is doing its work , prevents any weakness , a vast to the toilet and even to go to eat .
On the table a leckeren lunch , he willigt to help a resigned itself to the Essen .
Mutig it even manage to smile and to talk to strangers , which employs around him , he and his medicines offer him a bad .
The courage of the ordinary .
'My it the greatest wish is that it heals my diarrhoea , as this is ' humiliating that he shares .
Some hours later found the team has a cure for this evil .
'In the course of our lives , we hear that a man in the foot , Pierre pinkelt Brodeur told ' psychologist Victor-Gadbois in the home .
In the Kindheitsphase is for certain persons to return to an intolerable humiliation .
'That depends on the ability of the person ' to accept it , is a retrograde step .
Because , according to the number of people working in the Palliativpflege great events are taking place in the midst of this step backwards .
The patients in the home for Palliativpflege Victor-Gadbois be admitted , are all suffering from cancer .
you have a maximum life expectancy of three months .
At this stage , they will be besieged by doctors and nurses , who look after them , not more so - called 'with ' curative care .
For Mrs A. , 89 years , is the worst fears of 'and ' by suffocation to die .
But by the disease , I have got to know my children .
'I have good children ' , there .
'I have no desire to be more in life , it says ' before they agreed to be a mask their side to it , will help to breathe .
awaits us in the next few days , a recent visit of her son , in Italy .
The home Victor-Gadbois to provide you with a group of varying volunteers and assistance in the food .
The Palliativpflege will be used if there are no other options .
In order to make the programme more pleasant .
The population of Quebec State on a bed Palliativpflege is .
That is when you take into account the very little that we will one day all will die .
Here the life will continue under the best possible conditions , Dr declared Christiane Martel , died of the doctors .
Both at the level of the physical , emotional or spiritual Komforts .
We wish the dying in a Mundpflege brandy or with what Pepsi .
The people must monitor their Blutzuckerspiegel not more .
And the death is part of everyday life .
Yesterday evening we have Mr X served a beer , who died in the course of the night .
This morning is his son austrinken beer at the foot of the deceased .
'We help patients ' families and equally , Nathalie Savard Pflegedirektorin reported .
The home Victor-Gadbois is not a day as the other .
Aside from an old man from 93 years , and the latest Familienzusammenkunft in the courtyard well supported by his pillow , while its honour to the issuing of a young man , woman dies from 36 years of his parents and his wife and his two small children , as he is in a tragic way to survive has tried everything .
'For six months ' three to five beds are always shown with cancer patients aged less than 45 years , shares with Dr Christiane Martel concerned .
53 % of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois home from their Wohnstätte , 47 % come from the hospital .
problem of access to Palliativpflege
The saying goes that 77 % of the Canadians have no access to Palliativpflege , in other words a care , to alleviate the suffering of patients , if the latter is to reach the final stages of their lives , both at home in hospital or in a they have .
And a number of organisations , such as the home Victor-Gadbois and society for domestic Palliativpflege specialise in the urban area of Montreal more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients .
It is this very lack of health care in Quebec ensures that several in the specialist doctors Palliativpflege look forward to the adoption of a law regulating of euthanasia assistiertem suicide and with concern .
Since the month of October a manifesto is in circulation , the prominent personalities as Dr Palliativpflege the Balfour Mount and Doctor Bernard Lapointe was signed in order to express their opposition to such an initiative .
Dr Christiane Martel Quebec , the health system is not effective enough to ensure that all the right to quality Palliativpflege before we accepted , on euthanasia .
Before long , it says that I have seen a patient , the 14 days with great pain in the emergency was taken without measures to alleviate .
I am afraid that the patients only because they do not receive adequate health care , want to die .
And at the same time , several oncologists , despite their patients are worst predictions stubbornly until the very last day .
The survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal , as it has an onerous chemotherapy suspended .
As I have indicated in my Onkologin that I will stop the treatment they replied that it abandons I regret that the battle , they told .
But she had told me that I was in the end .
No omnipotente care
Dr Martel believes that 90 % of patients who have asked to die , nurses , this desire that it has not been taken up , after their pain of a team of Palliativpflege have been arrested .
It must be said , however , the fact that palliative care has clearly the omnipotent Schmerzbehandlung is not .
After Elsie Monereau Palliativpflege , head of the society of the domestic Palliativpflege of Montreal 8 % of the patients are not on a Schmerzbehandlung .
Today , at the end of the life of the doctors who are often on the back , terminale Sedierung leading to the patients einzuschläfern sporadically or permanently either by the time of his death .
We can no longer do so , as if we do not take this side of the suffering .
patients without pain relief are going to be increasingly have the possibility to use these terminale Sedierung .
patients , not alleviate the pain , they all say the same thing : 'I want ' .
But that does not necessarily mean 'I will euthanise that you ' but 'I would like to see my ' to alleviate the pain .
The implementation of this report was possible because of a Canadian Gesundheitsforschungsinstitute Journalismusstipendiums .

Szabo : `` German greater role to play '
Germany has in the vote on the reception of Palestine .
According to expert , Stephen Szabo US-Europ - European relations , Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level .
firstly : Deutsche Welle indicated at the beginning of the week , as Germany , that it was against the application for observer status for the Palestinians would vote at the United Nations .
Then , however , contain Berlin .
Why ?
Stephen Szabo : Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have not done .
Now Germany must be given its special relationship with Israel , however , be careful .
But at the same time , I believe that it also does not support the American position .
Germany wanted to demonstrate to its independence , without , however , to be critical of Israel .
Throughout the uprising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany has also abstain , as it were , to establish a no - fly zone .
This was achieved by NATO .
Fällt it difficult on important international issues , Germany , to take a clear position ?
Yes , it is true .
The reason is that it has just been surrounded and its foreign policy away from a policy of the United States , as it were , to pay a German foreign policy .
Erschwerend that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform have added to this policy .
The Germans , that is , between the lines .
One of them is that they play a more independent role , but they are not used .
I believe that they are making are still in their role , but they are on the way to a more normal 'foreign policy ' .
A foreign policy , as they have in France or the United Kingdom .
What means a'n ormal 'foreign policy as from a German point of view ?
you shows the willingness to national interests , to adopt positions , which are independent of the United States or European partners .
I believe that the German foreign policy of economic policy , in other words by the exports and its relations with certain regions , such as Russia , China or the Middle East , is motivated .
Germany to protect economic interests to a certain extent , unlike the other major powers and Germany must therefore its interests .
Did they had economic impact on the attitude of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN ?
For Germany has a large markets in the Middle East , especially in the Gulf .
And we must be careful , the public , but also the elites , not only in the Arab countries .
This is definitely a role .
But I would not want to attach a great deal of weight , that is not wholly unilateral relationship .
But it is definitely an important role in German considerations .
Where Germany damaged its relations with the United States , by the vote on major decisions such as the vote on Palestine has to contain ?
I believe in Europe , and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding for the German position .
And I do not believe that this is a just as in the Libyan question was more dramatic rift .
Maybe einspielen Germany will also ensure that even a certain respect .
Because it signals that it as an international players must be taken seriously and its interests .
There are different views in Europe to the Palestinian initiative .
The United States , have clearly in favour of a veto .
Are there any differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations ?
The American domestic affairs of these differences have always existed .
I believe that the government under President Obama has , without a great deal of understanding for the European position .
But because of the political situation is , of course , the government could not publicly supported that position .
I believe that the real differences of opinion as it always does not seem to be so great .
If you look at the relationship between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama , President Obama is not so enthusiastic about taken by Netanyahu hellauf policy .
Fällt Germany it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States , on the one hand , and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side ?
I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans .
It would , of course , be a little easier for the Germans , if it were a coherent and unified European policy , which is currently not the case .
So they will not be part of a broader approach and we must instead push things from their own point of view .
The make it is with the euro .
I believe that Germany will in future play a leading role , to urge Europe to a European position .
That is , of course , not just to Germany , because the relationship with Israel .
That has always been a sensitive issue .
But I believe that is the German clear that they play a more independent role .
Sieht even in Germany 's role as an important international players - Germany wants to play a leading role at all ?
Oder , Germany is still difficult for the leadership role ?
Germany is still not being used , it is embarrassing and , for obvious reasons , it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role .
If we look at the example of the euro crisis , because each time when Germany , adopts a greater role , various anti-deutsche feelings .
It is not just the Germans .
That is actually the old problem : you want to be surrounded by hostile countries .
Germany However , in a far worse position than the United States .
It must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions and it is not easy .
Well , the influence of the United States is continuously in European policy , the EU does not , for the moment , this vacuum , who is otherwise ?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role .
Even if they do not like it , and a lot of them is an unpleasant unpopular , c ' est la vie it !

global warming or clash with Killerasteroid .
Karawanen of spacecraft Erdbewohnern to make on board to the quest for a spare planet .
In order to save the human race , the important question of how we can or zero gravity to reproduce a spare planet ?
Many choice is not in my opinion .
De facto there are only two real planet , we could at least on a hypothetical .
'Nämlich Mars and Venus ' , says the scientific staff of Vladimir Surdin Astronomischen Sternberg-Instituts .
During the conditions on the surface to Mars are comparatively lebensfreundlich the Venus , a temperature of 500 level .
life would be only in large level or within the orbit of Venus , therefore , possible in space .
The issue of the researchers in space first discussed in terms of the flora .
Right carried out half a century before that experiments have to plants .
The fourth generation of the in - orbit peas was bred not in the slightest by the irdischen species .
It followed the breeding of insects , in greater detail by tiny Fruchtfliegen ( Drosophila ) in orbit .
In 1979 Wachteleier have been sent out into , in order to explore how the zero gravity has an impact on the development of embryos .
It is a normal chicks .
However , this problem .
'The problem is that the chicks find must stop ; it must be able to stand on its own feet and start to get ' Laborleiter explained , the Institute for medizinisch-biologische RAN problems , Vladimir Sychew .
Without solid ground when the wild , chicks .
Ten hours later , the instincts of the newborn stumpften from complete .
The chicks Laute and not reacting to light .
Four days later , be they died .
'Zweimal we have made a slip chicks and then see the whole thing , because it considers them Sychew Vladimir with the ' experiment has failed to work with , chicks in space is simply impossible .
The last Brutkäfig with animals flew into orbit , 16 years ago .
In spring 2013 to the experiments be continued .
Jedoch Biosatelliten on the 'only ' Bion of the same sex are species are .
There was an experiment with rats fertilised already sent into space .
( DE ) In principle , it has been said here .
'It was precisely with the Biosatelliten , but once again it was only a single experiment , and research must be continued , Vladimir Sychew .
After the landing Weltraumratten got the offspring .
The problem was directly in the space of one has not yet been resolved .
The task is a difficult one .
animals that are taken from their natural habitats , can follow their Fortpflanzungstrieb not .
In contrast to the individual animals may in principle .
The Homo sapiens abstraktem is capable of thinking and to produce a similar emotional tide .
There are ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments .
However , women to fly into space for 50 years .
, Tereschkowa The greatest risk .
The Wertvollste that the human race has is the female body .
Our Möwe plane , and no one in the world should have been able to answer the following question : they Übersteht the Weltraumflug ?
Will it , after this flight can bring a child into the world ?
Lastly , no 'answered this question ' Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse says .
In June in 1964 , just one year after its Weltraumflug result , the first female Kosmonautin Valentina Tereschkowa , a girl .
The child 's father , Andrijan Nikolajew , was also Kosmonaut .
In 1988 result if the second in space , Svetlana Sawizkaja who was twice in - orbit and even work outside the Raumfahrzeugs a son .
Even so the risk remains .
We have only very few Kosmonauten , after long flights and they got was all very healthy new blood .
`` The more , the dangerous , even on flights into orbit ' , Kosmonaut concludes Valeryi Poljakow hero , hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation .
And yet the humanity needs to find new methods in the field of biotechnology , the artificial radiation protection and the Erzeugen Gravitation .
The Hydrolabor Vorbereitungszentrum in the Kosmonauten is a compulsory stage during the ground .
Here in a state of flux the routine Kosmonauten gain for the work in the open space .
The water is zero gravity of the problem .
Even if adults water as a pleasant feel it is a strange surroundings ; but babies are water as a natural element .
It is the small Ichtyander would testify to the life of the country is turning the ocean .
There is a connection between the fact that a child in approximately nine months in the mother Fruchtwasser , and that it will then be easier to get used to water .
In principle it is logical , as from the cradle to the first to go swimming just two weeks ago .
'That is too little time to forget ' Babyschwimmlehrerin says something , Marina Aksenowa .
As for a new - born baby the zero gravity natürlicherer so much from a woman is the state of affairs is not defied without .
In the state of the zero gravity back the gut Beckenmuskulatur and very quickly , and it is therefore also the ability to extract the child .
All right , we deal with geburtseinleitende tool .
The birth could take place , for example , in a Spezialkammer to extract the child .
`` But what happens ? ' , which is no insignificant matter of Valeryi Poljakow .
Andererseits the child needs also defied artificial .
Without the Erdanziehung , to feel the body can train the skeleton and muscles .
A new - born child could be set as an adult in - orbit to train in a Belastungsanzug .
he simply lack the will for his life , which is of fundamental importance .
'This experiment which we jointly , namely the birth of a child in a strange environment , will mean that we have an entirely unangepassten a disabled people in the world ' , says , the director of the institute for Bioethikkommission medizinisch-biologische , Igor Pestow RAN problems .
No the birth of children in outer space is merely a theory .
Irgendwann however , it is a reality if the people in their spacecraft a distant planet is the home of the space for their offspring born heading .

'protection of trademarks ' in China : If Puma Armani and a sudden the Chinese
Armani is a world - renowned , Ralph Polo Lauren .
What Armani Polo is this ?
Dahinter a quite officially registered designation in China , but it is nothing to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen .
they work for so long as the actual protection regime not complain about .
And even then it is not clear whether the law .
`` It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brand 'in China , Thomas Pattloch says that a lawyer in the sessional services to Schutzrechtsverletzungen Wessing Taylor , which specialises in the Far East .
Every week , a new case , ends up on my desk .
The Nachahmern a few additional letter , so that they can express their brands .
However , will sign Lu-Gucci power instead of simply Prada Prada-Kny it is .
Even German companies are legally copied in this way , for example , the sports goods manufacturers Puma .
Pattloch opens with a raft of registration of the Community Trade Mark Office in Beijing .
On 14 September 2010 was a Chinese company protect trademarks , a somewhat Zegna DF Puma , which is also the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna used .
The fact that the Chinese are known champion in copying and the injured intellectual property .
In the big cities are mehrstöckige department , the almost exclusively to sell counterfeiting .
Pattlochs cases but are different : On behalf of his client , however , it is the case that Chinese companies are quite officially received the right to use a term which is already protected , elsewhere .
The Chinese call this ' Mingpai bang ' , a Beifahrermarke .
That word is ' Dakuan bang ' .
It is women who are rich men fishing .
The Chinese authorities are well aware of any blame
'That is , we must combat geschäftsschädigend Pattloch ' .
`` watered down , will mark the Alleinstellung disappear , the 'Imageschaden is enormous .
The financial losses Prozesskosten of the industries concerned and which run into millions , especially where expensive Vorzeigeprodukten .
After the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA China is with a budget of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest - growing .
However , the dubious entries Löschungen Markenregister are difficult to achieve and go into money .
Until the procedure to nine years is dragging on , with an uncertain end .
Pattloch reporting of cases in which the court complaints about the effort , because the name 'after ' reality is the long term .
If the plaintiff have the misfortune of having to pay , Plagiator even money , because its brand Pattloch violated in China .
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here .
Berühmte cases also affect graphic elements .
Daimler lost in 2009 a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany , that businesses , which recently took the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister .
The Chinese must therefore use until now , a symbol which resembles Mercedes-Stern .
The Volvo-K äufer Geely one originally used blau-wei emissions logo of BMW , reminded us , the dispute was resolved Geely , had to change it .
The Modehersteller Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore , which would ensure the famous crocodile in the other direction .
The Chinese authorities are well aware of any blame .
The case to CTMO in Beijing is true that there are low 2010 staff and have better facilities were bottlenecks .
Last year it was returned from the 'but ' emergency situation in business to normality .
However the stock is unbearbeiteter appeals fell by 22 % .
Almost 57.000 such cases we have been completed , 75 % more than in the previous year .
yet still in office 81.500 objections are awaiting execution .
However much it costs to tackle
As so often in China , the figures are impressive .
Last year , 1.4 million more than the CTMO requests received on protection of trademarks , almost a third more than 2010 .
This is a record and means that China and for the tenth time , the list of consecutive Neuanmeldungen in the world , to quote the authority .
This applies also to the stock of all the existing brands , 5.5 million as a whole .
1.8 billion in 2011 are yuan charges have been taken .
Vereinfacht which means that any notification 1280 yuan and the average cost of EUR 160 .
However , as a cost to the case of the German family firm Freudenberg .
For more than seven years ago , the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator .
While the Germans were able to ensure that its illegal production Kraftfahrzeugteile imitation has been exposed .
However , the more the Chinese rights secured to the brand Freudenberg .
You have failed to do that in Germany , because family names , could not be protected , Hanno Wentzler says , the chairman of the management of Chemical Freudenberg Specialities in Munich .
The case was CTMO back the appeal of the Munich .
Over the next two bodies , while Freudenberg received , but fighting Prozessgegner further until today .
We must be extremely careful
Now the issue is before the Supreme Court .
Wentzler is confident to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts .
But he also says : ' The procedure is extremely expensive and will cost us a great deal of time , money and nerves ' .
The internal costs are difficult to quantify , which leaves Firmenarchiv have even one hundred years old files , to provide proof .
Before Freudenberg five years on the other side of the House was in vain for a `` high Eurobetrag 'Decision on the resolution .
'Kultura we see how far it is worth us Wentzler says .
The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threatening to Europe .
Then , if there are unprotected imitators secure .
There was a Chinese manufacturers in Germany for the textile and leather shoes Freudenberg for .
This area of business of the company , but he has been able to prevent the registration .
'You must be careful not to say extremely Wentzler ' .
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch German companies to do business with China , to be very careful .
It is not enough in itself to international trademark rights , instead of leaving the foreigners or 'everything should somehow is worth protecting , including in China ' , as Wentzler says .
Sonst this can be much more expensive than the registration .
In fact , the case : Freudenberg last act of his Markendramas is , then we should pay the licence fees for the other party 's own behalf , Wentzler .
Oder we will be pushed out of the market in the sector in question .

says ' South America , the integration of the citizens ' learn , Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador , Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective and indeed 'South America can learn something from Europe ' .
Correa on 6 summit of the President of the Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) , which was held in Lima , explained to the public television in Peru , that the Europeans ' in the Second World War , and in other conflicts umbrachten 'and ' is now virtually a homeland are ' .
In this context , he defended the project to create a South American citizenship of Unasur the Member States .
'Erreicht must be the freedom of movement of citizens and workers in all the Latin American countries , as is the case in the Andean Community ; there are , however , still reactionary sectors ' seek a return to the past , he warned .
The President also Ecuador , the reorganisation of the Organisation of American States ( OEA ) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo - Saxon countries , and to take account of those who signed the San José Agreement on human rights .
The , which teach not commit themselves , and in return we sign the South Americans do everything and anything .
'It is incomprehensible that the interamerikanische Commission for Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and by the United States , as he said , is financed reference to ' the political asylum , Ecuador , the founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange , has granted .
Correa assured that they will not regret this decision , because it did not go back on its principles , but its ' deep democratic values and opinions on human rights ' .
He added that Assange to a third country with procedures would not be extradited and 'time , have well - founded suspicions
He also criticised the Swedish Justice , which have asked him to question him on its territory because of an alleged Sexualdelikts , while 'the Swedish case law it via a video conference which would have on the message of Ecuador in London said ' can be permitted .
Correa stated that the danger that the health and psychological state of Assange would be affected .
'Seitdem it is our message , I have not spoken to him , the ambassador , however , has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs , but no serious ' said Ecuador , the head of state .
It is , however , that the danger of physical and psychological damage , because he took in a narrow area is no physical exercise and caught out in the open air .
'This would affect the health of every people ' , he added .
Correa in that the solution to the asylum granted the Assange , since the month of June in the message of Ecuador in London , in which they can travel , Ecuador , the granting of a Freibriefs , and that this is in the hands of the United Kingdom , Sweden and the legal authorities ' s Europe . He emphasised that it with London in order to find a solution for the captive by Wikileaks founder had discussions .
We do not act with human rights , we appeal for this word in this case , however , there have been constant discussion .
'The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom , Sweden and the legal authorities , because Europe 's lawyer , Assange Baltazar Garzón , a certain number of procedures ' , he said on various European bodies .
And if the UK this carte blanche 'this morning is , in my opinion , done this . '
And if Mr Assange Sweden on the message of Ecuador in London or on verhörte Skype , as it allows the Swedish case - law and in other cases , the problem has to be dealt with .
Correa used the opportunity to confirm , as a defender of freedom of the press and said that , the sinister intention is a lie and what it is not to tolerate the mediocrity of the freedom of expression , the ' .
'The greatest enemies of freedom of the press is not the bad and perverse politicians , but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail ' , he said .
In this sense , we are happy that Ecuador of no more such journalists ' and not the bankers , or 'hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries and from the outset , that he was re - elected ' deepen the revolution in order to continue the way in the right direction ' .
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in of Unasur at least until the next elections , arguing that the 'body must remain firm and grant no opportunism as legal verkleideten coup d ' état and not ' because the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay 'has been destroyed by ' .
The President also Ecuador the desire of the Colombian Gegenübers , Juan Manuel Santos '' now , and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , the maritime bevorteilte the sovereignty of Nicaragua , to negotiate with Nicaragua seerechtlichen the border between the two countries ' for 'is absolutely justified .
At present it is not being implemented .
It is a problem between a Southern and a Central American country .
conflicts are inevitable , but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path .
you will have to be dealt with comprehensively and overcome them , so that we can look to the future .
Just he trusted to a good conclusion to the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile and before the Court of Justice stated that 'the international bodies , if both countries commit themselves to adopt , the judgment , even if it is very hard for Latin America is right '
In relation to the possibility of presenting itself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador , in order to achieve its third term in a result , it was in this way , that it 'with a lot of optimism and satisfaction , although it is sometimes very difficult to ' .
Correa assured that it will lose the elections in February 2013 , if he were to withdraw from political life .
power has never interested me personally , but under unfair conditions , such as in Ecuador be corrected these socio - economic poverty can only of political power .
'My political movement had the belief that I was there , the guarantee of the probable victory , therefore , I have this responsibility ' , he said .
If I should win it would be my last period when the President , then I am back from the public life .
This is also true when we lose .
'This is decided , he said ' .
Correa also to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela , Hugo Chávez , in Cuba .
I have spoken with the Vice - President of Venezuela , Nicolás Maduro . He has told me that he is a planned , routine treatment after the election campaign and again that he could travel to Cuba have visited , and that would have expected
'It is in any case a retreat of the state of health of President Chávez , commented on it .
The head of state of an Ecuadorean part today in Lima , adopted on 6 summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) with the call for greater regional integration was closed for a sustainable progress , equality and security .

Interior ignored illegal arms market
proportion of legal weapons to offences extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning a tightening of Waffengesetzes for private Waffenbesitzer .
That the authorities to respond to the recent events in shootings , injuries and deaths in the golden age of seven of the Moscow has Winogradow Dmitri lawyers .
The police and increase wants to ban the wearing nicht-t ödlicher weapons in the public the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years .
The proposal has supported and the chairman of the promised Duma-Ausschusses for security and the fight against corruption , Irina Jarowaja , that the amendments will be tabled shortly on Arms Act of the Duma .
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities to combat the problems of the screws ' by 'attraction .
The Internet has been an open letter published its author , representatives of various Waffenverbände - call on the authorities to tighten up of 'stupid ' .
The per cent of the crimes of the registered with weapons is very low , the experts in criminal law , the Russian service Wasilij Lesnikow , the BBC .
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012 , while thousands of offences 1,168 as a whole have been recorded for the same period .
The authors of the open letter across are convinced that an intensification of the law on private Waffenbesitzer criminals not hold on to the black market .
For the moment , we can find the authors in Moscow any weapon for little money .
Währenddessen the Ministry of Home Affairs emphasises that the spread of illegal weapons is under control .
suppliers : of the factories to the officers
The arms are several channels on the black market .
There are five main channels such a former colonel , Viktor Baranez told , in the Ministry of ten years and was the General Staff .
Screenshot a website that adopts Waffenbestellungen
The first is to channel the army and the armed forces , which h. weapons during the conflict in the Caucasus has been stolen .
'The ' weapons have been stolen by both the Russian officers and Kaukasiern Baranez itself .
At the second channel illegal weapons , which are stolen Ordnungshütern of criminals .
Baranez explained that these weapons are both from the Waffenkammern directly by the police and the law enforcement agencies have been stolen .
Another arms sold illegally from military Waffenlagern .
In many Militärlagern it was often explosions .
'There is evidence that some cases of arson , in order to cover up the lack of ' weapons , the former soldiers .
Baranez make a contribution to the black market in the arms manufacturers .
'These days , there are countless private Rüstungsfabriken the international competition and therefore to be monopolised by the weapons on the black market , for example , in Moscow , the expert reports .
There is another channel smuggling of the black market .
special about 140g pistols and many weapons come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan .
'in its own , there are sometimes small - scale production and a mafia , the organised ' smuggling , the former soldiers .
How do the weapons come from ?
experts charged , about what the contribution of each of the five channels of the supply of the black market in illegal weapons .
In 2011 , a report was drafted by the Centre for Problemanalysen and public administration .
The experts are considering reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for National Statistics , forensic literature and publicly accessible data on web portals on the subject of arms .
The majority of illegal weapons investigators , comes from the army and the Rechtsschutzbehörden .
The half of all weapons on the black market has to be 'by ' fault of those responsible in their work to do with weapons , it says in the report .
The data of researchers , 17 % of the weapons come from areas of conflict , 14 % to theft in the arms industry and 5 % comes from illegal archaeological excavation team .
An Verkaufsberater a Waffenladens not specifically mentioned , will be assured that for a long time , no one is buying arms , the illegal dig has to be found , because they are out of date .
he says that it is more likely that the supplies , traders in getting a weapons .
Over a Fähnrich a weapon , for example , to buy a pistol TT of the same type .
The weapon and be issued by the fence .
'The trader is the weapon in the city and sells them there for EUR 900 per with two magazines , he told '
'The police , of course , know everything and , therefore , if they do not observe the plan for the detection of crime periodic offer Kontrollkäufe dealers ' illegal weapons , which adds Verkaufsberater there .
'As the Luxusladen '
buyers and sellers find most about acquaintances .
I was looking websites and blogs , as someone who has been on the table , and a person 's attention to a certain place where we could negotiate the price , which would like to wait , I suggested to station 'Begowaja ' ,
I learned The price for the only weapon where

'In order to obtain a weapon , I need a friend , the ' contacts , the Verkaufsberater . 'I have as a friend , but I trust he did not ' .
There are on the markets , but we must go there and agreeing on a code 'of Ivan Iwanowitsch that will be , the daughter has lost a tooth ' .

newcomers to the different ways of looking for weapons .
The former soldiers , Viktor Baranez tried in the middle of the 1990s , the purchaser of illegal weapons , when he wrote an article on this issue .
The scheme , according to him , have not changed .
He was given a Fotoalbum , which was illustrated 'everything ' .
'I felt as the Luxusladen , '' the soldiers .
The buyers Baranez is not according to the pig in a poke , but can try everything .
I buy a potential client does not simply go , but with the seller in the forest , and we ask for a target .
'I can then go there , and when I say that the weapon has a good measure of am convinced that , together , we are negotiating , which describes the expert approach .

During the purchase of illegal firearms is , according to the experts , to count on price of USD 100 to 900 .
According to Mr Kislow of the organisation 'Pravo na oryzhie ' you can buy a gun type Makarow for 100 and 300 dollars .

old battles , new Middle East
The cease - fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be unexpected cornerstone for peace
Will it ever be lasting peace between Jews and Arabs in the Middle East ?
The latest bloody events seem to nip in the bud any such hope .
Amidst the usual blame countless buildings - were killed in ruins , more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis , for the first time and rockets from Gaza are taken in the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem .
However , while the Israelis and the Palestinians in their historic conflict in the Middle East are changing around them .
The Arab spring has created a new situation , uncertain , and whether or not they want it Palestinians and Israelis have been part of this turmoil .
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed .
However , there are reasons to believe that the situation could be at the end of it .
A war will be lost , not yet been won
At first glance , optimism in view of the current situation as anything else would seem to be appropriate .
Even if the on the 21 November week 's battles have strengthened the cease - fire agreed Hartgesottenen continues to both sides .
The leaders of Hamas , the Islamic movement , which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007 , will claim to have fostered by the Israelis , although his group had even large losses .
Although several of the Hamas leader killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in a desolatesten and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet have not succeeded in Israel are packed up to now , to destroy Hamas .
In fact , Hamas in the West Bank , which is a rival , moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah is controlled .
And the Hamas leader could come to the conclusion that they have the time on their side .
However , such as Islamists in the Arab world , of influence have won , Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends can draw on their side .
The Turkey , a regional power wiedererstarkende , in the past , as Israel 's closest ally , Muslim was taken to the Hamas - party like Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States .
Jubelnde Hamas-Anh Gong believe that by Israel , Lebanon in the Islamic north Crescent , is where the militant Hizbollah has the power , Syria , where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren - style Stürzung Bashir Assad , might stand up to Jordan , where Hamas-Verb ündete the King .
And , in particular , the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood , under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - einwohnerstärksten and by far the principal Arab country - from the southern flank of Israel has changed in the balance of the region .
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt , the secular tyrant up to his fall 30 years 2011 , had little time left for Hamas .
In contrast to the brotherhood verschwägert is with the Hamas and its leaders Volksansichten more dependent .
In future , the Hamas diplomatic negotiations could prove to be an actor , even by Israel and the United States could not be squeezed out .
The Israeli hardliners on the other hand , I consider the opposite conclusion .
Hamas is no risk Militärisch seen more .
The Israeli missile defence system , `` Iron Dome 'has been able to prove its worth and many of the rockets have been destroyed .
Zumindest a period of calm and Israel will be able to go to sleep .
The diplomatic firmly believe that the United States remain steadfast in its position . Many European countries have made responsible for the latest Gewalteskalationen Hamas .
Israel is good to have in recent years , especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , who ignored the peace process has , to a large extent .
Although rockets from Gaza killed since 2004 , around 30 Israelis , the country is , have remained relatively free of suicide bombers , not least thanks to the Sperranlagen in the West Bank and in the main part of a possible hineinverlaufen Palestinian State . This the Jewish settlements , which is to protect a breach of international law have been declared , but always be developed further .
Netanyahu . His Likud is a good ally , in the run - up to the elections on 22 January , Avigdor Lieberman , with a still kämpferischeren group .
Why do these hinterlistigen Palestinians to nanny and also leave a State ?
If they do , in fact , the control of the West Bank , they would not have faces as well as their comrades - in - arms in Gaza also missiles ?
No , it is better to keep it short and to punish the wall in check , you should dare to raise your heads .
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to guarantee the Arab spring . However , they could be stopped .
Even if the Islamists , who are sitting now on they will be in place in Egypt and in other countries with difficulties in the country 's own power , have very little left over for Israel ,
The Verteidigungsetat of Israel is greater than with its four Arab neighbours .
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in the restoration of their economy .
The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi zusammentat with Barack Obama , in order to achieve a ceasefire , and perhaps to represent the beginning of a new era , and could be a promising sign -
Even Israelis should think long - term .
Throughout the rest of the Arab world is making democratisation timid steps in the direction of the Palestinians ' right to self - determination - continue to be deprived of their , which is undoubtedly a powder keg , one day in the Israeli - occupied territories will explode , just as this week , there was an explosion in a bus in Tel Aviv .
The repression already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only get worse .
Blutige missions for the eradication of the Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly calling for its diplomatic over the years .
Both sides need a boost from outside
The answer is , those of the more reasonable representatives of both sides , the bulk of the rest of the world and is represented by this newspaper : two states , in which Israel for security purposes are waived areas .
The small , in the near future - hope that the ceasefire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution .
Egypt must stop now working with Turkey and Qatar the supply of arms in the Gaza Strip is better placed than ever before , to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders , supplemented by Gebietstausch and Jerusalem .
Arab nations outside the Hamas and Fatah should move to an agreement .
That more is done for the creation of a Palestinian State , as with the forthcoming proposal on UN-Beobachterstatus .
Even Obama to play its part , to persuade Israel to negotiations .
During his first term he missed the presentation of his own peace plan .
Weit in white House , it seems , it would be equally unwilling to participate in it .
However , this is a deplorable , short - term perspective .
The United States have a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians .

'The large and powerful ' by Moscow : migrants will save money for language
As parliamentarians and civil rights activist , what point about the law on binding language tests for immigrants , criminals are discussing will act with fake certificates
market 13 million migrant workers coming to Moscow and St Petersburg and other cities of Russia .
The majority of them are the citizens of the Central Asia : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
Your sole aim is to make money for the maintenance of the remaining families in the country .
On 1 December , a law came into force , according to which any working immigrant , a test for the knowledge of the Russian language must be certified .
No , this regulation applies only to migrants in the services sector , in the local housing stock and to work in the retail trade .
Jedoch the tests should be according to the time Föderaler Migrationsbehörde compulsory for all migrant workers in the future .
Mr President , we must not only language tests for tests , but also in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation .
language skills must be demonstrated both for the maintenance and extension of the work permit .
exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language .
Ebenfalls of this law will be excluded from the people who receive their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the break - up of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
sense issue and protection of human rights
The whole of the Prüfungsstellen under the aegis of the Puschkin-Instituts for the Russian language , the Russian University of the friendship among peoples , the Moscow State University , the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities .
The migrants can all the tests in cities ; now in Russia more than 160 appropriate centres already been opened .
The initiative on the implementation of the tests was supported by the members of the Duma and the Federal Migrationsbehörde .
civil rights activist , however , before the entry into force of the law on several occasions in the press , the following question : What is all this about ?
What changes does the provision of languages , to deliver both for the Russians and the migrant workers ?
In particular , the spokesman for the Migrationsbehörde say , is concerned , to reduce the number of forced labourers .
`` Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers , the head 'says the representation of the Federal Migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan , Viktor Sebelew .
your rights must be protected , but they had left already .
Just an organised recruitment to 90 % will solve the problems of foreign workers .
The problems of migrants without work , education , language skills and medical assessment .
Sebelew is convinced that a future without necessarily the migrant languages people are putting it under the pretext of aid in the dark , close shack with dozens of assembling , where he and his ilk months without food and documents 12 to 14 hours of the day , will be able to meet , is ill - intentioned
We have achieved many complaints from our migrants .
'In the country , you promised this one , and it has been duped , you will get their passports and not the ' promised , the head of the headquarters for migration , the Tajik Migrationsbehörde Tolib Schwaripow .
Not , head !
however many citizens of the Central Asian republics , in Russia who want to earn money that they control not only the language of the country of destination , but also in their own language , can hardly in writing .
Of course that is not their fault , but rather the evil : Just a few the Turkmen people can afford them and Tajiks a sensible of primary education .
Because there are still in their families do not even have money to feed the children , let alone to buy them , proper clothing , footwear and Schulsachen .
As these children , teenagers to take the first opportunity for making money .
'It is difficult not to be ' languages .
'You humiliated and inferior fühlst thee . '
civil rights activist in terms of the law to stress the following important aspect .
The test only to legal migrants .
Did you not this status , there are no examination and thus no official work .
Währenddessen the vast majority of the migrant workers is also illegal in Russia .
'Herzlich welcome ' or 'entry ban for unauthorised '
Many migrants confirm that in Russia to receive an official status is not easy .
The reasons are bureaucratic obstacles and , of course , the linguistic difficulties .
: legalising costs money : 12 to 16 thousand rouble .
A false registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand .
The staff of the Russian police know that most of our documents and we are not registered , and then to be cases of blackmail .
'you are one or two hundred rouble for cigarettes and tea , expresses the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists .
'Bloß spare no expense on false papers '
Right on the day on which the law was entered into force , that it is not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be falsified .
Some fake certificates to certify the completion of the language tests of staff , the Federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen were already .
The counterfeit documents were printed Farbdrucker with a normal .
Of course the new owners of these were not free of charge : Any migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests , paid seven thousand rouble of the document .
That is more than twice as much as the costs of the official test : This costs three thousand rouble a migrant workers .
I that the most important task is to direct the system there is corruption , so that certificates to protect can not simply be bought , both are officials and human rights activists .
For the moment , the authorities can immigrant workers in the first time by the test , only promise that they will be time for a Sprachgrundkurs .
I also offer newcomers languages are without jobs in areas where no active dialogue with people is necessary .

Following the Court of Appeal confirms the United States a judgement which recognises the restructuring of debt on the group Vitro Handelskonkurs in Mexico has been achieved , not a precedent is created , pernicious for , each national companies with establishments in the neighbouring country , there are payment problems .
We are , then , that the procedures for the survival of companies which allow the Mexican law in the country of the stars and stripes could say contrary to international agreement to be a valid .
In practice , on 15 June , the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale on court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas that the Mexican companies in the confiscation of property , on the other side of the River Congratulations are helpless .
But the biggest Glashersteller decision opens the door in Mexico , because three inconsistencies to refer the matter to the Supreme Court of the United States .
During the judges of the matter is that the main proceedings in Mexico Handelskonkurs dealt with by the Court of Appeal , says the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans , begin by pointing out that the creditor , the bankruptcy rules must be subject to the United States .
The first point , the international cooperation in insolvency proceedings by companies with trans - national profile is not known .
In fact the Modellgesetz to this end the United Nations was created for the harmonisation of international trade law , with the American law has been set up as arbiter institutions .
Secondly the ruling states that the majority required for the restructuring of debt without the votes of the societies to recognise the liabilities in the liquidation of the branches Vitro with its parent company that had not been achieved .
But this possibility is recognised by the Mexican law .
In fact Vitro is not the first case in which this system has been allowed .
There are examples , including half a dozen Agremex Mexicana Comercial and their liabilities in the group of companies by the Istituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles ( Federal Institute for Handelskonkurse ) have been confirmed .
the creditor Richtig is also that , after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches of Vitro , creditors in the courts in the United States against Vitro there , in other words the Geier-Fonds such as Capital Aurelios Aurelios Convergencia , Elliot Internacional Limited and Liverpool , have achieved a majority .
The vote was 45 % would be against 37 % .
This will not be taken into consideration by the Court of Appeal .
Andererseits Vitro there is blame for its difficult situation in 2008 in the framework of the major economic crisis in the United States , which gave the country .
For this reason , the family , González Sada before the same court of appeal , so that the vote in plenary , that is to say , because of the judges were only three of them .
If not , the Cerciorare-Einspruch , will the calls for the review of the procedure by a higher body , in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States .
The most serious aspect of this case is that the Court has set aside a document that the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae ( friend of the Court , which was sent by Vitro procedure within the framework of the law on what is described Handelskonkurse , and what that we stick to the agreements signed by the two countries to the chapter 15 Konkursgesetzes of the United States to comply with , and , had kept
is also important to point out that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on the international trade in other words , the rules laid down in the event of cross - border cases , guarantee equality of debtors and creditors .
Zweibandige Karambole : a blow for Vitro and for the country .

My mexikanisch-amerikanische identity crisis .
Many people were forced to leave because of the lack of opportunities , Mexico
Mexicans have a tendency to blame the immigrants , they call them difficult times , he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent visit to Mexico City I had only just cuts through the hall and the passport was reached , a dilemma in me .
signs referred to two queues : 'A 'for ' Mexicanos Mexicans `` ) , the other for 'Extranjeros ' ( ' aliens '' ) .
I was there , a few seconds , to which I should like to go .
I grew up in Zentralkalifornien and all my life was called 'the Mexicans . ''
An ethnic acronym - just as my friends in Boston 'or ' Irish my friends in New York 'Italian ' .
I decided Später Mexikanisch-Amerikanisch 'for ' .
But that Mexico has been here .
And in the country of my grandfather , there was no need for Kürzeln or Bindestrichen .
I was simply Americans .
I am at least in Spanish , good enough for me to say in this language two ends in an interview .
But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers my American emphasis , and I will not go well .
So , I took my American passport and undertook in the queue for Extranjeros .
I thought at the moment , this week , as the future President of Mexico Nieto Pena Enrique went to the White House in order to meet with President Obama .
On the agenda all those issues which were expected to take if the heads of these two countries : immigration , drugs and trade .
Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy , you are talking about is a reason for this is that today , with a high probability of Mexicans , in Mexico , rather than emigrating to the United States .
He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading block for example of the European Union .
And Pena Nieto swore to Mexico , the war against the drug cartels , even if he has any details in this respect .
Mexico 's relationship with the United States is complicated and full Ressentiment .
The Americans are most probably never been a single idea that the United States in 1848 invaded in Mexico and have forced the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun to leave them to more than half of their territory .
But for the Mexicans in centuries in minutes , and not to have to think back to this event .
As soon as a US-Regierungsbeamter is therefore only one hears mildeste criticism of Mexico , in the Mexican press and the elites of the country , complaints , as the Americans are bringing pressure to bear on the sovereignty of their neighbour .
And the children themselves Montezumas on the war - path .
And yet the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans in the United States .
desire to talk about sentiments ?
There are more than enough .
Mexico has winners and losers , people , for the country , and offers opportunities for the other , it does not .
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles , Las Vegas example , in Denver , or San Antonio live , is that of a point in our family tree , a person may be a parent or Großelternteil was necessary , and no chance in Mexico towards auswanderte north .
And , in the majority of cases , this person was a profile - brown - skinned , uneducated , from a poor village , etc .
We are the offspring of these people , and our allegiance to them .
Not Mexico .
And although we now live , perhaps , the American dream , that it does not have good jobs , the Mexican . American the dream which have visited and good schools we live , we must never lose sight of the fact , is .
Our identity is perhaps sometimes blurred , but what our loyalty is concerned , this is not the case .
This is certainly the United States .
I also we are aware that not many Members may the Mexican ruling class .
This is based on reciprocity .
you see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look down on us , because we are not sufficiently mexikanisch .
Our Spanish will never be good enough , our links with Mexico not strong enough .
your opinion , our existence is a symbol of the failure .
If not , our families in Mexico , they would not have had failed .
And then we would see us now caught behind the Seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States , but somehow lost .
My wife , who was born in Guadalajara and as a child einwanderte legally in the United States , I am reminded that , between Mexicans and Mexican Americans are tension because Mexicans have a clearer picture of what they are , and who Mexican Americans , they take .
While they American citizen , it is , as part of the two countries .
However , many Mexican Americans , who I know have the feeling that neither the one nor the other country .
We love the Mexican bond lot Tigres del Norte region , but also Bruce Springsteen .
We have the best of both worlds , but it is not rooted in .
In Mexico we be seen as the Americans .
And in the United States we be seen as Mexicans .
As I should learn during my trip , there is something more complicated this relationship : Some Mexican leaders Bildungsbürgertums wish to include and parts of their links to the diaspora .
you want to use as a provisional Mexican Americans ' ambassador 'for Mexico , which represent their interests in the United States .
We should tell our American colleagues , and put pressure on as great a visit to the country 's political leadership to intensify its relations with Mexico .
Now .
That will not happen .
Unfortunately , feelings of many injured .
And in view of the unfair distribution of incomes , the extensive corruption and Drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country .
I fear that these Amigos , it alone .
That is fair .
If at least some of the Mexicans are not yet ready to the United States for dealing with Mexico , a century and a half ago , a resentment , to grant it must also accept , that some of the Mexican Americans with their family members , as it was not so long ago .
Hmmm .
Perhaps we are 'Mexicans , as I thought ' .

Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
As Mr Pena Nieto Mexico next President , at the start of his term of office and analysed by the BBC Grant the challenges ahead of it leaving everything and mixed feelings of its people .
Aktuell transport is particularly bad in Mexico City .
Even for better days ago , this is always a clogged city , but on Monday was created as a ring of steel , the absperrt and several important routes in the capital is causing havoc on the roads .
The aim , however , it was not to disrupt commuters are on their way to work , but to stop demonstrators , to achieve this Parliament .
On Saturday Präsidentenbinde of Mexico and the new President will receive Enrique Pena Nieto take over the leadership of the nation .
He faces a complex task .
Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderons Mexico is economically has to prove its worth , but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs , in the last six years , has already led to 60 000 lives .
'My government is strongly committed to the violence , to reduce Pena Nieto stated earlier this week in the Oval Office the US President Barack Obama .
I intend to propose a new security strategy , with which we can achieve this objective .
Before it on an equal footing with the US President , was Pena Nieto Mexico as Governor of his\/her own Member State .
In this densely populated , rambling part of the country 's capital city , opinions are divided on the new head of state .
A direct man
In the remote village Bravo del Valle , for example , like to remind you of it .
inhabitants of Urlaubsorts to write to him the development of tourism and the building of the infrastructure .
In order to achieve the city , you can run on a motorway building Nieto Pena and which would be a great improvement on the fragile , holprigen roads , it was again .
badges with its name are outside of a modern Sportzentrums and an impressive interactive museum on climate change .
'We expect him ' real and lasting change his friend and political ally , as Mr Gabriel Olvera Kongressabgeordneter for the party Pena Nietos the Institutional Revolutionary Party , is working .
Especially , as regards the safety and economy , we hope for an interesting and real change , there is an urgent need in our country .
After years of power 81 of the Institutional Revolutionary Party has been replaced by Vicente Fox in the year 2000 .
The Olvera - is that the party after 12 years of Los Pinos Präsidentenpalasts outside the great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto .
The accusations of the opposition , the new president lacks substance , it rejected .
He is a very direct man , very committed and have great plans for the country .
He was a great statesman , above all , it was also someone who can hear .
But , on the other side of the Heads of State , many people do not share this view of their former governor .
In Nezahualcoyotl , also known as Ciudad Neza , the contrast could be paved roads of the brilliant del Valle not growing .
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of itself .
And the problems in the municipality of urban nature are crucial .
Earlier this year , the military was involved in the neighbourhoods in order to combat drug gangs operating , and violence against women is a particularly acute problem .
At a wasteland spots in the vicinity of a large landfill in the last two years alone , the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind .
During the period of the State Governor Pena Nieto - Mexico over 1 , 000 women were murdered a statistic , which exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez for their violence and the killing of innocent women is well known .
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that it is not appropriate to address the problem of the murders of women during his term of office .
However , in the worst case , its government have closed their eyes to the problem .
In a Betonbau , typical of the run - down quarter Irinea Buendia is struggling with tears , as it shows me photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna .
The official version of events Mariana , 2010 , has committed suicide .
However , their family believes that it was murdered by their partners .
'When I arrived in their home , it seemed as if their bodies have been washed `` Senora Buendia .
There were signs that it was beaten and Leichenstarre , which had already begun .
During her mother , their history of the wall , has told us a picture of Mariana to us . It is appropriate , in addition to a cross , which bears a single word : justice .
However , it is precisely this , the family , we have until now prevented from it .
The authorities have with me when I was a Schwätzerin , Unruhestifterin Nörglerin that .
you want is to accept their verdict simple and shuts up .
'But that is not possible , if there were so many flaws and shortcomings , it says .
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday he receives Präsidentenbinde which will also have a great responsibility .
Mexican tens of thousands of families have been learned in the last six years of violent crime , and the new President has promised during his term of office , particularly to this problem .
'I hope , as President , it is true , as he was governor , which says ' PRI-Kongressabgeordnete Olvera in Valle 's del well done .
However , that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most .

is now cause of an AIDS deaths due to late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old , when he was : the inquiry was HIV positive .
'It was as if a bomb stores ' he says about the moment , in which he received the diagnosis , the doctor without apparent attempts to 'success ' .
He hidden it prior to his family .
He decided to have only started his illness and to be informed , and that with such commitment that he has just celebrated its 43rd birthday .
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest of the hospital patients HIV-Einheit Civil de Guadalajara ( HCG ) , in which it was after many battles in 1994 .
Fabrizio lives with the humane Immundefizienz-Virus ( HIV ) , 22 years , since the beginning of the 1990s was difficult to imagine when there were many doubts , few treatment and stigma .
Damals it has itself to adopt the director of a clinic IMSS , the 'because in a dead end .
Damals AIDS synonym for death .
Today , it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life .
But many people are still in hospital , and that none of their disease in which the virus has already caused by their immune system and is exhausted , and are the victims of opportunistic infections .
31 years after the arrival of the AIDS in the world , that is to say the date of the first reported cases of 'the great success today means , the head of the declared HIV-Einheit HCG , Jaime Villanueva Andrade , in which he said that the information that the survival of a patient who starts on time the treatment , and the survival of the general population are exactly the same in April of this year , a reputable scientific publication has been based .
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV\/AIDS , Andrade Villanueva by the scientists , that since 2008 schlussfolgerten that AIDS is not a death sentence , but that the years of survival and the quality of life of the degree of prejudice to the immune system depended the people at the start of the treatment , and that would have a greater chance of those which are not end up to 30 years in a sort of 200 CD4 and 50 years , in a sort of 500 CD4 : .
Einfach said that the above , mean that , in the age of 25 who receives the diagnosis HIV positive here can easily be 75 years of age , as long as it is under control , this expert said .
In order to be able to operate properly , this progress must be reminded of the fact that , on average , the life expectancy of the Mexicans today six years .
) has reduced the number of people dying of AIDS cases of 6.678 4.862 in 2007 to the year 2011 ( annual ONUSIDA ) , it is nevertheless true that since the appearance of the AIDS that 60 % of the national database patients Even if the mortality rate recorded in recent years has significantly reduce ( have died in Mexico .
The mere Jalisco in the year 2011 255 people died , and until the month of May this year there are , however , already assured 187 deaths , since 2005 , there is universal access to antiretroviral medicines .
- Why is , people still die ?
In my opinion , the problem is not the access to treatment .
This is my opinion , and it is in our hospital .
at least in the last 12 years , we have had no problems in the medicines . The problem is that the people in an advanced status far , because they do not know its Infektionszustand very late stage , in other words the disease .
He makes a resounding message : ' Nine really do represent 10 patients come to us if they already have a sense of infection . In order to be able to influence the global mortality , earlier diagnoses are needed , which is why all the people , where this is necessary , must be offered a screening tests ' .
This proposal to vote in favour of the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco ( Coesida ) ( Committee on the State of Jalisco AIDS-Vermeidung ) and patients as Fabrizio , the test was carried out in a private laboratories , for the sole reason that it is a friend of the young age , despite its AIDS-Phase was already and even had the tumour krebsartigen Kaposi-Sarkom ( a ) , which is the usual complications .
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS .
Some think that they will die , and do not want to hear .
'If I have to die , three times , it says ' burst in my case .
The amendment was to improve , as I am , that drives ernähre good sport and take note of the medicines .
Today only his parents know that he had cancer .
I live a normal life , as everyone else .
'I am working for , a past , have an active and responsible Sexleben , I respect to my health and the other person ' , Fabrizio to the agreed , to share with its intimate details JALISCO MILENIO with his testimony to those who are today in the context of global AIDS-Tages afraid to encourage .
You should make the test , if they are used for risk they know whether you are HIV positive , and the sooner the better , and if they already know the diagnosis , they should learn how , as everyone can live in a responsible manner .
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012 .
condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and large holes in the street , Ricardo Salazar said , a journalist from Guadalajara , which is the cause of HIV has adopted .
And the prevention is the most important thing .
An the certain places ' the distribution of condoms actually been increased ; previously they individually , but now they have been made to provide us with a hundred of packages , which is good , but there are still people who have no access to a condom ' , he said .
Regarding the Risikopersonen for new infections among young people .
'What do you need the ' is a widespread Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal , social workers , employees in pharmacies in schools and in the health service , the young people do not want to expose the correspondent assured .
He proposed , before these inefficient ; the new distribution of condoms are not just behind the counter , but in Ausgabegeräten in public toilets of institutions , which are often visited by young people .
It should not be promoted the promiscuity .
It should not be paid for the beer and Motel , as the governor Emilio González , in response to the question of whether , under his administration condoms would be distributed .
'sexuality from is ; it is not the best , the closer to the exercise of condoms , which is already a sexual activity , he expressed it to the point .

In the United States , and of them went on strike Supermarkt-Besch äftigte
Any fourth US young people at the sitting behind by Donald 's McCarthy
In the last few days in the US there has been massive protests against low wages in shops and restaurants of Wal - Mart popular Fast-Food-Ketten as McCarthy , Donald 's burger King , Taco Bell , Wendy 's and Kentucky Fried Chicken .
As no one can predict whether the protests by swelling further or whether they will soon be back to the air .
The protests are supported by trade unions and many left - wing non - profit - making organisations .
Aside from the increase in the modest wages of simple Wal - Mart Fast-Food-Besch and the organisers of officials are following the protests of the aim to set up trade unions .
No one is hardly organised this sector of the economy .
46 cents in the year ?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving , on the so - called black Friday , which took place in the United States , the sales anlockten millions of customers , which sometimes too Handgemengen .
This day some Walmart-Mitarbeiter laid down in the world , of which there are , 2.2 million of their work and , together with trade unions and left - wing activists bestreikten branches of the chain which is targeted at people are low and middle - income .
Wal - Mart , all the products sold , of children 's nappies and on Jagdgewehre Autobatterien to Staubsaugern , eggs and milk .
The products in the average Walmart-Filialen is between 8 and 27 % cheaper than in large supermarkets .
As such , the many buy a slightly Walmart-Besch paid officials only on our own work .
The prices and Wal - Mart Warensortiment made one of the largest companies in the United States .
critics Wal - Mart that can sell the goods are often only right , because the people are badly paid .
latter also complain about serious conditions , forklift zum Beispiel lack of or Handscanner .
The participants of the protests of the 'black Friday called ' wage increases , and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the insurance betriebseigene from 30 % to 100 dollars per month .
A typical Walmart-Mitarbeiter 9.5 US - dollar , which deserves the moment , this increase is not doing , they have said .
researchers from the Californian university in Berkeley show that , if the company - hour average pay the increased to 12 Dollars the Wal - Mart , would cost of 3.2 billion dollars .
These are ca . 1.1 % more than they are now fighting for employment .
dignity Wal - Mart fully pass on the increases in salary at any cost , the customers buy only 46 cents more in the future .
Pro year compared with today , for it would be an increase in expenditure of only 12,39 dollar .
supporter of Wal - Mart , please note that only in nine federal states to protests , and this has caused the businesses of any losses .
The black Friday was not in his shop from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday , and the next day , in that period , Article sold Wal - Mart , approximately 5 000 per second .
Overall Walmart-Kassen the 'black Friday ' almost 100 million from had transactions .
The spokesman of the company , Dan Fogelman , stated in an interview on the website of the left - wing Huffington postal services , that a total of 'less than five ' Walmart-Mitarbeiter niederlegten and the work of the action of a merely 'stunt ' of the trade unions , the protests have been organised .
Farming 'free ' .
The protests were to continue this week in New York , where the aim , however , were not Walmart-Filialen ( in the progressive city so far non - existent are therefore not desirable , but McDonald 's and other low - cost restaurants .
McDonald 's says that the companies sell billion chickens , and yet no Krankentage to you , and you will not pay for your honest work .
Jumaane Williams , who is a member of the New York City Council
At the moment , the minimum wage in accordance with a federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollar is the hour .
In Fast-Food-Restaurants will gradually increase the minimum wage , but not too much on average , and their ordinary people in New York of USD 8,90 the hour .
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city .
How is it possible , in New York , with so little money is beyond me .
There was even a time when almost a quarter of all American young people in school at McDonald 's behind the Theke , however , the young people were living in their parents .
Only a was seen as the main source of income or planned to revive , continue to remain there .
Well I meet in interviews with staff at McDonald 's constantly people complain that it with this wage and sometimes even manage to feed their children .
Andererseits are there in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal a comment , the rapporteur points out , it is irresponsible to have children , if we did not know how to feed them .
The participants of the protests , on Thursday at 6.00 a.m. in the morning before the McDonald 's in the 40th Street and Avenue Madison , demanded that the bank teller and cooks of Fast-Food-Restaurants receive a minimum wage of USD 15 the moment which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage is in line with that .
you called for the education of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche .
The US law prohibits the governance , this objective to stand in the way of trade or to issue early warnings to and made redundant .
Andererseits the management , it is not easy .
The foundation of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche is also difficult for objective reasons .
The main reason is the high staff turnover .
are unhappy
Lautstarke protests it was on this day , many other Fast-Food-Restaurants in Manhattan .
The culmination of the protests was an Assembly at midday , McDonald 's Times Square on , which were some local democrats , including Stadtratsmitglied Jumaane Williams , who said , ' McDonald 's , billion chickens sell , and yet no Krankentage to you , and you will not pay for your honest work . '
The demonstrators have been supported by other prominent New York Democrats , for example , Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill De Blasio , who said that 'we support the Fast-Food-Mitarbeiter together so that they receive and achieve a fair wage should be the economic prosperity that everyone deserves New York .
According to the New York Times this was the main action of its kind in the history of the US Fast-Food-Industrie .
Jedoch only a few hundred people were on the ground , which is far from all in the Fast-Food-Branche are employed in New York in the tens of thousands of work .
As we do not yet know whether the flame of these protests mobilise a whole .

Singapore needs to save the economy .
The Singapurer the blame for the fact that they have no children on the career , the stress and the costs of property and the bringing up children .
'The population has to grow from Singapore ' .
I am a patriotischer husband , being patriotic my wife , we are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life !
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising for Minzbonbons , but nevertheless , or precisely because of this , they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore viralen a video on YouTube .
The rates are part of a Rapper-Songs , the local slogans such as ' Schieben a ' bao `` ( loaf ) in the foot , about the low birth rate in Singapore to make .
The advertising agency BBH has done , the video that preserves the hope that the advert on entertaining way to achieve the problem .
your creative head Alexander Hamilton says that he use the power of the music for people to fulfil their 'national duty to ' .
This is something that only on the Internet we therefore had to be - and make fun .
It is the biggest problem in the country .
The Fortpflanzen we are the worst in the world , so we remarked that this is an issue to which we had to deal with .
We knew that the government is attempting , for example , how much the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of Speed-Dating-Abenden ( rapid Flirts ) .
You were Möglich creative that many of these ideas , but not necessarily to success .
Therefore we thought : why do we not make a creative way as possible , in order to tackle this problem , such as , for example , to a rap komponieren ?
1.2 children
Who is not easy to this issue , the government is of Singapore .
Every year , they are from USD 1 300 for political action to encourage the citizens to have more children .
A package of the government for married couples to parents and up to 15 000 dollars per child , extended maternity leave and distributed fiscal advantages .
But everything has so far had little success .
Singapore is a rich , hochtechnologischer city state in south - east Asia , also for the conservatism of its leaders and the strict social controls is well known .
According to its national Bevölkerungsbehörde the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
The last time this rate of 2 - which , as is well known - Ersetzungsrate was in 1976 .
So , why the Singapurer not have more children ?
Tan Wei Ming , Executive Director for marriage and family policy of national Bevölkerungsbehörde , says that this is the result of a `` better training and career is more ' .
'This has enabled the people , to marry and to establish a family to put much more options with regard to life goals and priorities ' , they said .
These changes in the social conditions for the higher number of single parents and the delay in the marriage have contributed and births , the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore .
Währenddessen an immigration policy , which has led to a drastic rise in Zuwanderungen aims to the reduction of the population to feelings of resentment in the local population .
In Singapore websites , where there is a covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing , particularly against the Chinese , who criticised that it will maintain low wages and not integrate .
The increase in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons for the ruling party in Singapore its worst possible outcome reached last year since independence .
Since the elections , an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers .
unexpected consequences
Whilst the falling birth rate , the well - known impact on the growth of a nation , the tax revenues that the health costs and the immigration policy , this example shows , Singapore , unexpected consequences .
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes to be built .
However , it also has an impact on the housing market .
The authority for urban development has started to monitor the number of small Appartements as ' and 'Schuhschachteln are known in certain areas of the city must be built .
This Appartements have a Wohnfläche of 46 square metres and show a large Verkaufserfolg .
But there is the concern that they promote the way of life of the people living alone and that it will discourage to build the construction of housing , for large families .
But Lim Yew Soon , the Director - General of Immobilienfirma EL Developers , says , to sell his ' Schuhschachteln 'much more quickly than larger houses .
You are so popular , and units are compromising the days and weeks to even more quickly than the larger houses .
This means that for our Cash Flow very much better .
He is , however , that to be the developers new clearer standards which previously put obstacles in the way when they are too many small houses were in a project that has been made .
Regarding a lot of stress
Singapore is a city state .
Even if these new rules are preparing the way for an increase in the birth rate is clear from the talks with the Singapurern Finanzviertel in the work that they have no real impact could be .
'The people are strong gestresst , the housing and education are expensive , and many a young managers will be delayed .
The children can get other .
'For me it is important to have my own money and time to have another says ' approximately 20 - year - old man .
men and women in their careers , the stress and the cost of their ownership and education as the reasons why they do not have children .
And the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to children , as the government can do so much .

Héctor 'Hetin Reyes `` : `` basketball was my life '
The Weltenbummler Basketballs of Héctor Hetin , '' `` the Korbsport Reyes , has been more than 60 years and has visited the whole world .
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of the country as ' Basketballs Héctor Hetin Reyes ' .
Before he , in 2008 , by a stroke of the wheelchair Rexes , 6 years was part of that sport , it should be a player and lower classes , players in the first national League and head of the agent BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or Basketballverbands President .
'My life I have drafted in basketball me many , indeed , several hats at the same time , when I was the chief BSN President , the President of the Union and national team in the 1990s are reminded Reyes , during a visit by Primera Hora at home with him in Bayamón , Isabel , its loyal wife , for more than 50 years of residence .
'basketball was my life . '
Reyes not exaggerating with this statement .
The walls of this House long career , they are almost all dekoriert with photographs and memories of his and bear witness to it .
Bayamón heart
The emotionalsten memories are those that in his time Vaqueros in the middle of the 1950s , the players to 1982 , where it will be celebrated as Mitgeschäftsführer or 15 - year - old anniversary of the club managers .
These were 'my best years that I have enjoyed the most , because I would be part of the eight championships Vaqueros since 1967 , it was as Mitgeschäftsführer or coach .
It was met many years , including five championships in 1975 , one by one , the 1971 .
And then I have adopted with a championship in 1981 , the year of Debüts of Jerome Mincy BSN in .
From then took over 'Cuco Ortiz ' , which was a very good managers ' Reyes says .
I know that at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) was given to me Bartow genes , worked as a trainer and said : `` I have a very strong and 2 m big players .
Möchtest you it ? '
And this was the beginning of Mincy , one of the best players , Puerto Rico had ever .
Bartow subsequently the recommended Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse , which was one of our best and could creep Werfer .
I know , as he said that , if a championship Mincy allows for Bayamon Gausse had to be a further .
The Vaqueros Gausse with the championship , but he was already out of a gap in 1988 , because it already has been at the top of the Union .
At that time , he drew it to enjoy its application and the Mincy in the national football team .
I remember when we first time on the vorolympischen Turnier in Mexico , against the United States .
bronze should be , if not actually Canadian the referee the recent Spielzug after the World Cup was in 1990 , in which we said Reyes , whereas the fourth place repeat what has , for the second time ,
War this group of the World Cup in 1990 , the best national team you have ever seen ?
you is one of the best , as well as those who work in the 2004 Olympic Games to the dream team won .
My favourite but the team of the 1991 panamerikanischen Games in Cuba , where we won and gold the team of the United States has offered a fight , as when they won in the World Cup bronze .
With regard to the crew were not only Mincy Gausse , Ramon Rivas , Robert Fico López and 'Piculín Ortiz ( once again ) , but also the young players ( Javier ) ' , ' Toñito Colón and James Carter , the brothers León ( Francisco and Edgar ) and Mario 'Quixote ' Morales , the 1990 , for a Knieverletzung not able to be here .
A team , which in terms of figures , perhaps not the best , but with the gold medal won and which are a cause of great joy of those was vorolympischen Turniers Neuquén in 1995 , Argentina .
With such as ' Canito Nieves ' players , Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the players are closed because of the events in the Mar del Plata Panamerikanischen Games , we won contrary to all the gold medal forecast .
Who was the best players of Puerto Rico ?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz .
His figures at the level of international tournament are impressive .
Nobody in Puerto Rico at this level that has dominated Piculín as such .
And this , without taking account of his career in the various bodies , in which he has played .
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico ?
This is a difficult issue .
We had a number of good and coach , Julio Toro Flor Meléndez , Carlos Morales , Raymond Dalmau , Armandito Torres .
Of the boy I like the work of Leo Arill well .
Do I is the best in the Association of what you have achieved ?
I was part of the most successful era of national team from 1988 to 1995 BSN the beginning of the 1990s was up to 17 teams in a season .
What you are doing is ?
There are things that I could have been introduced , such as the regionalisation of the lower categories .
The fact that the boys Ponce in , for example , only play in their territory , and only in the national Playoffs on crews from other parts of the island .
Today many children make unnecessary travel and Games .
I see at least the result of the prescribed and training courses for coach , and referee Tisch-Offizielle .
I am proud of my .
What you are going to do now ?
I am happy to listen to music , videos of music my time on YouTube and enjoy my grandchildren and I can go to a Basketballspiel .
And of course , I have been enjoying my wife , Isabel society , which was always on my side .

start of course , of the 'at the end of the world '
Every week , the students to study apocalyptic issues , such as the nuclear war zombies , virus and seeds and global warming .
Every Semester , if the Religionsprofessor decided on a course to the end of the world he knew that he has an irresistible the hook , by the end of the 'long Rückwärtszählung ' of the Maya-Kalenders on 21 December , which many people thought that it was the end of the world .
But Charmé had no idea of what to expect in the next two months , the devastating hurricane Sandy , which some people have described as a ' Deudarmaggedon ' , as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel , the place where the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse .
'I have not noticed that this said apokalyptischste the Semester that has ever occurred ' Charmé , this week will be the university students Rutgers-Camden ( New Jersey ) .
When someone today , as if we were thirty days away from what the world would , of course , this is a really good time .
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality .
And it is not the only Professor , offering the courses of this semester which should really be the last in the history of the 'end of the world ' .
In the case of Professor Temple beisitzende Vacker , Barry is the path 'Media , culture and the end of the world ' .

'We , therefore , analyse these ideas spread with the time , he said , and the way that hypothetical scenarios be offered to a specific human behaviour .

This month we are considering the students films with apokalyptischem content and examined , as compared with the real life left .
'I have tried to inform the students ' possible of what is probably impossible to be credible and Vacker said .

The apocalyptic sects or Religionsmentalität is really only a question of comfort or the lack of it .
The 25 - year - old student Wekesa In order for psychological and medical care , said to have seen all the apocalyptic films .
'Never have I heard of a teaching , where it will be informed of it .
I am perfectly happy to do it .
But none of these students - and even less a professor said , to think , to the last date of 21 December 2008 .
'Our initial project - the subject of the Maya , and to certain way , we deny it , Julie Zeglen said , last year in student Temple , 21 years old and from West Chester .
The Maya never said before the end of the world ; it is only a key point in the calendar Restall said .
He , however , to see that in the western society an apocalyptic fears that a number of amendments , as the people around them with the forecast of going back centuries of the end of the world responded to .
The Internet has increased this speculation .
'Anderenorts the people do not think so , he says .
This is particularly the case in the English - speaking world .
Joseph Dougherty Religionsprofessor , the University of La Salle , this year , the Philippines to respond quickly to the question of whether it is in a position to know about the 'end of the world ' .
'The Philippines are not at the end of the world ' , he wrote as a suggestion to a derogation a higher authority .
We have a pardon by the Pope .
Restall pointed out that , over the years , many days by the recent Court was speaking , and said that , if nothing is happening on 21 December , or immediately think of the people to a new date that the 21 December philosophierten the beginning of a seven - year period , that would be the end of the world .

The film Argo : If 's worst is to Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob Islamist occupied demonstrating students the US Embassy in Tehran , 52 and diplomats as hostages .
For them to be released , they called for the extradition of the ousted , Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi after the revolution in the United States , which have for decades have fled preserving the Patronat on his regime .
The American Government , there were no positive way out of this situation , they could not afford to take on board the Shah , because that confidence massively damaging their allies in other countries .
at it was not in the situation in Iran , where the revolution in the setting up of a theocratic regime has led to obtain the release of the hostages .
It was a serious blow for the reputation of the United States , and the subsequent fiasco all the violent attempt to retrieve even worse .
The inevitably caught diplomats have been freed , finally , 444 days after negotiations with the Algerian government had been given .
The fate of the hostages show called home to a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer sentiments .
The debacle in Iran has helped significantly to defeat for Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980 .
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of the history of the United States , which , indeed , a small partial victory .
Unmittelbar before the occupation of the message were six Botschaftsmitarbeitern the flight .
This ended after many complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador .
The CIA it , in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran ; we helped them a extravagante story Verdeckung to its true identity , they were travelling with Canadian passports as members of a disguised Filmstabes , the supposedly Drehorte visited the country a Science-Fiction-Film .
combination of Genres
The experts ' by 'Exfiltration , Mr Méndez , developed plan also made the necessary cooperation Hollywoods .
That was the cover Article appeared to be credible on this film , in professional journals it press conferences were held and the fictitious Produktionsgesellschaft had a real office .
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time . The film is based on the memory of Mr Mendez .
Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres .
On the one hand , it is a realistic Politthriller , but at the same time a so - called `` Caper Movie ' , in other words the history of a successful Husarenstücks such as for example the film Ocean 's Eleven .
As in the film Stimmungsebenen - which , on the one hand , from Tehran Dokumentarszenen ikonische Titelsequenz ( in the contemporary photographs shown , and also in the Filmfassung the same situation , there are no major differences ) .
On the other hand , the loose passages from Hollywood , the ironic and therefore easy to exaggerate .
And then there are the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions - the men in suits Besprechungstisch Amtsfluren on the phone , ...
Ben Affleck with this film has been a remarkable start of his career .
From a respectable belächelten actors is a director , and also as an actor it is no longer the objective ironischer comments .
Argo be films third is no easy thrillers ( Gone Gone baby , 2007 ) and the thriller ( 2010 ) city without mercy .
it at first , the film Afflecks is not killed in Boston of the director .
The sense of the atmosphere was the place to the characteristics , which the previous films abhoben this film director Hollywoods the standard .
Affleck this sense , however , is also in the Argo , where Tehran played by Canada ' .
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have taken place , the really Eingangssequenz the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity , however , and the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability , that is the case , when they move , the story .
A similar effect Affleck achieved with his team in fictional scenes ( the wrong Filmstab in Tehran on a bazaar .
The act of far too many places
The director had to address it not , in fact , that the history of many in the cinema sense , exciting scenes .
With the little it is working very well , but the reality - sometimes nachhilft something which is not always so elegantly ( the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone call , in America or the chase on the runway , are somewhat curious ) .
The weakness of the Argo is too broad spread of the need , too much to act in too many places to have to show .
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in their roles as very charmingly Hollywood-Mitarbeiter , but their characters deserves more space , and they are in the film certainly not alone .
Afflecks film by pulling to lose something . It is a film , which we are pursuing with some interest and goutieren shaping and to a thriller erinnernden Retro-Stil from the 70 years .
enthusiasm he is , however , difficult .
The memory of a certain way of living up to now of history and as proof of this , such as excessive but the ideas of the all - powerful and allwissenden secret services , but it is enough .

Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung : the test should be made or not ?
The PSA-Test to reject , in fact , sometimes incorrect results with false or negative , but also false positive results , which lead to unnecessary medical intervention .
This leads to greater hesitation , the cowardly men for conducting Früherkennungstests .
Should the test , or not ?
We have obtained two consultant 's opinion .
The studies conducted in the United States were many disruptors between Kontrollgruppen so that to interpret the data and to give unambiguous recommendations is difficult .
Another study , this time from Europe , came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early detection .
This study has also shown that , when , after 12 years of Nachbeobachtung the likelihood of the education of Metastasen 30 and 40 % higher , if no screening was conducted .
As such , I commend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years ago , when one has a direct relatives of the already been to prostate cancer .
When men afro-amerikanischer origin also a higher risk .
The most important thing is to take the right decision was recognised as a form of cancer .
There are other types of cancer and the aggressive the indolent .
According to the patients , the extent of the risk of cancer really made clear by the possible options left unaddressed Prostatakrebse which can , if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term , and in these cases for a more active monitoring of the disease is it to be highlighted .
Today many men , in which it has no treatment of cancer , rather than , as it is not and aggressive cancer is not a threat to their lives .
It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them to progress in the treatment of the disease .
You certainly with greater accuracy of the criteria for deciding who should be treated , and who does not .
As such , I would recommend to the implementation of the tests .
The most important , but it is to speak with his GP , in order to determine whether or not he should be carried out .
In cooperation with the international society for Urologie Movember has developed a device , with which it is possible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of PSA-Tests .
This document ( currently only in English , but a translation will be available very shortly ) can be downloaded http : //ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening addressed under the following :
prevention of the disease
Unfortunately , there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer .
Despite the progress made in the field of research , the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of disease .
It is estimated that 30 % of cancers prevented if all good enough to eat and would be able to move around .
'If there were no more smokers , this figure will rise by at least 50 % , André Beaulieu emphasised , the spokesman for the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft .
But is estimated that approximately 10 % of cancers are caused by it .
Several remain unresolved .
For the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority , despite the reduction in the number of smokers .
Smoking of cases is responsible for 85 % of lung cancer .
There is also a risk factor in several other types of cancer .
It damages the health of the people .
'Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million , the spokesperson for smokers ' regrets André Beaulieu .
Ermutigende reduce the risk of data , 10 years after the rejection of the cigarettes , to die of cancer .
The weight
According to the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease .
you seem to increase the risk of breast cancer , Grimmdarm - Mastdarm - Speiseröhren - Bauchspeicheldrüsen and cervical cancer .
'The research shows that there is a regular physical activity during the whole life of protecting against Grimmdarmkrebs '
The food
The Organisation recommends also to restrict the consumption of red meat .
In on a large scale , it increases the risk of a Grimm - or of the disease .
cooked meats should also be avoided .
The preservation of meat by please or long process that could lead to the formation of carcinogens .
'and the body which can harm the development of cancer ' , he said .
vitamins
In recent years several scientists have studied the connection between vitamin supplements - and cancer .
your investigations are at present no conclusive .
The Canadian Krebsgesellschaft vitamin E to the studies are contradictory .
During a study to reduce the risk of cancer , like others , has more of an increase .
The effect of Vitamin D on cancer has also still not made quite clear .
I also emphasised that it is Mr Beaulieu as important , with his GP of its concerns and his family - to speak .
'The implementation of a Früherkennungstest not lead to cancer .

For 180 Aidswaisen Esitjeni in the village of the club has received wisdom Voices for Africa in Germany .
70 of them are attending secondary school .
For 15 or 20 euros per month , we can take a sponsor .
you guarantee child , and the fees uniforms a warm meals Gogo-Center every day of the week .
Imbongi means or Zulu Geschichtenerzähler Lobpreiser .
The Bantusprache a fluent in this area , but no one can talk of experience .
For almost ten years , the chorus of songs a foreign language , and in this way , and to bring them back to where they originally come from : in the southern Africa .
Because the crow flies 733 8 kilometres of Heidelberg , Swaziland , in the north - west of the UK , there are the village Esitjeni by the Stimmgewalt of the German Chores depends .
Vierzig % are infected
Approximately 2000 people there , some still in simple Lehm Strohhütten - and a large number of whom are children .
More than 300 of them have no parents more , because these are HIV .
In Esitjeni a small foretaste of what is quite Swaziland : high HIV-Infektionsrate , according to UNICEF lowest life expectancy in the world .
restrictions of male Vorhaut , to minimise the risks of contamination exponentially half , it will not be accepted by the population .
More than 40 % of the people in Swaziland - virus of the deficiencies in the middle , with thirty is not uncommon to die .
In a joint Afrika-Reise in the spring of 2005 the chorus discovered in the village , but above all the Imbongis saw many children in the streets , which not only a lack of parental responsibility , but simply to all : food , clothing , education .
Without education in a poor country certainly no chance .
beginning it was the private commitment of individuals , for a few euros per year to send to school and a child to give him a warm meals day .
However , a year later , the chorus of the club founded , ' Voices for Africa , the Greens in the almost professional Aids-Waisen Esitjeni .
facts to sexually transmitted infections
sexually - transmitted diseases are the most important ?
Regarding the TSIs , bacteria Syphilis chlamydia and Tripper ( Gonorrhö ) .
Häufige viral STI Pappilomaviren Humane are HIV or hepatitis Herpes genitalis .
Filzläuse Krätze and among the parasite STI .
Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen ?
Syphilis Tripper come and , above all , in men who have sex with men .
The Robert-Koch-Institut from it is that at least four out of five of all in Germany by Syphilis-F reported cases of sexual contact between men .
In the adults are heterosexual Chlamydien-Infektionen Trichomonaden , fungal Candidose ( ) Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren major sexually - transmitted diseases .
The spread of HIV , heterosexual adults is comparatively small - but here : 20 % of new HIV infections legislate in this group .
Under Chlamydien-Infektionen young people to become much more than other groups .
After European surveys affect infections , three quarters of all young people between the ages of 15 and 25 years .
Humane Pappilomaviren Hierzulande moreover , often for young people .
As the number of infections developed ?
Not all sexually - transmitted diseases are meldepflichtig .
The number of Syphilis-Infektionen has doubled the Robert-Koch-Institut 1697 of diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases more than the year 2011 .
The number of new HIV infections is back in 2007 .
2011 , there were around 2 700 cases .
This is about a tenth of less than in the previous year .
What symptoms out highlight a Geschlechtskrankheit ?
The infectious diseases ulcers Genitalbereich , the complaints to the Urinieren , a product , or Unterbauchschmerzen and Bläschen Warzen .
Oft they do not , however , cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed .
How can we protect themselves ?
condoms can reduce the risk of infection , but not a 100 % guarantee .
Because of the virus can be passed on by sexually - transmitted diseases , by just Schmierinfektionen and close .
Therefore the experts recommend Sexpartnern frequently , in particular , regular checks .
morning most TSIs have diagnosed and cured can be avoided .
By Patenschaften , donations and not least the Gagen to the choir ersingt throughout Germany , a great deal together .
`` Overall , we have already sent around 200 000 euros after Esitjeni , Annette Lennartz says that the chairman of the associations .
The village Dlamini Zodwa itself , a self - confident and durchsetzungsstarke women , the money from Germany .
you concerned about the orphans unterkommen good one , for example the Grandmothers .
The Gogos , as it is called , to the old women Zulu are the mainstays of the village .
Some of them have been up to 14 orphans to give them a roof over their head and ensure that the children in their uniforms on every day in school classrooms .
Who has no one else , comes into Schutzhaus Khanyisile to a single woman who is paid for by the club , as well as the two cooks , every day the cook for more than 200 hungry children .
Voices also called 'for Africa has built a Nähschule , and two Hühnerhäuser together with the American health arrangements PSI that many have an HIV test in order in the village .
This is not a matter of course , because it appears that the disease is also in the whole of the country , but they would be dead .
The King with 14 wives
'AIDS is absolutely taboo , Annette Lennartz says that ' because it has to do with sexual orientation ' .
Eigentlich strange in a country where the King has officially 14 wives .
The last absolute monarch King Mswati III . of sub - Saharan Africa is known for its excessive lifestyle .
polygamy instead of democracy .
Among other things it is also due to the state - sanctioned way of life that the HIV in the last few decades has spread so quickly .
However , the many migrant workers , which bear the virus through the country .
if there were any corner Kostenlose of condoms , Annette Lennartz says , `` but are hardly used .
The culture is another - flesh to flesh ' .
In order to promote the cultural exchange , the travel Imbongi-Chor every two or three years , together with the southern Africa nostalgia , songs and is full of fighting spirit of optimism and confidence , black , know of many on the southern bit of the black continent from a period of apartheid .
A bus full of great who sing songs of language - brings so much credit not only mood and rejoicing , but some tears has also been some abgetrotzt grimmigen border guards .
The visit will always lead to Esitjeni , where the singer visit their godchildren .
Although it is not the small village of reference in the valley , the Ezulweni-Flusses it is more than well - known .
'n't Esitjeni , that is to say the people there .
And when you return the crow flies 8733 kilometres in Heidelberg , stampfenden Sängern in the Proberaum Bergheimer on the roads , then - as we see it .

'The brain is so far only moderate ' dupe those
The supporters of modern technologies in popular subject of the enlarged reality is usually recently through the lens of a specific perspective .
Firstly , in the summer , Google , at its annual meeting in November , a working model was then known that Microsoft had declared an adequate patent .
In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D-Technologien in Microsoft-Labor in Cambridge Shahram Izadi , is clear that the prism of the scientists of the company was only a staging post .
you anew the opportunity to manipulate and virtual property with their bare hands in the air to create virtual Freiflächen .
- you Beschreiben short , what research your group .
We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine , however , want to extend the limit of this interaction .
No humanity is largely remained stuck in the period in which to work with Pixeln preferably , sometimes be affected .
We , however , look to foresee 5 -10 years and the radical changes to this interaction .
Beispielsweise the Xbox-Konsole Kinect-Sensoren are a step forward , and nowadays Xbox will no longer be sold Kinect , since all the interested for Bewegungssteuerung .
What we have in the future ?
Kinect - Although the interaction of a physical level , a great deal has to play in the Flachbildschirm , sometimes in 3D .
The input of information ( the system more data ) could be improved , the issue has not yet been crucial .
We are trying to change the working , on real three - dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of different technologies , including projections .
We need to release the Computerwelt in our physical world and comprehensible .
The same applies , however , it is important that not only the users , but also its surroundings .
Then we could add to the real world of virtual objects much easier .
And these bescheuerten Virtual-Reality-Helme , first and foremost , we should be starting to happen .
What do you think about Sprachsteuerung - ?
is liked you , but they will not be exaggerated .
- it is certainly not the Allzwecklösung , since it raises questions about privacy , because it is not always Umstehenden all information about his actions and intentions .
Eigentlich any kind of interaction with computers , however , is any good , in their specific detail .
For example , we were working in the field of governance of objects in public places to a project in which we , with short and limited , rather than ausladenden experimentierten gestures .
Let the gestures were recorded Objektkamera not by the Council , but by a Armband , the registered the movements of the bones and muscles .
As it is a relatively large , could in theory be reduced to the size of a wristwatch , however .
But overall , the future belongs to , for example , joint Steuerungstypen Gestik and language .
- As this ?
We would like to ask you - for example , to offer you these Sprudeldose ?
you to say it and , at the same time .
I am normally simply .
- well , that would be very difficult to understand .
- the Heißt , you want the users adapt to what a machine can make the relevant time and what is not ?
- It is not important , but it is a mutual rapprochement .
I believe that in the next period , in particular , to the development of new types of the responses to enable more people to work .
That can be Lasersensoren for example in the depth , as they offer a good resolution , which is very important .
What you are basis of your work with the demands of modern cameras Xbox Kinect-Sensoren ?
Mangelt of disintegration , or something else ?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of the three - dimensional detection .
Of course Megapixel 8 would be at a rate of one thousand fps not bad .
However , the main not Megapixel which are themselves , but the quality of the matrix and depth .
However , all the current technologies are not good enough , since the developers of the algorithms have more work .
It is not only the disbanding along the X , Y and - but also along the Z-Achse be taken into account .
Even the speed , and the number of a second images are important .
The movements of people are extremely dynamic and open , the current 30 fps in particular gestures are too little .
Stephen Betishes in our developed in a laboratory Redmond Berührungssensor with a regulierbaren Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1 -100 Millisekunden , with today 's commercial sensors closer to the second value ( 60 and 100 ) .
Not all understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine .
To my work I had only just such an instrument without Berührungssteuerung and with more pictures per second .
- will increase the number of cameras Müsste not ?
- Kinect is currently working with three 'cameras ' , but one of them actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the date , signal .
And the third is indeed a camera ordinary RGB-Kamera .
you is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe .
More cameras may be able to solve the problem .
Oder compound the problem , because more calculations are necessary .
system would be a flexible , check Kinect - similar in which we could play with various Kameraneigungen to see us , as in the case of the three - dimensional identifying a position to provide help .
- If I remember correctly , Microsoft , in contrast to his glasses Google not the public .
thinking you not think that , as regards the use of technology in the everyday reality of the enlarged glasses , the best prospects ?
Of course , it is not always pleasant , on their way to keep in the hands of a smart phone , but I believe the following : The tollste formula would be an 'rotating ' enlarged reality , in which we have a cloud of the prism of the smart phone , could switch
The impact is a personal 'gadget ' and its strength lies ( private you can see only ) , but also , at the same time its weakness : an enlarged reality through wear glasses that you , together with others to virtual objects able to work .
- posts before us a moment that the manipulation of virtual Hologramme in the air from not only Mr Stark Iron Man , but also Normalsterblichen is accessible .
There is a problem , to the critics often this idea : There is no tangible response .
The hands feel nothing !
What answers to give your group on this point ?
- In my lectures I often talk about the importance of the extended reality of the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine .
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of taktilen perception .
An interesting method currently use of second - hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage .
you true takes pressure excellent .
There are , however , also technologies which are actually designed to 'pictures in the air ' , something concrete to , for example , the number of collisions Ultraschallstrahlen aimed at a certain point , the finger is a feeling that at the moment , but so is weak , as someone Handballen pustete on .
It also ties to the Commission on the Nervenendungen in the fingers of one hand , this is also a possible way .
Have you tried to dupe those , the brain ?
There I think that what the European Union should see it , if it is just a little ?
- This is a good idea , so we still have not tried it .
Here is another task with which we will have to fight for a long time , namely a person physically in a closed area , to believe that he was instead in an open , virtually never - ending area ; we are working on concepts with Laufbändern ( other than in gyms too ) , mobile platforms and major bullets .
No , the brain , and only moderately dupe those before us for many years of hard work for .
That is precisely the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher rather this : In many issues we are only just beginning .

In Colorado , there are no clear guideline for the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-j - year Community College-Student and footballers Anthony Orozco in the south - east is Colorados court for a crime in that Member State will soon be legal , the possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a tune with which he rauchte this .
Orozco , were he and some friends Septembertag a car in Lamar close to the border with Kansas , as they were travelling .
Following the police officers marijuana they appear in the car - Orozco has been found for the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien excusable peccadilloes received , each with a fine of USD 100 - and a court hearing .
'We are being treated like criminals ' , Orozco .
But it is also a ?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalise small quantities of marihuana , to find the answer depends less on hundreds of smaller drug offences by the law , as the location .
hundreds of regulatory offence for marijuana be , here and in the state of Washington , the approved similar measures , already abandoned .
The police forces are adults on 21 years ago no longer for the possession of small extent . This is legally permitted , as soon as the new laws in the next few weeks to come into force .
But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced to quote , existing Marihuanadelikte and people are still in a court of law .
Regarding the same time , several cities in the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountain about new state to prevent Marihuanageschäfte licensed in the opening in their communities .
'This situation is developing so quickly that I do not know what the next step will be to be done , Mr J. Oates says Aurora police chief in the east , in Denver .
And even regulators in the State is therefore a Washington on the head .
you are waiting for a report on the establishment of the licensing systems of production , production , distribution and sale of drugs - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013 .
In Washington , we are of the opinion that , in any case , Colorado the majority of States , which is the subject of the regulation of marijuana . drugs legalised , which was only for medical purposes , and then Eigenkonsum .
'Colorado has a more regulated market . The state is therefore right for the orientation , Brian E. Smith said , the spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington .
But to Smith also that no place or system more than in the sense of a broad guidelines to be able to do that .
'We have no real precedent which can we follow ' , he added .
The Washington I-502 law , on 6 December , to enter into force and thus represents the end point in a grey area in which the State licensing system to legalise possession , but still does not exist .
And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be clarified in this period , for example , such as the imposition of a state 'adequate access to ' lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften around 300 metres for schools , parks , playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed .
'nowhere it will be difficult to find a location for a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas , in particular in the agglomeration of Seattle , Ben Livingston thinks that the spokesman for the ' legal 'Centre for cannabis , a recent research group formed .
On 21 November Chief Oates his staff in Aurora sent an e - mail , in which he stated that the public prosecutor would inherit Marihuanadelikte people no longer than 21 years , and that the police do not want 'immediately ' Strafanzeigen for these crimes .
Chief Oates added that the police to continue to implement urban plans for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers will continue to be persecuted .
In the north County Weld Colorados Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken Buck represents a stricter view .
After the vote on its authority , would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz , mainly in order to move to consumers .
Aktuell 119 people responsible must be in possession of around 50 grams a court or marijuana , although many others were accused of offences .
'Our authority has the duty to pursue infringements , which was the Tatzeitpunkt crimes ' Buck , in a declaration .
The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County , where the voters Marihuana-Initiative , ambivalent .
The police in Grand Junction , the largest city of Landkreises , shows the possession of small quantities of adults .
Bezirksstaatsanwalt Pete Hautzinger supported this decision , but decided not to let all outstanding Besitzverfahren .
'I do not believe that I mean wastes time , the right to impose it , he says ' change .
Although 55 % of the voters in Colorado , supported by the measure at the beginning that it was compatible with the personal consumption of marihuana , with the complexities of the government and the legal system would not be easy .
And the contradictory reactions in the whole state , local officials expended a great struggle with regard to the big green experiment .
In Bezirksstaatsanwälten if it were a `` cultural barrier , Sean McAllister says that a lawyer in Denver , which represents Marihuanadelikte to court and defendants on the ground as spokesperson for the national organisation for the reform of Marihuanagesetzen operates .
'you have spent so that such a large part of their lives to prosecute people for the fact that they are still unable to accept the legalisation , it believes in .
The first states , the smaller quantities of marihuana , such as alcohol , Colorado and Washington to be treated as a national Musterfälle for the legalization of drugs .
As defenders and civil servants at the age of legal sale of them at the same time to prepare , nervous orders of the German Government , which treat the sale and the cultivation of marijuana to continue to act as a federal level .
advocate the Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the Department of Justice will give in .
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas the Federal German Government to allow the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado , Washington and 16 for most other countries .
Kevin A. Sabet , former Drogenpolitik-Berater the Obama administration is of the opinion that Kriminalbeamte probably not be in order to seize the smaller quantities of drugs which , under the new legislation , a legal , state - regulated Marihuana-Gesch forces are to be , but we are probably
There are various cities in Colorado not wait for that the federal authorities .
As approved before the elections , some local municipalities forces moratoria on new Marihuana-Gesch , although this is only about a year could be opened up .
Last week , a town Montrose decided in the West , a six - month ban which will probably be adopted next week .
'We do not want to end up in a position in which we at federal level licence and then someone who have a huge problem , as Mr Nicholson , municipal councillor .
Our community has voted against this amendment .
We have , then , for which the Community has decided , and not according to which the state has decided .
A number of questions remain open .

A Constitution with the battering in Egypt
It is a new game of poker of President , Mohammed Mursi .
While Egypt with regard to the temporary Verfassungserklärung , the unlimited power , more than ever , it is still divided , has decided to put everything on a card .
Regarding the surprise of all he has delivered on the Wednesday of the constituent assembly , the next day will adopt its final version .
It is just a week ago , the Head of State has given to this House the two more months to complete its work .
Egypt is now for nearly two years ago , in a provisional text amended several times , which weakens and institutional stability leads to a legal confusion .
This new initiative only provides for greater division of the country .
For his opponents of the President remains in its ' autocratic ended by 'to ' break 'and ' be the right word 'being trampled underfoot .
On pages of his supporters , you assured us that it is the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process is a way .
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held .
A very short period of time , the forced to abandon the brothers on their projects , the Egyptians to explain the text for paragraph of paragraph .
For the President , it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy , while the protest is raging across the country .
After the contrary , in an interview with the American Wochenschau Time Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians to vote favourably .
Zumal an ultimatum the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote , put it : ' is true for my draft or I reserve the right to unlimited power ' , the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution are supposedly an end .
85 largely Islamic members of the constituent assembly , the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere .
The majority of the Liberal Group has not responded to the call .
short Verfassungserklärung before the middle of November they have warded off , as they are of the opinion that they have not been able to put their views are promoted .
representatives of human rights organisations , religious minorities and civil society have acted in the same way .
To achieve the quorum yesterday morning were added in a hurry , 11 people members .
Some are very close to the Moslembrüdern .
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously .
The commentators have enjoyed incidentally , that the only difference of the day in the late hour for the prayer is to say , as some members of the committee were of the opinion that the Pendeluhr the Constituent Assembly was not exactly .
The text that was adopted yesterday evening , is 234 articles .
Article 2 , which drew attention to all who , after all , the same as that of the Constitution from 1971 and states that 'the principles of the Sharia law are the main source of the law ' .
The salafistischen parties , for the establishment of the Islamic law is an important requirement , had hoped to replace the principles of 'by the rules , which would have made it possible for a stricter application .
For the Islamists the fact is that this article has not changed , to demonstrate its good will and on their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society .
'hypocrisy ' , the Liberals say that this only as Propagandaschlag .
Because the Islamisation of them is through other articles of the constitution .
Mr President , you have in mind particularly Article 220 of the University of Al-Azhar placed a consultative role , particularly in relation to the review of the conformity with the laws of the Sharia .
According to Mrs Ägyptenspezialistin Pommier this is worrying , because the people who will be called on to give its opinion , have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
You can see that the first signs of a theocracy ' .
The fears of the Liberals also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the University of much less than the present should be measured .
'At no specific religious commitment to see .
With this Constitution , we remain within the framework of the civil state .
The majority of lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema but academics , some of which have been trained in the French system , Alexis Blouet appeased , which lays down a thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition .
He is a recognised that 'but in relation to Article 220 there is an ambiguity , because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary .
It is here , in particular , to the 'Fiqh ' [ Islamic law , red , Mr President .
And in the future could be raised the question of the extent to which Zivilrichter are competent to decide ' .
In his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday , heavily criticised because of the far - reaching powers and the President of the Republic .
The known as Muslim Brothers argue that this comparison with the former regime are significantly reduced .
A further point of contention : the power of the army .
In accordance with the wishes of the military , not Parliament , which will be put to the test , but just a national Defence Council .
Just there is no ban on civil proceedings , as requested in military courts the human rights associations .
latter with also share her concerns in relation to the text that they see as freiheitsbedrohend .
The offence of blasphemy , and insults are now banned , which have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
I also have no article refers more to the protection of women , underlines Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch .
your opinion , the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36 .
This word was not included in the previous constitution .
During the Egyptian President , yesterday evening on the television demonstrations that are planned for today had this afternoon .
The supporters of the Head of State on Saturday will be .

The offline private is offline online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary , it is the property privately or `` the area of private life , where they have the right to protection from any type of interference . ''
What is private for someone under the age of 16 ?
This definition applied to your everyday life and the social networks ?
He understands the risks to which he exposes himself , if he is in the Internet situations that he would not share in real life ?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years , which are often in the network .
In four of the cases of the term `` something very own '' on a personal level , and on the password and user `` when they apply it to the social networks .
`` My deepest secrets , I would not be known in a post office , '' says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of `` private '' on websites such as Facebook , Twitter , Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger , where he has for two years .
`` These are very confidential secrets , my mother , but not the whole world , '' he confirmed .
On FB I invite beautiful images or images of games .
I think my time with friends .
`` I would not share a photo that is not for me , or someone who makes a fool , '' he says .
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked , from crime to write or abusive or violent comments .
Jorge assured 35 friends , he has in FB and nine Folger in Twitter .
Most of them are relatives .
Including the mother , who has the password to one of the accounts .
I reported on to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets .
`` I do not know if someone responds to me , I invite them high , '' he added .
`` The social networks are entertaining , I can speak with relatives or friends , in the distance , '' he states .
He says that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger .
Even if someone a stranger to him , he would ignore it .
The case of The 14-year-old Jose is different .
The teenager has accounts into Hotmail , Facebook , My Space and Ask . In Ask , not to know 20 of The people , he has attached his friends list .
`` It scares me not because we have something in common , such as music , '' he admits .
No one , according to the has made him hints or asked for his address or phone number .
`` If someone afflicted me or asked me , I remove it from my account , '' he admits .
José Ask , after he had read in Twitter a recommendation .
The boy experiences are not unknown , known as .
The friend of a friend was in a social network .
They threatened him and demanded money .
`` He has never know who it was , '' he assured .
According to José the victim did the account was not closed .
`` He has made it private . ''
Then he explained a number of steps to configure an user account .
In contrast to this boy Jorge would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations .
Yes , I would do if he is unsympathetic or I want to me .
`` But I know that this is , '' he says .
Key questions
Marielos Porras , a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning , says that the children and young people , must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks .
`` The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information , with the release of these pages have changed the rules of the game , '' she says .
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky , owner of a Masters title in education at the University of Yale and the author of the `` digital natives and Immigrants '' these words to explain the phenomenon .
They are The digital natives , The children and young people who grew up with this technology .
`` We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them where we learn , '' he says .
He said that it is a complex issue , `` because we ask them , that they have a defined criteria about what should be published or , said in an age where the maturity is not enough . ''
`` They should also be picky when it is the most important to be popular , to have thousands of friends , without thinking about the consequences , '' he adds .
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people , which is privacy , to ask them questions that they thought .
`` To tell you , they are not To do not work , '' he says .
Porras calls after some possibilities : there are things that you would not tell a stranger , why are you doing it on the Internet ?
Or : would you like it published a photo of you , as you posted from a friend ?
Do you know what the others about you ?
The other people you 've asked for permission , if you have pictures of celebrations labelled ?
And another question : do you need to know what you are doing at any moment ?
Another point is to make them to understand that they must act as they do offline .
They are the same rules .
`` Someone outside of the Internet with respect , morality and other principles , and the same should apply to the social networks , '' he says .
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia , university professor , primary school teacher and educational consultant , says that it is essential that parents read carefully the of the social networks .
If they understand all of them , they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one user account on the Internet .
`` For example , the age , or what you should share or publish , '' he says .
According to Guardia , the children of the lesson `` thou shalt not talk to strangers '' .

His film work included roles in `` the Group , '' `` Harry and Tonto '' and `` Primary Colors '' by the criticism .
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting despicable J.R. , made Hagman a superstar .
The dramatic series of the television network CBS about the Ewing clan and other figures in the surrounding area was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991 .
The slogan `` who shot J.R. ? , '' to create the expectation for an episode full of emotions , where the figure was killed by Hagmann almost led to an international speculation and millions of dollars have been bet in betting houses .
In the series reached a record in that time .
When the answer in a chapter in November 1990 , it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers , the `` Dallas '' in the second most popular entertainment program since the end of `` MASH '' in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers , transformed .
It was Kristin , J.R. , the sister-in-law of ( interpreted by Mary Crosby ) had been shot .
He had made and threatening to portray them as prostitutes , if they are not the city , but others had reasons to want to see him dead .
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt , greedy man with a charismatic smile : a devious businessman and husband , who sought his wife Sue Ellen ( Linda Gray ) .
`` I know what to put on the tombstone of J.R. , '' said Hagman 1988 .
It should read `` here rests the honourable citizen J.R . Ewing . ''
This is the only business that he has not won .
Victoria Principal , Mitdarstellerin of the original series , recalled on Friday to Hagman as a `` huge personality in and outside of the screen . ''
It is for millions of fans around the world unforgettable and irreplaceable , and we have had the good fortune to know him and to love in our hearts .
Ten episodes of the new edition of `` Dallas '' aired a few months ago with great success in the television channel TNT .
The inclusion of five chapters for the second season was completed , and a sixth chapter has just been , told the station .
From Warner or TNT , there was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann in the series .
Born in Fort Worth , Texas , he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin , the classic works such as `` South Pacific '' and `` Peter Pan . ''
Martin was a young people when he got Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman .
He tried his luck on the theater in New York in the early 1950s , after He served from 1952 to 1956 in the air forces in England .

The Interior ministry ignored illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons to extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the law for private gun owners .
The authorities respond to recent events : injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the shooting of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow .
The police want to ban the wearing of lethal weapons in the public and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years .
The proposal , the chairman of the Duma committee on security and corruption , Irina Jarowaja , supported and promised that the changes to the arms law will soon be submitted to the Duma .
Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by `` attraction of the screws . ''
An open letter published on the Internet , the author - representatives of various armed groups - are the authorities of `` senseless . ''
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low , the Strafrechtler , Wasilij Lesnikow , the Russian service of the BBC .
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012 , while a total of 1.168 offences were recorded for the same period .
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals from it , to serve on the black market .
At present , you can , according to the authors of in Moscow every possible weapon for little money .
Meanwhile , the Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control .
Suppliers : from the factories to officers
The weapons through multiple channels on the black market .
There are five main channels , says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez , who was ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff .
Screenshot of a website that accepts orders
The first channel is the army or the military , i.e . weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus .
`` The weapons were stolen from both the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern themselves , '' says .
On the second channel illegal weapons , the are stolen by criminals .
Baranez explained that these weapons that were stolen from both the of the police and by employees of the law enforcement authorities .
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals .
In many military camps were frequent explosions .
`` There is evidence that in some cases , arson was to cover up the lack of weapons , '' says the former military personnel .
According to make a contribution to the black market in the arms manufacturers .
`` Today there are countless private arms factories , which do not stand up to the international competition and therefore the weapons on the black market , , in Moscow , does not , '' says the expert .
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling .
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan .
`` There is a separate , sometimes small-scale production , as well as a mafia , organized smuggling , '' says the former military personnel .
Where are the weapons come from ?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market in illegal weapons .
In 2011 , a report by the center for analysis and public administration .
The experts analyzed reports from the Interior Ministry and the federal service for National statistics , forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons .
The vast majority of illegal weapons , according to the investigators from the army and the legal protection authorities .
Half of all weapons on the black market were to go through the `` guilt by the work of with weapons , '' the report .
The data , according to the researchers , 17 % of the weapons come from conflict zones , 14 % of thefts in weapons production , and 5 % comes from illegal excavations .
A sales adviser of a gun shop , which does not want to be named , assured that weapons for a long time , no one is buying weapons found in illegal excavations , because they are outdated .
According to him , it is more likely that traders get supplies in a military camp .
A Ensign is a weapon , for example , a pistol from the TT type bought .
The weapon will be issued and pass through the fence .
`` The dealers brings the weapon in the city and sold them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines , '' he told
`` The police know , of course about everything , if it can not comply with the plan for the detection of crime , periodically purchases by offering illegal weapons , '' adds the sales consultant .
`` As in the luxury store ''
Most of Buyers and sellers find each other .
I have seen websites and blogs , as someone who has been to me , and I suggested to the station , `` Begowaja '' where a person would wait for me , I would bring in a certain place where we could then negotiate the price .
The price for the weapon I learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
`` In order to get a gun , I need a friend , who has contacts , '' says the sales consultant . `` I have a friend , but I do not trust him . ''
There are traders in the markets , but you have to go and with a code as `` Ivan Iwanowitsch , who is that the daughter has lost a tooth . ''
I come to some shot rings on a friend whom I trust .
It gives me the rings just because he knows that I do not verpfeife .
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways .
The former soldiers , Viktor Baranez tried in the as a buyer of illegal weapons , when he wrote an article on this subject .
The has not changed according to him .
He got a photo album , in which `` everything possible '' was .
`` I felt like the luxury store , '' recalls the military personnel .
The buyer gets , according to a pig in a poke , but can try everything .
I do not buy a potential customer , but with the seller in the forest , and that is where we are a target .
`` I can shoot there , and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot , we are negotiating with each other , '' the expert describes the action .
From your couch
Internet search engine results show to Web pages and groups in `` Vkontakte , where weapons are available for different purposes . ''
It will not require any papers , there are personal meetings .
`` You only need just the right amount of money , '' it says in the advertisement on the website `` pistol or rifle . ''
There is your orders and .
Also to be sold to minors ?
`` Of course , without a license , '' asks users `` Ivan '' ( direct quote ) .
`` Buy a TT . Moscow , '' is the laconic question of `` Fedorenkow . ''
The Federal Security service , recently a number of bogus websites , and buyers who want to acquire the weapons abound , the service into the net .
The people are like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in Siberia and coal must stop money
Military commentator and former soldiers , Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following way : the site is normally registered abroad , and Russian laws do not apply .
The orders .
The buyer transfers The money .
`` In response he receives a photo and a description of the of the weapon , '' the spokesman of the non-profit organization `` Pravo na oryzhie '' Dmitry Kislow .
Viktor Baranez stressed that at the end , and can be behind bars , if you have a question on a web page .
The Federal Security service , recently a number of bogus websites , and buyers who want to acquire the weapons abound , the service into the net .
`` People come like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in the Siberian labor camp and must stop pouring money into coal , '' he says .
A Makarow for $ 100
With the purchase of illegal firearms , according to experts , with prices ranging from 100 to 900 US dollars .
`` You can buy a gun , According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization '' Pravo na oryzhie type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars .
You have to wait up to one and a half months .

A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the Brennan Center for , the latter is a myth , and that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning .
The attorneys for the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States , , only 300 cases of electoral fraud .
One thing is certain : these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout .
In this sense , some of these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States .
In contrast to Canada , the united states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states .
In this sense , the majority of the American governments since 2009 , has announced new laws to make it difficult for the procedures for the registration or .
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections in November 2010 , in which the new Republican representatives in 26 states .
As a result , 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone , which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states .
The new election laws that require voters to present photo identification and proof of citizenship .
In addition , these laws also shorten the period for early voting , the to register as voters on election day , and denied citizens the right to vote , for which a court .
Before the elections of 2006 , no US state has asked voters to present photo identification .
Indiana was the first state , which has made such a request .
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in the year 2008 .
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states .
Over the last two years , to in 34 states , which forced the voters to produce photo identification .
It is important to note that the US citizens , in contrast to do not unlike Quebec on a universal ID card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of US citizens , 21 million people no photo identification issued by a governmental authority of their state .
In addition , five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card .
However , there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to get the required identification .
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected low-income young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
In fact , 25 % of African-Americans , 15 % of those with an income of less than $ 35,000 , 18 % of people over 65 years and 20 % of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo identification .
This goes further .
The students who are seen as voters increasingly cast their votes for Democratic candidates in several states , it is not allowed to use their photo id issued by The establishment .
On the other hand , the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs , which is On the Republican side , to the cards issued by these clubs to use for elections .
Before 2004 , no state has asked for proof of citizenship for voting .
Arizona was the first federal state , who introduced such a requirement .
Since 2011 , a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship .
These measures are clearly , to limit the Hispanic votes .
Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party .
In addition , Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 in eight states laws , with the registration of voters on election day .
In addition , you have the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register .
These restrictions are not without consequences .
For example , the campaigns have contributed to the voter registration in the 2004 general election to register some 10 million citizens .
The measures adopted since 2009 , the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17 % compared to 2006 .
In addition , the Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws , which aim to shorten the period for early voting .
For example , in the general election in Florida in 2008 , 33 % of voters who voted in advance , African-Americans , even though they represent only 13 % of voters in the state .
The same is true of the Hispanic population .
The latter was only 11 % of the electorate , but 24 % of the citizens who voted in advance .
In contrast , the White , 76 % of the voters , only 46 % of voters who voted in advance .
Of course , the democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters .
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors .
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws .
They were able to limit the damage .
For example , only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the of a photo ID .
However , the newly introduced rules in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote .
The Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the results in the 2012 key states .
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws , which make up 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college , in order to win the presidency .
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012 .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout .
In this sense , some of these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States .

Rakfisk from Norway : is this the übelriechendste fish in the world ?
Norway 's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not just in Europe , but around the world .
Could the secret to the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish ?
Take a selection of overripe cheese .
It is in the middle of a pile of dirty , humid sports clothing .
And leave it there for a week .
So you have to think about the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk , one of the great delights of Norway .
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes , about three hours away from Oslo .
There is snow , spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air , which just wo n't go away .
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout , which , depending on how you would have stinky fish would like - up to a year in water is fermented .
If the darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather gets colder Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes , which is dedicated to this , well , really .
`` You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass of aquavit , '' says Harvard Halvarsen , who works in the local fire station , but as a so-called `` Rakfisk general '' also organized the festival .
Around us , people eat small fish cubes and take large quantities of alcohol .
`` Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk , '' says Harvard .
The Spirituose can crowd out the smell .
I eat a .
If it avoids the Rakfisk in , he is not bad - like sushi , which has quite a long bus ride .
Rakfisk is the product of a very different , much poorer Norwegian era , when there were no cooling and fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels .
In the deepest winter , he was taken out after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol .
A generation ago thousands of Norwegians in search of work , forced to leave their country and in the United States .
Today , the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by a booming labor market , high wages and a comprehensive health care .
Even from Sweden , the old rivals , who not long ago was far richer than Norway , are immigrants .
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential , albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history .
He is one of the more expensive meals , which you can buy here .
But here , it is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs 10 euros .
Norway does not often in the world press , and most people do not seem to interfere with that .
Here you hate it still , to name Anders Breivik - those racist right-wing extremist , who last year 77 men , women and children shot .
Instead , it refers only to the `` incident on 22 July . ''
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in the country .
The main responsibility for today 's wealth of Norway is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien since the early 1970s , the growth of the world .
`` But oil is not the only reason why we are so good , '' says Anna , our waitress , with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes , the round trays with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal .
We are , as they say , prudent people .
Her English is just like that of most people here .
We are not very angeberisch , we may not boasting .
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry for the benefit of future generations is invested in a special fund .
As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis all threw money around , that they do not have anything , Norway closed its wallet .
`` As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer , we are happy , '' says Anna .
`` And , of course , Rakfisk eat , '' she adds with easy laughter .
I am standing in the snow and ask for another court , I have had enough of Rakfisk .
Such a moose burger is something else . The juicy meat mundet me .
But in the evening , on the menu .
The hotel , in which I logiere , is one of several locations that , which can organise a Rakfisk Dinner , where guests for the best - or perhaps the sense of smell the most challenging - fish .
There is a live TV circuit with a fly to show master , which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk .
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest .
`` What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish , thor Jürgen ? ''
`` Are our points , . ''
Applause and laughs .
A man falls from his chair , may be overwhelmed by the aquavit .
But perhaps it is the severe haze of the whole fish .

Mexico 's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico 's incoming president Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his arrival , Will Grant by the BBC , the challenges and the mixed feelings of its people .
Currently , the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad .
Even in better days , this is a congested city , but on Monday a ring of steel , several important transport routes in the capital , and on the streets for chaos .
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on the way to work , but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament .
On Saturday , Mexico 's new president Enrique Pena Nieto , the will and the leadership of the nation .
He faces a complex task .
Under the outgoing government of President Felipe Calderon 's Mexico could prove economically , but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives over the past six years .
`` My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence , '' Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office of the U.S. President Barack Obama .
I will propose a new security strategy that we can achieve this goal .
Before he went to the US president on an equal footing , Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico .
In this densely populated , large part of the country , which surrounds the capital , opinions are divided on the new head of state .
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo , for example , remembered him .
Residents of the write the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure .
In order to reach the city , you can drive on one of the highways , Pena Nieto built and a great improvement on the fragile , bumpy roads , which .
With his name outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change .
`` We expect him real and lasting change , '' his friend and political ally , Gabriel Olvera Hernandez , who works as a congressman for the party , Pena Nietos , the PRI .
In particular , with regard to the security and economy , we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs .
After 81 years in power , the PRI was replaced in the year 2000 by Vicente Fox .
The Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto .
The accusations of the opposition , the new president lacks substance , he rejects .
He is a very direct guy , very committed and have great plans for the country .
He was an outstanding statesman , above all , he is also someone who can listen .
But on the other side of the state , many people do not share this view of their former governor .
In Nezahualcoyotl , also known as Ciudad Neza , In contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater .
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and is in many ways , a suburb of Mexico City itself .
And the problems in the community are of critical urban nature .
Earlier this year , the military to fight the drug gangs operating in the districts , and violence against women is a particularly acute problem .
On a marginal land near a large landfill were left alone , the bodies of dozens of murdered women in the last two years .
During the term of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the state of Mexico , more than 1000 women - a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez , which is notorious for its violence and the killings of innocent women .
The critics Pena Nietos believe that he is the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least not adequately addressed .
But in the worst case , his government closed their eyes to the problem .
In a concrete , typical of the district , Irinea Buendia with tears , as she shows me pictures of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna .
According to The official version of events , Mariana 2010 committed suicide .
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner .
`` When I arrived at her home , it seemed as if her body had been washed , '' recalls Senora Buendia .
There were signs that she was beaten , and the body had already begun .
While her mother tells her story , from the wall a picture of Mariana look down on us . It is next to a cross bearing a single word : justice .
But it is precisely this , the family , so far denied .
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin , Nörglerin .
They want you to accept their verdict and the mouth .
`` But that is not possible when there were so many flaws and omissions , '' she says .
If president Pena Nieto on Saturday , the president , he takes a big responsibility .
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crimes , and the new president has promised to take care of this problem , particularly during his time in office .
`` I hope that as president he is , as he was as governor , '' says the Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo .
But that is the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most fear .

Born in space
Earth at risk .
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid .
Caravans of space ships with Erdbewohnern on board to the search for a replacement .
In order to save the human race , the important question is , how we can reproduce In the , or on the planet ?
There are many choices , in my opinion .
De facto , there are only two real planet , which we could at least hypothetically .
`` Mars and Venus , '' says the scientific staff of the astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin .
But , while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life , on the surface of Venus is a temperature of 500 degrees .
Life would be at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus , in space .
The issue of reproduction in space , the researchers first in relation to the flora .
Half a century before experiments with plants have already been carried out .
The fourth generation of the peas bred in orbit , not all of the species .
It was followed by the breeding of insects , tiny fruit flies ( Drosophila ) in orbit .
In the year 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to explore how microgravity affects the development of embryos .
It is becoming a normal chicks .
But then the trouble begins .
`` The problem is that the chickens must stop ; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move , '' said the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN , Vladimir Sychew .
Without a solid surface over the .
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn .
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds .
Four days later she died .
`` We have two chicks hatch and then the whole thing , because it is simply impossible to work with them , '' Vladimir Sychew the failed experiment with the chicks in space .
The last breeding kennel with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago .
In the spring of 2013 , the experiments will continue .
However , But on the Biosatelliten `` Bion '' only same-sex species .
There was an experiment with rats that have already been fertilized sent into space .
In principle , it was nothing special .
`` That was with the Biosatelliten , but again , it was only a single experiment , and the research should be continued , '' said Vladimir Sychew .
After the landing , the space rats .
Could not solve The issue of reproduction in space so far .
The task is difficult .
Animals that are ripped from their natural habitat , can not follow their reproductive drive .
Unlike animals , humans could in principle .
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background .
For ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments .
But women fly for 50 years .
It was The biggest risk in Tereshkova .
The most precious , humanity is the female body .
Our gull flew , and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question : is it the space flight ?
After this flight , Will be able to bring a child into the world ?
`` After all , no one answered the question , '' says space veteran guard Tang Watschnadse .
In June 1964 , just a year after their space flight , gave birth to the first female cosmonaut , Valentina Tereshkova , a daughter .
The father of The child , Andrijan Nikolajew , was also .
In 1988 to the second woman in space , Svetlana Sawizkaja , who was twice in orbit , and even work outside of the , a son .
However , there remains a risk .
We have only very few cosmonaut , where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring .
`` The more , the more dangerous it is for flights into orbit , '' concludes cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow , hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation .
And yet , the human race for new ways in biotechnology , the radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity .
The laboratory in the preparation of the cosmonaut is a mandatory station during the flight .
Here in limbo , the cosmonauts routine for work in the open space .
The water is The weightlessness .
Even if adults water as a , it is a foreign environment , but babies water as a natural element .
It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony to the fact that the life of the country rose from the ocean .
There is a connection between the fact that a child is approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid , and that it is easier to get used to water .
In principle , it is logical , from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks .
`` This is too little time to forget something , '' says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa .
As for a newborn child , the weightlessness is a much more natural state , the woman is not without gravity .
In the state of the and pelvic muscles , and the ability to extract the child .
Well , we deal with .
The birth , for example , could take place in a special chamber in order to extract the child .
`` But what happens then ? '' Is the not insignificant matter of .
On the other hand , the child also needs artificial gravity .
Without the gravitational pull of the organism can not train the skeleton and muscles .
A newborn child could not be put in orbit as an adult for training in a suit .
He is just missing what is of fundamental importance for his life .
`` This experiment , which will bring together , the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to a disabled person , a completely people to the world , '' says the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN , Igor Pestow .
So far , the birth of children in the universe theory .
At some point , but it will become reality if the people in their space ships to a distant planet , which is the home for their offspring born in the .

Szabo : `` Germans must play a greater role . ''
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine .
According to Stephen Szabo , an expert on US-European relations , with Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level .
Deutsche Welle : at the beginning of the week , Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations .
But Berlin abstained .
Why ?
Stephen Szabo : Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza .
Germany now has to be careful , however , because of its special relationship with Israel .
But at the same time , I believe that it does not support the American position .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without , however , be too critical of Israel .
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany also abstained from the vote , when it came to set up a no-fly zone .
This was , after all , enforced by NATO .
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues ?
Yes , that is true .
That is because it is from his foreign policy , away from a policy that were managed by the United States , a German foreign policy .
To make matters worse , the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy .
The Germans are in the .
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role , but they are not accustomed to .
I think of their role , but they are on the way to a more `` normal '' foreign policy .
A foreign policy , as they have France or Britain .
What does a `` normal '' foreign policy from a German point of view ?
It shows a willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent from those of the United States or European partners .
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of the exports and its relations with certain regions , such as Russia , China or the Middle East .
Germany 's economic interests are different from those of the other major powers , to a certain extent , and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests .
These economic interests have an impact on the in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN ?
On the one hand , Germany has large markets in the Middle East , particularly in the Gulf States .
That is why it must be careful not to alienate the public , but also the elites in the Arab countries .
In any case , which plays a role .
But I would not want to give too much weight , it is not a totally one-sided relationship .
But in any case , it plays an important role in German thinking .
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States , by the important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine ?
I believe in Europe and even in the United States , there is a lot of sympathy for the German position .
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic collapse , as in the Libyan issue .
Maybe Germany will even some respect .
Because it signals that it must be taken into account as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests .
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe .
The United States have called for a veto .
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations ?
As a result of American domestic politics these differences have always existed .
I believe that the government under Obama has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position .
But due to the political situation here , the government can not represent this position publicly , of course .
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they appear .
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu , Obama is not at all , are we talking about Netanyahu 's policies .
It is difficult to Germany , its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand , and the position of the main partners in the EU , on the other side ?
I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans .
Of course , it would be a little easier for the Germans , if there is a coherent and unified European policy , which is not currently the case .
So they can not be part of a wider line and have instead things from their own position .
They are with the euro .
I believe that in the future , Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position .
Of course , this is not easy for Germany , because of the relationship with Israel .
This has always been a sensitive issue .
But I believe that the Germans , it is clear that they must play a more independent role .
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a leading role ?
Germany is still the lead or ?
Germany is still not used to it , that is still unpleasant , and for obvious reasons , it is still hard to play a greater role .
If we look at , for example , the euro crisis , because every time Germany takes on a greater role in various anti-German feelings .
That does not make it easy for the Germans .
This is the old problem : you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries .
In Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States .
It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy .
Now , the influence of the United States in European politics , not the EU fills the vacuum at the moment but who is ?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role .
Even if they do not like them , it is unpleasant , and it is Even more unpopular - c'est la vie !

In the US fast food and supermarket workers strike
One in four American adolescents when behind the cash register of Mc Donald 's
In the past few days , there have been the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald 's , Burger King , Taco Bell , Wendy 's and Kentucky Fried Chicken .
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to , or whether they are out of the again soon .
The protests are supported by unions and several leftist non-profit organizations .
In addition to the increase In the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers , the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions .
So far , this sector of the economy is hardly unionized .
46 cents in the year ?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving , the so-called Black Friday in the United States took place , which attracted millions of customers , which sometimes led to Handgemengen .
On this day , some Walmart employees , of which there are 2.2 million worldwide , their work and together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain , which targets individuals with people of low and .
Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners , eggs and milk .
The goods in the Walmart stores is , on average , between 8 and 27 % cheaper than in large supermarkets .
That is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees on the work .
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart , one of the largest companies in the United States .
Critics say Walmart can sell the goods are often so cheaply , because the employees are poorly paid .
The latter also complain of serious conditions , such as lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners .
The participants in the protests on `` Black Friday '' demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution to the health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
A typical Walmart employee who earns 9.5 dollars an hour , could not afford the increase , they said .
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour , it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars .
That is about 1.1 % more than they now pay .
If Walmart , the wage increases would pass on to customers , each purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future .
They compared to this would be a year for additional spending of just 12.39 dollars .
Advocates of Walmart note with satisfaction that it was only in nine states to protests and no losses to the company .
The Black Friday took in his shop from 8 in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day , and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second .
All in all , the on `` Black Friday '' nearly 100 million transactions .
The spokesman of the company , Dan Fogelman , claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington post that a `` less than five '' Walmart employees work , and the protest is only `` another PR stunt , '' the union , which organized the protests .
`` Free cash ! ''
The protests this week in New York , where their does not , however , Walmart stores ( which are not in this progressive city , and that is why so far non-existent ) , but McDonald 's and other inexpensive restaurants .
McDonald 's says that the companies sell billions of chickens , and yet you granted no sick days , and you will not be paid for your honest work .
Jumaane Williams , a member of the New York City Council
Currently , the minimum wage is in accordance with federal and New York legislation 7.25 dollars an hour .
The minimum wage will be increased gradually in fast food restaurants , but not too much , and on average , get their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars an hour .
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city .
As it is possible to live in New York with so little money , is incomprehensible to me .
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald 's stood behind the counter , but the young people were living with their parents .
Hardly anyone saw this as the main source of income , or planned to stay there .
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald 's , people who complain that they have to feed this wage and sometimes even their children .
On the other hand , there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper the Wall Street Journal , the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children , if you did n't know how to eat .
The participants in the protests , which on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of the McDonald 's began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue , demanded that the cashiers and cooks from fast food restaurants a minimum wage of $ 15 per hour , which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage .
They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry .
The US law prohibits the to stand in the way of this objective and union members to admonish or .
On the other hand , the management does not make it easy for them .
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry , but it is also difficult for objective reasons .
The main reason is the high staff turnover .
Unhappy
The protests on this day , there were many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan .
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon before the McDonald 's in Times Square , where some local Democrats , including city Council member Jumaane Williams , who said : `` McDonald 's says it sell billions of chickens , and yet you granted no sick days , and you will not pay for your honest work . ''
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats , for example , mayor Bill De Blasio , who said that `` we should support the fast food workers so that they can achieve a fair wage and economic prosperity every New Yorker ! . ''
According to the New York Times , this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry .
However , only a few hundred people were on the ground , which is far from all of them are employed in the fast-food industry , in the work in New York tens of thousands .
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole mass .

The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution .
Last week , the constitutional court of the law on charitable work .
That decision in a lively discussion in the public .
It is interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective .
The liberal oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition .
In effect , this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other .
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free , free movement of private capital , with rampant financial speculation goes hand in hand .
Due to the large differences in the value of work ( wages ) , it comes to price tensions .
Under this concept is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to compete with cheaper goods in economic competition , `` in order to grab a larger market share by the competition '' and to increase its profits .
On a large scale , this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap , or give up their business . The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs .
Private capital is no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for the rise in unemployment caused , the government spending .
This situation is compounded by the fact that , the men are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage .
This situation is well known , so that specific statistics are here .
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other , in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country .
In other words : governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital .
This is particularly in changes to existing laws .
The aim of these measures is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital , particularly in the field of wages .
This is done through economic coercion in long-term unemployment , on the other hand , by the rights of workers .
The result is growing poverty , as well as widening disparities between rich and poor .
In Germany , there are for several years , public food distribution for the poor , who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work .
The number of people who are already in the millions .
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases where workers receive such low wages that the state must increase their income to the subsistence level .
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of the German Bundestag auxiliary staff employed in the .
The austerity measures of practically all eu southern states will be on the same condition in which people are forced to emigrate , under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels ( as in the 19th century ) , or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society , and to hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country .
Here is the question of where this capital ?
If it comes from another EU country , only the poverty from one country to another ; or the capital remains the same , because in China , India , Brazil , Turkey , Morocco or Egypt , or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the European wages .
This applies to all of Latin America .
Liberal theories and media ad nauseam , that the state should not be capital in its own economy , and that a planned economy will lead to economic disaster .
The private capital is on his position that the state should not interfere with in the economy .
Then you have to wonder whether or not the private capital , the policy , and the entire state in its own selfish sense or even .
Here is the clear answer : yes .
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states .
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption , mutual unmistakably , practically everything in the legislation , but nothing is punishable by law .
In Germany , the situation is such that a State Department for lack of finance private , dense with industry of with the development of law .
This legislation is passed in the Bundestag .
All the violence is no longer from the people , as the western nations , but by strong financial groups , who prefer their own interests .
Obviously , the liberal democracies have been in a situation that the Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and ' : `` the state has long been in decay , and the offices were occupied by force .
Against bribes , illegal bequiles of benefits or with stone and sword .
Corruption has grown , and the people with already bought votes went to the polls ... `` '' people with character not applied for as a result of this decline for eight months , so that the state had no consul ... `` '' you really began to talk about it , that is the only medicine an autocracy in this difficult situation , and that a strong man ... `` Appian thought to be elected , but the strong man was , democracy permanently replaced by the .
As it turns out , today 's society is based , as well as in ancient times to the ruthless preference of one 's own advantage , not paying attention to the interests .
Private capital is by its very nature , not in a position to see the advantage for the whole of society .
The result , now as then , is an unprecedented decadence of the elites , who are , not in the slightest for deeper reforms .
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism , therefore , we must in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries .
The current state of affairs , the of these regimes can be seen as a certain pause in favor of liberal democracies , in the next round .
The is the fact that today 's elites in future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives , the humanitarian and social disasters , we have today , as well as the crimes against humanity , as we know it from the older and more recent history , in complete ignorance .
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution , at least not lasting .
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition , the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the level of social security of the population .
This trend is therefore systemic .
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy , increase the influence of the citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital in the company in favour of the state .

Šimon Ornest : on our concerts , we want to collect positive energy gain
What do you think about it , that is to take place in less than a month of the world ?
This is one of those , which we humans are so keen to start .
With our band the Tap Tap we are more fun and say that we are the only band in the world , which can collect enough positive energy in order to stop or prevent the end of the world .
In December , you also have a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world .
Can you imagine the project to our readers ?
It is a national fundraising event , which we have been planning two years ago .
To this end , we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar , which is projected for 21 December at 11 : 10 am in the end of the .
The day before , that is , on 20 December , from 21 : 00 at the same time , three concerts in Prague , Brno and Ostrava .
The end of the concerts will be at the time , on the Pacific island of Kiribati , which is located in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us , the Mayan calendar ends .
Who is from this idea ?
Originally from me , then we have developed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta .
In doing so , we would not only to collect enough positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world , but we also want to consider , together with the public about the state of the world to our children .
At the end of the Mayan calendar , we have a unique collection of shoes , T-shirts , bags and key supporters of the world , with its purchase of can also support the people .
The band the Tap Tap has , together with other performers , the so-called anthem against the world , with the title `` of the world . ''
The anthem is very popular on YouTube . It will resound to the charity concerts ?
Of course , in the end , provided that everything works and the end Of the world does not take place .
The anthem should be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time .
In addition , the anthems are in a direct circuit broadcast live by Czech television .
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák , who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip , also Xindl X sings with ...
How did you come to work with both ?
We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene , which is to the fact that We realize many charity events and concerts .
We are trying to integrate these people in our projects .
It has shown that most people are interested in cooperating with us , and enjoy it .
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts at the end of the world ?
For the establishment of the education center Studeo , in which we are already six years with the club in the Jedlička Institute .
The students of The Jedlička Institute are cared for by editors who help them with different leisure activities .
As the students themselves do not have the resources to go to the editors , we want to help them in this way .
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute is intended to create a separate building in which we with this project .
At every concert , several groups and performers .
What criteria do you have chosen ?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations , including children .
In Prague , for example , support Lesbiens , Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta , The Tap Tap , Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý .
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz .
Similar `` big events '' are planned for the future ?
In May , we are for the first time at the Prague Spring , and for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests .
We also want to be like Next year in the Czech House in New York , and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago .
Their overseas plans are not small , so far , you are already in Madrid , Brussels , London or in Moscow .
The Tap Tap , however , is a group composed of people with disabilities .
How do you manage these journeys logistical and organisational ?
It is not as bad as it seems at first sight .
Five of our members are wheelchair users , i.e . the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment . We must also , of course , many instruments suitcase and other luggage ...
Nevertheless , it has always worked without any problems , SA and British Airways were always been very well prepared for us , that I have been surprised sometimes .
Even in Moscow , where we were recently , there were no problems .
By your foreign travel you have a settlement in the various countries with accessibility , as there are people with disabilities , etc .
How have you seen these things so far ?
After Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other cities where everything works better than ours , we were in Russia , that is still in its early days in the East .
In Prague , Moscow is not totally disabled , it is still unusual , if someone is in a wheelchair in the city centre .
It is not obvious that It is in a wheelchair user , for example , of course , in the elevator .
Fortunately , there are clubs try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities .
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries ?
There are still many things on which we are ...
It should be noted , however , that an improvement in the situation also depends on the efforts of those concerned .
In London and Madrid , it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities independently in the public space , go to the museum , you can use toilets etc .
But it is not usual for a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social activities , we are with the band the Tap Tap the West a little ahead .
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing , but it is only one of our ranks meaning athletes , artists , actors , politicians or lawyers , things will really begin to change .
So far , these are only isolated cases of particularly determined personalities .
The Tap Tap is currently very popular , but if we go back a few years : what motivated in 1998 to create a band ?
I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute , where I met many young people , who were interested in dealing with .
And since I am a musician And saxophone playing , among other things , along with a colleague , I have a music AG .
Oh , and at the time , as our , Láa Angelovi , likes to say , a little out of control ( laughs ) .
The band became known , but only in the last few years , I am wrong ?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us , and we have also started to advertise for us .
We are aware that if you are and that it is not to the outside world , its own performance in a certain sense , does not exist .
Thanks to EU funding , we can also be good editors , and quality equipment and the like .
Was it your goal to get there with The Tap Tap so far ?
From the beginning I felt the potential that we can do things differently .
In the show business often copied to the other .
This is logical in its own way , as new with caution and will be accepted only after a long time .
There are few truly unique things , and I dare say that Tap Tap .
The first impression that The audience is , of course , it is only natural .
But this compassion is absolutely useless , because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned nature , we would have to regret .
There are people who live a full life and can develop , they have the necessary resources .
I always say that if people with disabilities can do something , not just for them , it is a step forward , but for the whole of society .
It was also helpful for this success , that you are a tough boss , as we hear from many people ?
If you want to make something good , there is no compromises on many things , and also need to a certain discipline .
But I think this is completely normal .
Some people come to us with romantic ideas , and if they that they have twice a week , prepared phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours , the enthusiasm quickly extinguished .
How it works everywhere , in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something .
Currently , The Tap Tap twenty members .
How many of them were from the outset , i.e . since 1998 ?
Only one : Láďa Angelovič .
We are an open group . People come and go , That you can prevent .
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join , is always welcome .
Takes place the day before the end of the world , predicted Thursday on the 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m .
Venues are : Incheba Arena / Prague , Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava ; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are at the end , and it sounds a common interpretation of the anthem `` of the world , '' the Tap Tap .
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of a multifunctional accessible education center that under the name STUDEO in Jedlička Institute in Prague . The price : CZK 25 million .
The entry costs 400 CZK , children up to 12 years free tickets are available in advance .

Prostate cancer screening : the test should be made or not ?
The test , in fact , sometimes incorrect results , with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures .
This leads to a greater reluctance of men already undecided for the implementation of screening tests .
The test should be made or not ?
We have the opinion of two doctors .
In the studies conducted in the United States were numerous disturbances between the control groups , so that it is difficult to interpret the data and to give clear recommendations .
Another study , this time from Europe , came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection .
This study has also shown that a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years , the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30 to 40 % higher if no screening was carried out .
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago , when you have a direct relatives , who was already ill with prostate cancer .
There is also a higher risk For men African-American origin .
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer was identified .
There are cancers that , the aggressive and others , they are indolent .
The patients must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer by pointed out the possible options , which can remain untreated prostate cancer , if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term , and will be in this case for an active surveillance of the disease .
Today , many of the men , in which the cancer detected no treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives .
It is an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment .
With increasing accuracy , the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and those who do not .
I therefore recommend that the implementation of the tests .
The most important thing is to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be done or not .
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test .
This document ( currently only available in English , but a translation will be available soon ) can be downloaded at the following address : http : / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens Health / prostate-cancer-screening
To prevent the disease
Unfortunately , there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer .
Despite the progress in the research , the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it .
It is estimated that 30 % of cancers could be prevented if everyone eating well and would move enough .
`` If there is no more smoking , this would rise at least to 50 % , '' says André Beaulieu , a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society .
However , it is estimated that about 10 % of all cancers are caused by inheritance .
Several remain completely unknown .
For the Canadian Cancer Society , the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority , despite the drop in the number of smokers .
Smoking is responsible for 85 % of cases of lung cancer .
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer .
It greatly damages the health of the people .
`` Today , there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec , '' the spokesman André Beaulieu .
Encouraging data : 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette , reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half .
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease .
They seem to have the risk of breast , colon , rectal , , , and cervical cancer .
`` The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer during the entire life , '' he adds .
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat .
In , it increases the risk of a Grimm or rectal cancer .
Sausages should be avoided .
The preservation of meat by smoking , or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens .
`` The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer , '' he says .
Vitamins
In recent years , several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer .
At present , but Their investigations are not conclusive .
According to the Canadian Cancer Society , the studies on vitamin E contradictory .
While a study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer , another showed an increase .
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also has not yet clear .
In addition , Mr Beaulieu , how important it is to talk with his doctor about his concerns and his family history .
`` The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer . ''

The film Argo : if it is The worst , Hollywood call
In November 1979 , a mob demonstrating occupied Islamist students of the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage .
They called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , who had fled for their release after the revolution in the United States , which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime .
For the American government , there has been no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the Shah , as this would have damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries .
At the same time , it was not in a position in Iran , where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages .
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States , and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt by of the hostages made matters worse .
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days , after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government .
The fate of the hostages at home , a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments .
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980 .
The film by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story , which the United States of a small part of victory .
Just before the occupation of the embassy six embassy staff .
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador .
The CIA , in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran , helped them an extravagant story its true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film , which allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film .
The combination of genres
, `` Tony Mendez , developed by the experts for '' Exfiltration plan also made Hollywood 's cooperation .
The camouflage was credible , published articles about on this film project in journals , press conferences were held , and the fictional production company had a real office .
The details of the operation were long kept secret . The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez .
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres .
On the one hand , it is a realistic political thriller , but also a so-called `` Caper Movie , '' the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean 's Eleven .
This change in the film , the Stimmungs levels - on the one hand , the documentary scenes from Tehran ( in the title sequence showing iconic contemporary photographs , and also in the film version of the same situations , there are no major differences ) .
On the other hand , the loose passages from Hollywood , therefore , the ironic and slightly exaggerate .
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the table , at the , on the phone ...
Ben Affleck is a remarkable restarting his career with this film .
From a spokesmen ridiculed actor has become a respected director , and also as an actor , he is no longer the goal of ironic comments .
Argo is his third feature film , the thriller No ( Gone Baby Gone , 2007 ) and the thriller city without mercy ( 2010 ) .
At the same time , it is Afflecks first film , which is not in Boston by the director .
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the previous films from the director of the Hollywood standard .
Affleck is this sense , but also in Argo , where Tehran of Canada `` played . ''
The best scenes of the film in the streets and the reconstruction of events that have taken place - the sequence of the storming of the embassy in its clarity is very impressive , and yet conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when the story .
A similar effect Affleck and his team also fictional scenes ( the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran ) .
Too much action in Too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer many exciting scenes in cinematic terms .
But it has been working With the little , and sometimes he nachhilft reality - which is not always so elegantly ( the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America , or the chase on the runway , some of the ) .
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution , which is due to the need to show too much to act in too many places .
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees , their characters but deserved more space , and that they are not in the film by far from alone .
Afflecks film it loses a little traction . It is a movie that , with some interest and the design and to a thriller from the age of 70 , retro style .
Enthusiasm , however , it is difficult .
As a reminder of a living piece of history , in some way , and as evidence of how the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services , but it is enough .

In a constantly elektrisierten world , it is nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving , I spent five hours in the airport , as our plane unexpectedly due to mechanical problems , and we had to wait for another plane .
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts on boredom .
I do not want to lie .
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight to , is pretty annoying - even when books , magazines and iPhones ( and , of course , tax-free shopping ) are available .
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive .
If it goes to them , it is for us - and our children - okay , sometimes bored .
So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts , which promotes creativity .
And because most of us , almost constantly on a screen or , we do not get the benefits of boredom .
We should welcome the boredom with open arms ?
Yes .
And no .
I will come back again .
Like many people , I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon , which has developed with increasing leisure time .
But Peter Toohey , professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of `` Boredom : A Lively history '' ( Yale University Press , 2011 ) is not the case .
`` In fact , the boredom is a very long history , '' he says .
The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom , which dates back to the first century .
And then there is the question of how we define boredom .
John D. Eastwood , an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario , Canada , the problem is that boredom in many ways been defined and discussed .
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience , `` a satisfactory job to do , but not to be able to define . ''
Boredom is different from apathy , in such a way that the person is not , but it would be .
The apathy , however , there is no urge to do something .
The key experience of boredom , he says , is in a `` disruption of the process , coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly . ''
Boredom can listen almost like depression .
But Professor Eastwood believes that although , even though these two conditions , could be bored people see the problem in their area or the world , while depressed people see the problem in itself .
Sometimes , we believe that it is boring , even if we only have to concentrate .
In their study , `` the Unengaged mind : Defining boredom in terms of attention '' - for example : `` the idle mind : the definition of boredom in terms of attention , '' which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues in an earlier experiment , in which participants listened to a band , in which a person read a magazine article .
Some groups have heard a loud tv program from the neighbouring area , which had nothing to do with the content . Others heard it on low volume , so that it was barely perceptible , while the third group not heard these sounds at all .
The people who heard the barely audible television , said to have more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus , could find no reason for and wrote their difficulties of boredom .
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task , the disruption of the attention can lead to boredom , says Mark J. Fenske , associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study .
If you put a monotonous work , `` as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt , can distract music and help to not feel bored . ''
In fact , he says , we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln , often interpreted as a sign of boredom , even by people who are physically attentive .
`` Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still , '' says Professor Fenske .
All of us will be boring - my late flight , a dröhnender speakers , a particularly tedious film .
But some people get bored more easily than others .
In order to measure these differences , researchers have developed a `` scale in the 1980s , to boredom vulnerability . ''
On the scale there are statements such as `` many things that I have to do to repeat and monotonous '' and `` I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything . ''
With the help of such scales researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls , Stephen Vodanovich , a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly on , with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli .
But in general , teenagers are a pretty abgespannter clusters .
In the year 1991 , Reed Larson , a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois , an experiment In which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager .
He found that 32 % of adolescents in school and the were bored , while 23 % said to be bored , if they were not in school .
But only 3 % of parents said to feel bored .
Professor Larson says today , 21 years later , he does not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom .
But he was sure that `` youth is seen as a particularly boring , '' mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine .
So back to my original question : boredom is healthy ?
Sometimes , as in extreme cases , it does not mean that people take extreme physical risks and gambling or drugs to , in order to relieve - studies have shown .
On the other hand , many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity . This view is professor Vodanovich , who researched the subject for more than two decades .
`` With the boredom , the brain wants to say that we should do something else , '' said Gary Marcus , a professor of psychology at the University of New York .
But the brain does not always know what you should do it best .
If it is boring and you use the energy to play guitar and to cook , you will be happy .
But television can in the short term for happiness , these evaporate But in the long term .
Anyone who is his bored child an iPad , it can distract from the boredom , but it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control , says Professor Fenske .
And he adds : `` self-control is transferred from one situation to another . ''
The child learns not only to entertain , but also in other areas more self-control .
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom .
We should also do not see it .
Instead , our aim should be to feel at home , away from the constant activity and technology .
Professor Eastwood agrees .
`` It sounds as if we would have to be more boring , but boredom is the nagging , relentless desire to do something meaningful , '' he says .
He believes that people in truth only looking for a way to switch off and relax .
`` In an environment in which we are constantly , it is hard to look , when the noise is silent . ''

A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi .
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration , which he temporarily divided the unlimited power of more than ever , he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket .
To the surprise of all , he has announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly on its final version , the next day .
Just a week ago , the head of state had granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work to the House .
Egypt is based now for almost two years on a temporary , repeatedly amended text , which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess .
This new initiative has a for an even stronger division of the country .
For his opponents , the president in his `` autocratic delirium '' is `` by breaking his word '' and `` the right underfoot . ''
On the side of his supporters are assured that it is a way , the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process .
A referendum should be held within 14 days .
A very short period of time , which is forcing the brothers to give up their project , the Egyptians to explain the text section for section .
For the president , it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy , while the protest raging across the country .
In an interview with the American Wochenschau Time seems to have to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably .
Given that the Egyptian people with this to a hasty vote an ultimatum : `` Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power of attorney , '' the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution is supposed to end .
85 mostly Islamist members of the constituent assembly approved the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere .
The majority of the has not complied with the request .
On the eve of the constitutional declaration in mid-November , they have , because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views .
Representatives from human rights organisations , religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly .
To achieve the quorum yesterday morning , 11 people in a hurry , deputy members added .
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers .
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously .
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day ... the time has come for the prayer , because some members of the panel were of the opinion that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly was not .
The text , which was last night , consists of 234 articles .
Article 2 , which drew all the attention , after all , identical to that of the 1971 constitution states that `` the principles of sharia are the main source of law . ''
The salafi parties , for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand , had hoped , `` the principles '' by `` the rules , '' which would have made a stricter application .
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not changed , a proof of their good will and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society .
`` Hypocrisy '' of the liberals , who see it as propaganda .
According to the Islamisation of the Constitution on other items .
They are particularly Article 220 in the eye of the Al-Azhar University , which awards an advisory role , particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of Sharia law .
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier , this is worrying , because `` the people who are being asked to , have not been elected and has no democratic legitimacy .
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. ``
The fears of the Liberals also fed by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one .
`` There is currently no specific religious commitment .
With this Constitution , we remain within the framework of the civil state .
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text , there are no Ulema , but academics , who have been trained in the French system , `` appeased Alexis Blouet , who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition .
But he admits that `` in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity may be , because the terms of the religious vocabulary .
It is in particular to the `` fiqh '' [ Islamic jurisprudence Red . ] .
And in the future could be raised the question of civilian judges are competent to decide. ``
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday sharply because of the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic .
The Muslim Brotherhood , argue that these are significantly reduced compared with the former regime .
Another point of contention : the powers of the army .
In accordance with the wishes of the military , the examination of the defense budget will be submitted to Parliament , but a national defence council .
There will be no ban on civil trial in military courts , as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights .
The latter also share their concerns with regard to the text , which they see as threatening freedom .
The offence of blasphemy , and insults are now banned , which could have serious implications for the right to freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
In addition , no article refers to the protection of women , underscores Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch .
They say that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36 .
This word was not included in the previous constitution .
While the Egyptian president last night had to say on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
Proponents of the head of state will march Saturday .

Chief : control of the black system failed due to the fault of politics
The Czech Republic , in connection with public contracts good bodies and adequate laws , but falls in their application .
In the interview for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the board of control ( Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad , NKÚ ) , Miloslav Kala .
`` A law is never perfect , but it must be applied correctly - and I think that this is not the case , '' said Kala , the current situation .
A similar result is A common control by Czech and German .
He has the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas example As a bad practice , the so-called `` black system . ''
The Prime Minister said Recently that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls , the system is prohibited or allowed ?
`` A law must have valid , and if something is forbidden by law , then the chairman of the government simply can not come , and the control Office , whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law , an obstacle in his work , '' Kala .
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies , you talked about a common Czech-German project , in which the laws of both countries were compared with each other on public contracts .
What did it ?
It is a parallel investigation , with which we started about two years ago .
Simply put , it is important that the European legislature determines how to handle public contracts . The national legislation . And finally , there is the real practical application .
All of this , we have compared with each other , and although the review is not yet complete , we have seen very interesting differences , generally speaking , the laws are perhaps a little `` strict and perfect , but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany .
This confirms that it is not enough to draw up new and more detailed rules . You have to deal with the actual application of the law .
How can you help ? What is for you from this project ?
It is precisely such a joint control could help us that we stop a perfecting of laws and the reduction and balance thresholds , if this does not seem particularly positive .
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price ( which is not always the lowest price ) to buy and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts .
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal .
It may even be the case that the system in this way only with excessive paperwork `` , '' and those who are looking for loopholes in the system , it is much easier to exploit the system , as if the threshold were higher .
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law .
How does the control system in Germany ?
Is there a similar authority as our NKÚ , or the system works differently ?
As far as the authorities , the German equivalent to the NKÚ the Federal Court of Auditors , which is similar to us , and also has a college , which is only slightly different . In principle , but authorities both the same .
The skills are comparable to a certain extent , with Germany , however , a federal state , which means that there is this in the individual states - in the German system is different from ours .
The BRH can only control federal funds , which is in our state funds .
Public funds are managed by the districts and municipalities , are subject to the control of the courts .
As far As the German legislation is easier than ours ?
In general , I would compare this reluctant without specific details . However , in some ways , Germany is often described as a model , but you can not say that Germany in particular is better .
That is because the auditors are better ?
That is not , but as I do n't particularly like , such comparisons .
It should be noted that even those countries which are a model for us , also have to contend with problems .
Otherwise , they would have nothing to work with our authority , Or ?
With regard to the Czech legislation , the importance of your authority , the revision of the law you feel any impact ?
Given that this is only a short time in power , it is not yet in our tests so far .
After the our controls , you have to rely on a certain delay .
We feel so far in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument `` detection of risks of inefficiency '' and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed , the changes will have an impact , of course , because the threshold values change , the conditions have been modified for certain types of of .
You can see the adoption of this law is more positive , or the system will be charged with more bureaucracy ?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed .
It may occur , however , the problem is that the rules will be `` tougher '' and can no longer be met .
Under the previous rules are , in a way to the winner ( for example , in the event of an operational programme of regional policy , the regional council ) accountable that any breach of the law is a violation of budgetary discipline .
But it is to make the law more stringent ?
I do not believe that in this way .
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system , and not to punish those who have , which made a formal does not affect the actual decision-making .
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure .
Where is the solution ?
We say first of all , what is not .
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with control of the so-called `` black system '' - what does that mean exactly ?
The system is now banned or allowed ?
A law must have valid , and if something is forbidden by law , then the chairman of the government simply can not come , and the control Office , whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law , an obstacle in his work .
He can say : `` we change the law and allow the thing , '' but He can not say that we do so , as if nothing would be .
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain events - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition .
On the other hand , it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer will be excluded because of procedural .
The law will never be perfect , but it must be applied right - and that is what is missing in my opinion .

Israel : laboratory of chaos .
`` ... nothing comes from violence , or ever could , '' sings the Sting song fragile , whose main verse in the refrain is : `` ... so that we do not forget how fragile we are . ''
`` When my sons no wars , there would be no , '' says the dying Gutele Schnaper , wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild , in the year 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip , as always , a host of reactions .
There are those who stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense , while the Palestinians call them as terrorists ; the others support the Palestinians , arguing with the racism of the state of Israel , with the genocide perpetrated in the Palestinian Arabs and the state of Israel as a terrorist .
At this point I would like to write about who is in these recurring waves of killing someone who is guilty and who have not been At the end of the people of Israel , including the areas in the current political situation , and have not seen the start of the violence .
It is the of the readers behind the scenes of the 95 years of tension ( from the Balfour declaration in November 1917 ) in small parcels of land in the Middle East in particular is to who .
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts , others are derived from them and from out of my own understanding of who or what group of people affected by the events of modern history .
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power .
In every era , we can make a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon .
What is less obvious is the question of whether it really were themselves , independently of their steps , or whether someone was behind her throne , who drew their actions on a goal .
We must admit that we live in an era in which the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of money and the resulting power is not within the life span of a generation .
Among these astronomical rich families particularly stands out , which could be described as head of the octopus ( I do not know if someone above them , but I do not rule this out ) - the Rothschilds .
Not much is written about them .
It is understandable .
The first press agency ( Reuters ) was the Rothschilds in the 1990s , in order to prevent the combination of its name with in the context of the consolidation of its power , the propagation of their assets , or both .
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world , and the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks , they lead wars or these ( before the attack on Afghanistan , there were 7 countries , after the attack on Iraq , there were five countries , after the fall Ghaddafis remained only four , with in the meantime , the central bank of the of Russia 's government has ) .
Anyone who has tried to counter this family had to pay with their lives .
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds , bank of America as the central bank began during the civil war , their own ( read : state ) notes and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater .
J.F . Kennedy began their own notes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve , he was assassinated in 1963 ; the Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 , after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929 .
The global appetite for power of the Rothschilds , in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to free up three world wars by Albert Pik , a of the and the highest degree of knowledge .
The first war was aimed at eliminating the big royalist states to the second war , in particular , the British colonial rule should be broken , and the third war is to reduce the world 's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people ( such a number would provide for their amenities and its luxury and would not consume so many resources ) , create a universal religion ( the ecumenism is nothing more than the apron ) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power .
The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the head , triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution ( order chao - order out of chaos .
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation ( see the creation of the Federal Reserve , so that crises such as the them in the year 1907 do not repeat ) .
After they were by the murder of the Hapsburg heir to the throne , Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed to trigger the First World War , they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolshevik revolution .
The First World war ended with the sudden , militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany ( for the destruction of the Russian empire , the war was not necessary ) , then the dissolution of the Central European power .
In order to be able to the Second World war , the bankers by the policy a latent conflict situation by Germany with huge war reparations , they created the precondition of impoverished masses , so they had to keep palming the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who offered the culprits , and simple solutions ; another factor was the creation of the state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority , which should be the function of a fifth column , and also in order to of war .
At the end of the 19th century , the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement , in which a branch of the establishment of a Jewish state , with Jerusalem as its capital , as the historic area ( return to Zion ) .
The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine ; it was the first clashes with the local Arab population .
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides .
The Second World War broke out , and whether Hitler , the chain , which it initially had kept the international bankers , or whether everything went according to plan , it is difficult to assess , in any case , the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the World community .
Israel was founded in 1948 , and was , as well as by the War reparations against Germany , preparing the ground for the Second World War II , the creation of the state of Israel , the creation of the focal point for the Third World War .
If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war , is similar to the Jewish people World war II to the victims in the front line of battle , this time , along with the Arab and Muslim population in the of the Middle East .
Israel is like a giant laboratory , a source of conflict and the chaos , not only in the country itself , but also internationally ( just think of how sharply divided the people of supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
Who is guilty and who was the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites , where injustice is only in an endless spiral of violence , as at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their quest for global power ?
It is important to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders , but the international bankers in Israel as well as for us , the people , only their own candidates for election .
The current Prime Minister of Israel , Netanyahu , the , is a typical example of a , international bankers loyal dedicated politician who does everything to spark a war with Iran , which , in the face of Iran 's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan ... ) , could come into a global conflict , and that , because of the Iran 's control over only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz , through which 20 % of global oil supplies could lead to the deterioration of the world economy .
In the light of the words of David Rockefellers from 1994 : `` the only thing we need is an across-the-board crisis , and the people will welcome the new world order . ''
In its presentation , the new world order is a world of masters and slaves .
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats .
A world in which every newborn baby at the birth of a chip implanted , in order to the essence of total control .
`` And it is that the kids and the Great , the rich and the poor , the Free and the servants , a all to their right hand or on their forehead , that no one can buy or sell , because the malt , the name of the animal or the number of his name .
Here is wisdom , who is , who consider the number of the animal .
Because it is a human figure , and his number is six hundred sixty-six. ``

With Bitcoin payments and selling without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks , identified transactions and processing fees between the parties .
In addition , as so often in these technologies , a political vision tangible : the conviction that the current monetary system , from bank , leads to financial crises .
In fact , by Satoshi Nakamoto ( a pseudonym ) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency ( but in dollars , euros , etc . ) as well as convertible , a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent , which allows the direct exchange of files .
With 15,000 computers in the network has already been about 200,000 transactions .
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or payment .
After the price of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) had reached five months later , he fell to 2 dollars , before he recovered to about ten dollars ( the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com ) .
Nothing particularly Beeindruckendes compared to the global trade of real currency or financial products .
However , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest .
It describes Bitcoin as `` the virtual currency with the greatest success , '' `` in competition with the dollar or euro '' and `` similar to the conventional currencies . ''
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the `` , '' which are used to make progress in a video game by winning games or buy ( and sometimes ) .
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system .
However , the trade is controlled and managed by a central authority .
With Bitcoin are all at the same time , money network nodes repositories of the accounting book , auditors , and buyers and sellers .
How does this network ?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail .
With the difference that the user for each payment can choose a different address , which ensures the anonymity .
A number of the data associated with this transaction will be electronically signed by a double encryption system .
In this way , the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction .
With the help of the content of the file is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the accounting book in the entire network of public accounts are available .
The crucial step is to sign this new deal in this book .
This is a mathematical task , which will be launched on the computers , with the winner , who is a kind of provisional central banker , has the privilege to add This additional line .
It is a carving up the file , i.e. , the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint .
The computer , `` '' the new transaction and add a number of before the whole thing `` . ''
The goal is to find the that number , which is a special fingerprint ( many zeros at the beginning ) .
If this number has been found , the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one .
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions , and any modification would change the fingerprint .
If a user wants to very fast ( less than 10 minutes ) with the same money to pay for only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without a link , since both have different fingerprints .
The computer , which has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins .
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly , probably before the end of 2012 .
The Bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million , but up to one hundred millionth divisible , which leaves some room for manoeuvre ... .
In addition , the difficulty of the task with any improvement in the computing power .
The life of the network has already had ups and downs .
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin , were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits .
`` The weakness is not the , '' Pierre Noizat , who has just introduced Paymium , which is a company to pay with real money , and the network Bitcoin .
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering by means of this anonymous service .
But also cash these shortcomings .
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind .
Others , such as the blog platform WordPress , they will be accepted .
Recently , Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel , the accounting book and showed that almost 80 % of Bitcoins in circulation .
In November , a `` '' was launched .
`` Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged , '' Jon Holmquist , who works for the company Coin Abul , Bitcoins converted into gold .
Pierre Noizat , who is also the author of a book about this currency , firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network .
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card ( real money ) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone , but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions , which are cheaper .
In addition , the owner managed its identity and can remain anonymous .
The system can be easily implemented with them , and the latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs .
They simply need to an address , photographed and identified by a telephone `` can be , '' Pierre Noizat , who assured us that he has thousands of users .
It is a general trend in the hierarchical systems for in favour of more horizontally oriented systems .
`` It will take some time to Bitcoin , but 2013 could be a turning point , '' he predicted .
The ECB sees in her report , by the way today as a highly regarded risks in the event of a success of this currency .

The conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Declaration of Lima
The sixth summit of the president of the Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration , which was announced previously and , in theory , , should be signed by the seven attending leaders .
Efe tried repeatedly to gain access to the document signed at the sixth ordinary session of the Heads of state and government of the Unasur . Sources in the state and presidential office initially said that they would pass the exam , however , then declared that it would be some time on the website of the Peruvian government .
If you have any questions on the text said , that the content of the president of Peru , Ollanta Humala , set out in brief statements to the press .
The journalists ' access to information about the summit was limited at any time .
During the day was in the press room only the image of the President meeting without tone with the message `` private meeting , limited audio . ''
The few information floating around among the journalists , the press spokespeople of some of the governments present at the meeting of the Unasur , but not from the Peruvian press spokesman .
The only document that was during the day , the list of participating in the , which caused hundreds of journalists from different national and international media , calling for more information .
The president of Peru sent an email with the `` final statement '' of the summit on the media , but the statement by Humala , and After that , not the official document at the end of the summit .
Last October , Peru was the host of the summit South America - Arab states ( ASPA ) , and on this occasion , despite serious concern by the press , the so-called Declaration of Lima , which had been previously announced , .
On the official website of the ASPA can see that the document was published On Tuesday .
On both international meeting stressed the Peruvian authorities , that the information systems for journalists , but they were limited to a large extent , the access to information .
The summit also ended with the shared commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Court of Justice in the Hague , which settles a border dispute between the two countries .
The president of Peru , Ollanta Humala , and Chile , Sebastián Piñera , met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ , which begins on Monday in the Hague , in the process , the Lima against Santiago , listen to the pleas of both sides .
`` We will be the verdict on the differences that we are at the moment , and this International Court of Justice follow , '' said Humala , along with his Chilean counterpart .
`` It was , is and remains a country that complies with international laws , for peaceful solutions to disputes , agreements and to the international courts , '' adds Piñera and gave Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries .
The confirmation of both presidents that they would be subject to the ICJ , came after Colombia for a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua , which was a serious mistake , lodged a complaint against the agreement , which agreed to submit to the rulings of the of the International Court of Justice .
At the summit were the presidents of Brazil , Dilma Rouseff , of Venezuela , Hugo Chávez , of Bolivia , Evo Morales , and of Argentina , Cristina Kirchner .
Since 2011 , the of its president Fernando Lugo of Paraguay , which is excluded from the Unasur , did not participate in the meeting .
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after midday in Lima .
The head of state read the final document , which he announced that 16 decisions and the guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries on an with a total of investment amount of $ 17 billion .
The decisions , he said that the countries of the Unasur `` significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship , which we extend the decisions on residency rights . ''
He said that measures to improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and against organized , transnational crime , as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and in the event of natural disasters to act jointly and effectively. ``
With the crisis in Europe , `` the economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) , but is designed to expand our production capacity and a better future for our peoples , '' Humala said .
`` We have decided to give a series of 31 flagship projects , which are intended to improve the spatial relationships in South America , especially in rural and border areas ... and thus uniting our countries and new forms of economic , '' said the Peruvian president in a statement read .
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian who are on the horizontal axis of his area from the coast to Brazil , and two of which would be for a better connection with Ecuador , although he gave no further details .
Similarly , the final document referred to the political situation in Paraguay .
`` We hope that the electoral process in this country for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations , '' from which it is currently excluded .
The need for Latin America continues to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations , was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit .
In this sense , the president of Colombia , Juan Manuel Santos said before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that he is expected on Saturday in Mexico in a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , to treat the maritime dispute after a Bogotá in question judgment of the ICJ , respectfully .
`` Maybe I will meet tomorrow ( Saturday ) with President Daniel Ortega , '' said Santos .
`` We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive , and also the agreement with Nicaragua necessary talks with Nicaragua , '' he said .
`` I hope to be able to say to the President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible , '' Santos added .
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they have the intention to be present at the inauguration of the new president of this country , Enrique Peña Nieto .
As part of the summit also in the run-up to the defence ministers of the block the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013 , which is intended to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on the defense of the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Guyana , Surinam and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR , even if the latter is currently at the country .
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc .

Daily drink butter - and 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan , many people reach a biblical great age .
There is even a museum for longevity .
A search in the country where 97-year old are still relatively young .
In the south of Azerbaijan , many people reach a biblical great age .
There is even a museum for longevity .
A search in the country where 97-year old are still relatively young .
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic .
The minibus rumpelt on the winding road , past densely wooded hills , rushing rivers and simple farmhouses .
Everything is green and juicy , you might think , would be in the Black Forest .
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan , the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away .
The Caucasian ethnic group of the , which is not much known , except that it perfectly and Azeri speaks and is very durable .
Last stop is Lerik .
The small town of flaunts to architecture from Soviet times , which does not want in the picturesque mountain scenery .
Tourists from Europe did not come here is too onerous , the from Azerbaijan 's capital Baku .
For the 323 miles you need eight hours , because the road is only one .
The fabulous wealth of the country 's oil in the Caspian Sea , has not yet arrived here in the province .
But Pilata Fatulayeva ( 48 ) is convinced that Lerik what it takes to be a tourist attraction .
`` Baku in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world , '' says Fatulayeva .
She is the director of the museum of longevity , the only one in the world .
The is documented in the area of about eight dozen Talyschen older than 100 . Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo .
This is my grandfather , he was 120 years old .
At the age of 136 years of a child
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov , which is expected to be 168 years old .
A birth certificate , but does not exist .
And in view of the oldest documented man , who was 122 years old , Müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful .
`` He was born in 1805 in the region , he died in 1973 , '' explains Fatulayeva .
The man was married three times and had 23 children , at the age of 136 he is still a daughter .
It Has Şirali Müslümov at his age for a couple of decades ?
But Rembrandt Scholz , age , researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock , has heard from the very elderly - in Central Asia .
`` A striking number of hochaltrige people is also available in some parts of China , Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan , '' says Scholz , `` live in Sardinia , huge numbers of very old men . ''
However , due to the lack of documents is no scientific proof of age , especially .
Every day becherweise melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik remarkably often a biblical age .
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years .
So why live in the south so many people ?
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains with the particular genes of Talyschen .
Museum director Fatulayeva , in contrast , believes that it is a matter of the other .
But that the high-calorie diet of Talyschen should be healthy meat , bread and milk products , in particular , love , and many of those daily drink a glass of melted butter , from a point of view does not seem plausible .
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young ? In Cengemiran , a tiny village near the town of Lerik , Rubaba Mirzayeva .
With its 97 years for this , it is still relatively young .
Mirzayeva , which claims to have 143 descendants , lives in a simple wooden house , which is typical for the whole of the entire Caucasus region .
It is sitting on the floor with a butter barrel they tirelessly and herrollt .
Eight people live under one roof , including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter , both are grandparents .
Two small children .
In the kitchen preparing tea , which is served in the typical , bauchförmigen Armadu glasses for the guests .
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect , hidden under her headscarf , long , dark blonde braids , her son proudly unveiled in front of us .
I have always washed my hair with milk , they never went out and retained their color .
`` I have never used , '' says Mirzayeva shampoo .
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always eaten what came from their own farm , tomatoes , potatoes , peas .
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food .
It tells of her husband , who was in the army .
It was the worst in the period after the Second World War .
But everything was better than the `` beloved father Heydar Aliyew took over .
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman .
But the cult , which is driven by the father figure of the nation , who ruled his country like a dictator , knows no limits in Azerbaijan .
Until 2003 he was in power , his son Ilham took the helm .
After all , there is no hardship in Azerbaijan .
230 Manat ( about the same amount in euros ) , Mirzayeva per month as a pension , an amount that you can live well for local conditions , it is possible .
And perhaps Mirzayevas has long ergrauter son right : `` The old enjoy respect in our culture . ''
They live in the midst of the extended family , loved , cared for and are happy .
If that is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive

Messenger : NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury .
The ice sheet is to be up to 20 metres thick .
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury .
Although he is closest to the sun , there are also frozen water there , as well as from three studies published on Thursday in the in the journal Science .
The Messenger probe found evidence of the fact that there is an ice in the region of the planet permanently in the shadow .
This is supposed to be at least 30 cm and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick .
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that are on The Mercury .
No one put the discovery of ice , but with the existence of life on the planet , said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe , Sean Solomon .
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius .
However , the findings could help to resolve such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system .
Unnoticed by the world 's citizens are probes , telescopes and small robots like Phoenix to explore the depths of the universe .
From time to time they send images to Earth : small in .
The image comes from a camera , the German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute .
The eight planets in our solar system , The dwarf planet Ceres .
Like Pluto , which revolves around the sun behind Neptune , is not only the international astronomical Union of 2006 , after the new definition of `` planet '' .
This picture of an infrared absorption of the Spitzer telescope shows a `` family portrait '' of countless generations of stars : the oldest stars are as blue dots , more difficult to identify the pink `` newborn '' in the circle .
This region - the scientists unromantic W5 , discovered the Spitzer telescope in the star image Cassiopeia , at a distance of 6500 light-years .
The Spitzer telescope Nasa has This dazzling glow of a dying star .
The ring consists of material that the star in the process of dying .

The recording released by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius .
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus ( divided into three sections , ) , as dark dust streaks the heart of the star .
In the constellation , astronomers have photographed astronomer harbingers of a cosmic collision : 400 million light years from Earth , the cores of two verschmelzender galaxies , and will inevitably collide with each other .
This of the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83 .
Those Who are not technical options , which may call them by their nickname Southern .
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a portion of the iris Nebula in the constellation Kepheus .
The 1400 light years distant fog consists of dust grains , which are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary house dust .
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes .
It shows a ring of black holes , 430 million light-years from earth .
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 , took up the Hubble space telescope for Nasa .
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810 .
This is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way .
The new Youngster .
These stars cloud , coupled with the fog , brings new baby stars - 5000 light years away from earth .
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole , there is no dust , but only gas .
Researchers suspect that he was born just after the Big Bang , when the universe was mostly hydrogen .
Our insights into space : the most important telescopes
The telescope will have been invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei began a year later to star observation .
Since then , the mirror of the optical telescopes ever greater , and the insights they provide deeper and deeper .
For 30 years , from 1947 to 1975 , was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego , the largest telescope in the world .
The mirror , in the picture , had an average of five meters .
In Arizona , USA , is the Large Binocular Telescope .
It can gaze into space on two mirrors , each with a diameter of 8.4 meters .
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror is to 10.4 meters in diameter .
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs .
Nevertheless , it has a diameter of 11 metres .
As part of the : the telescope is in his elevation angle - and thus limited in his mobility .
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle .
Its special feature : the high Lichtsammelkraft .
This is , after all , despite relatively small mirror diameter - in the world 's largest mirror telescopes .
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo ( Puerto Rico ) the for alien signals .
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters .
In the `` search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) can help every computer owner by computing power .
Look at the Observatory of European Observatory ( ESO ) in the Chilean Andes .
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name .
With its four mirrors the telescope can also be the medium-sized infrared spectrum .
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned .
Its main mirror is a whopping 42 metres - and nearly 1000 mirror elements .
But can be expected until 2018 .
2007 the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea was seen as the largest in the world .
They offer two mirrors , each with an average of ten meters .
The Keck telescopes are part of the summit of Mauna Kea Observatory , which is next to them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF into the sky .
Also on the summit of Mauna Kea is intended to create a new giant telescope with a mirror average of thirty meters .
It is an illustration .
The main impressions from space , However , the Hubble space telescope .
Since the April 24 , 1990 , it provides images of distant worlds .
Since March 2009 , the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable .
On 2 February 2011 , was by the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates since the beginning of the mission .
In the picture are the final launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope .
The James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) will be at least until at least 2018 on board a .
The primary mirror of The Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters .
One of the tasks of the telescope : It is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang .
Scientists estimate that at the South Pole ice .
However , there are no reliable data , the Messenger far closer to the North Pole revolves around the planet .
Radar measurements for decades , have pointed out that there is on the ice .
The 2004 launched Messenger probe - the first revolves around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty .

The start of the course , which studied the `` end of the world . ''
Every week , the students apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war , zombies , viruses and germs and global warming .
Each semester , when the religion professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world , he knew that he had an irresistible hook : the end of the `` long reverse counting '' of the Maya calendar on December 21 , which many people believed that it was the end of the world .
But Charmé had no idea what it should be expected in the next two months : the destructive Hurricane Sandy , which some have called `` Deudarmaggedon '' , as well as a growing conflict involving Israel , the place where the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins .
`` I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester , ever , '' said Charmé this week , students at Rutgers University in Camden , New Jersey .
If someone analysed what happened today in the world , as if we were thirty days away , it would be a really good period .
And he is the fact that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality .
And he is not the only professor of this semester , which should be the last in history courses through the end of the world. ``
In Temple , the beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker course `` media , culture and the end of the world . ''
Every week , the students apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war , zombies , viruses and germs and global warming .
`` We will analyze why these ideas spread over time , '' he said , and the way in which offered hypothetical scenarios that lead to a certain human behavior .
If nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out .
This month , the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and studied how they compare in comparison with the real life .
`` I have tried to inform students about what is possible , probably , credible and impossible , '' said Vacker .
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania , the professor of Latin American history , Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari , a professor of art history and anthropology , a team to offer a course with the simple name `` the end of the world . ''
`` We are not taking 2012 to ensure that we retain the option to be able to hold the course , in the event that the world does not go down , '' said Restall .
Despite the `` impending doom '' must study , the students create projects and take part in exams .
In Penn State 's final examination will be carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse , which is why the students have no other option but to continue working `` until the night of the world is supposed to end , '' said Restall .
The courses were very popular .
`` In two hours there were no seats , '' said about his course for students with a high average , filled with 35 students .
For weeks before the start of term we received e-mails from students who asked whether still seats available .
The students , for its part , that the course is one of the most interesting .
`` It is fascinating to see what people do to console themselves , '' said Bridgid Robinson , a 23-year-old student at the age for religion and sociology from Haddonfield , New Jersey .
The apocalyptic sects or religion mentality is really only a matter of comfort or its absence .
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and health care , to all the apocalyptic films .
`` I have never heard of a classroom , where it will be informed , '' he admitted .
I enjoy it .
But none of the surveyed students - and a professor - said to believe in the last date of 21 December .
`` Our first project treated the prophecy of the Maya , and in some ways we discredit them , '' said Julie Zeglen , a student last year in Temple , 21 years old and from West Chester .
The Maya never predicted the end of the world ; it is just a key point in the calendar , said Restall .
However , he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in the Western society , which dates back several centuries ago , when the people on changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world .
The Internet has increased The speculation .
`` The Other people do not think so , '' he says .
This is mainly in the English-speaking world .
Joseph Dougherty , a religion professor at the University of La Salle , which this year in the Philippines , quickly replied to the question of whether he would be a course on the end of the world. ``
`` The Philippines is not at the end of the world , '' he wrote as an exception to a higher authority .
We have a pardon from the Pope .
Restall pointed out that over the years many days from the last court , and said that if on 21 December nothing happens , `` people immediately think of a new date '' or that , the beginning of a seven-year period , which would be the end of the world .
Students and professors take this date easily .
Several said that they want to go to celebrate `` the end of the world . ''
`` Maybe I will call a few friends , so that we can laugh together , '' said Samira Ford , a 20-year-old student for communications .

The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the possible discovery of the has attracted some attention last summer , and for good reason .
It is believed that the boson is nothing less than the mechanism , which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe .
And , finally , it is the last of the standard model particle whose existence - our best or the least wrong `` explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - has been observed , but not predicted by .
But for physicists , it is not completely sure that it really is the Higgs .
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles , and that it is similar to the predicted by the standard model Higgs boson .
In addition , this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto , but there are no data yet to be completely secure .
We assume that it is indeed the Higgs is wrong , because apparently only a small risk to , and let us look at what is at stake .
There is an inevitable law that in this world that can be two objects at the same time , in the same place .
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try not to , because you are hurt .
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world , it turns out that such a law applies to them : the Pauli exclusion principle , which means that two particles can occupy the same space at the same time , if they are in the same quantum state `` , '' and `` on the whole , consists of some of its properties .
The physicists share the particles into two categories .
In one corner are the good citizens , who are referred to as and the Pauli principles .
And in the other the bosons , a nasty bunch of anarchists , whom nothing is sacred , not in any case , this principle , which means that they can indeed be at the same time , at the same place .
These bosons are divided according to the website the Particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab ( which is absolutely amazing ) into two groups : the Mesonen , which we will not deal with here and the `` , '' the great forces of nature and the Higgs boson , which would be .
It must be stressed , however , that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures , such as one might think .
If you are able to read this , then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality : the photon , or light particles , `` the '' messenger `` of the electromagnetic force .
If a particle with an electric charge accelerates or change the direction of , the electromagnetic field is in this place `` disrupted '' like a pebble , which was thrown into a pond .
In this `` disorder '' creates an electromagnetic wave ( light , infrared and ultraviolet radiation , etc . ) , and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons `` of the force . ''
More stable field
The same is true for the Higgs boson , with the difference that another field , must be `` disrupted '' Higgs field , so that the boson .
However , the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field ; the pathogen must achieve very high energies , a bit like having a frozen pond , whose surface could be a very large rocks spall .
That is why a giant particle accelerator is - as CERN 's Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km ! - In order to achieve the kind of energy .
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd .
It is not , in fact , all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field .
Some , like magnets , do this , but not others - for example , a piece of paper would never in the refrigerator .
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field : those who do have a mass , while the other ( such as the photon ) have no mass .
What all this research can be `` good '' , asks Mrs Plamondon ?
For the science they serve the review of the standard model ( SM ) , and they also allow the physicists , all discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the to .
There are many physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found , because the slightest difference to open a door to a `` new physics '' and could fill some holes of the model .
It must be said that the latter still major shortcomings , there is no explanation for the gravity ( ups ! ) and the dark matter , which is about 80 % of the matter in the universe ( again ups ! ) .
However , the CERN such deviations were not found until now .
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no .
By the way : in the early 1960s , the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs that their work would trigger such a revolution .
They saw scientific applications , but nothing else .
In fact , the late physicist Willard Boyle , who has worked in the Bell Labs , where the laser was invented in the 1960s , and even in 1962 , the first ( were the first gepulst ) - has already said that the laser at the beginning , rather than a `` laboratory gimmick '' .
Imagine ...
In addition , there are also from all the instruments that surround the research .
For example , in turn , Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in optics , has developed a small light sensor .
Although it was not the original purpose of the sensor is now all digital cameras worldwide as the `` eye '' and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physics .
Of course , this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives , but it means that you can never really know ...

The cause of death due to AIDS is now too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result : HIV positive .
`` It was as if a bomb hit , '' he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis , the doctor without apparent success `` tried to weaken . ''
He hid it from his family .
He decided to go to his illness and began to inform , and this with such dedication that He has just celebrated his 43rd birthday .
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara ( HCG ) , in which he came after several battles in 1994 .
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , which at the beginning of the 1990s was difficult to see how many doubts , few treatment options and more stigma .
At that time , it avoided even the director of a clinic of the IMSS , to say goodbye , `` because it led to a dead end . ''
At the time , AIDS was synonymous with death .
Today , it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life .
But many people in the clinic , who know nothing about their illness and the virus has already caused damage and has exhausted her immune system , and are the victims of opportunistic infections .
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world , in other words , after the first reported cases , `` the great success today means that the survival of a patient who treatment in time , and the survival of the general population are exactly the same , '' said the head of the HIV unit of HCG , Jaime Andrade Villanueva , and he said that this information had been supported by a respected scientific publication in April of this year .
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS , Andrade Villanueva , commented that the scientists since the 2008 inferred that AIDS is not a death sentence , but that the years of survival and quality of life the degree of impairment of the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment , and that would have greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs : up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4 .
Simply put , the above mean that , at the age of 25 years who gets diagnosed HIV positive , in that sense , `` can easily be 75 years old , as long as it is under control , '' said the expert .
In order to this progress , it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans an average of 76 years .
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years ( in Mexico , the number of people who die from AIDS , from cases in 2007 to in 2011 ( annual report of the ONUSIDA ) reduced ) , it is true that since the advent of AIDS , 60 percent of of the patients have died in the national database .
In the year 2011 255 people died in Jalisco , and the month of May this year there are 187 deaths since 2005 , but assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral medicines .
- Why so people are still dying ?
- In my opinion , is not the problem of access to treatment .
This is my opinion , and it is in our hospital .
At least in the past 12 years we have had no problems with the supply of drugs . The problem is that the people in an advanced state , because they do not know their infection , in very late stages of the disease .
He makes a powerful statement : `` Nine out of ten patients come to us , if you already have an accompanying infection . In order to be able to influence the global mortality , earlier diagnoses are necessary , and that is why all the people , where it is massive screening tests must be offered . ''
This proposal , the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco ( Coesida ) ( national committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco ) and patients such as Fabrizio , who was already carry out its test at a private laboratory , and for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him , despite his young age in the AIDS stage , and even the Kaposi 's sarcoma ( a cancerous tumor ) , which is one of the usual complications .
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS .
Some think that they will die , and do not want to hear .
`` If I have to die , then it is three times burst , '' said , in my case .
The change was to improve , I ernähre well , and take the medication .
Today , his parents know only that he had cancer .
I live a normal life , like everyone else .
`` I am a lot , I have an active , but responsible , I am to my health and that of the other person , '' Fabrizio , which agreed to share intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO , to encourage those who have with his testimony today in the context of the global AIDS day .
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group . The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive , the better , and if they already know the diagnosis , they should learn how to live like all people .
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizen , there are major holes , said Ricardo Salazar , a journalist from Guadalajara , which has taken up the cause of HIV .
And the most important thing is prevention .
`` In certain places , the distribution of condoms was actually increased ; , they were , now they give us packages with hundreds of pieces , which is good , but there are still people who do not have access to a condom , '' he said .
The risk for new infections among young people .
`` What do you need ? '' Is a widespread derision question of social workers , guidance staff in schools , employees in pharmacies and health system , the young people do not want to expose the correspondent .
He proposed to this inefficient distribution ; the condoms are not only behind the counter , but output devices in public toilet facilities , which are often visited by young people .
It should not be promoted promiscuity .
They shall not be paid for the beer and Motel , as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration .
`` Sexuality is not enough ; it is the best way to bring the closer to those who already have a sexual activity , '' he brought it to the point .
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases ( 12,158 and 1,317 HIV ) .
The state is seen in 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases , and in 13th place in relation to HIV .
92 % of cases of infection through sexual intercourse , 6 % of the blood and 2 % .
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV , because there are for every registered case 4 or 5 people who do not know It .

`` The great and powerful '' leads to Moscow : migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activist , the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants , criminals are already with fake certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow , St. Petersburg and other Russian cities in Russia .
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
Their only aim is to make money for the upkeep of the remaining families in the home .
On December 1 , a law came into force , according to which every migrant labor , a test of the knowledge of the Russian language .
So far , this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector , in the local housing and retail .
But the tests are to be over time , according to the migration authority for all migrant workers in the future .
It is not only language tests , but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation .
Language skills must be established for the preservation and the extension of the work permit .
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language .
There are Also exempt from this law , people who have received their training certificates and diplomas from the collapse of the USSR in 1991 .
Meaning , and the protection of the rights issue
The whole of the will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language , the Russian University of people , the Moscow State University , the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities .
The migrants will be able to take the tests in all cities ; now , have already opened more than 160 such centers were in Russia .
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the federal immigration authorities .
Civil rights activist , on the whole thing , before the entry into force of the law several times in the press , the following question : what does it actually mean ?
What changes to the , language skills , both for the Russians and the guest workers ?
Above all , spokesman for the migration authority , it is to reduce the number of forced laborers .
`` Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers , '' says the head of the representation of the federal immigration authorities in Tajikistan , Viktor Sebelew .
Their rights , however , must be protected before their departure .
Only an organized recruitment to 90 % will solve the problems of foreign workers .
On the problems migrants without jobs , education , language skills and medical assessment .
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills will inevitably encounter people with bad intentions , which is under the pretext of aid in a dark , narrow barracks , where he met with dozens of his peers months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day .
We are receiving many complaints from our migrants .
`` In the home you one thing , and on arrival , you have been cheated In their passports and do not receive the promised wages , '' the head of the labour migration of Tajik migration authority , Tolib Schwaripow .
It is not , boss !
However , many citizens of the Central Asian republics , who want to earn their money in Russia , too , that they do not know not only the language of the country , but also in their own language to express in writing .
Of course , that is not so much their fault , but rather the problem : few Turkmen , Uzbeks and Tajiks can only afford a sound basic education .
In their families , there is not even money to feed the children , let alone to buy decent clothes , shoes and school .
As a teenager , these children then immediately take the first opportunity to earn money .
`` It is difficult without language skills , '' .
`` You feel humiliated and inferior . ''
Civil rights activists say the following important aspect of the law .
The test only migrants with legal status .
If you do not have this status , there is no and , consequently , no official work .
Meanwhile , the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia .
`` Welcome '' or `` forbidden access to banned ''
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia .
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and , of course , The linguistic difficulties .
In addition , the legalisation of costs money : 12 to 16 thousand rubles .
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand .
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents and we are not registered , and then to cases of blackmail .
`` They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea , '' the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists .
`` Spare no expense for false papers . ''
On the day when the law came into force , it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified .
Some counterfeit certificates , the completion of the language tests , have already been by members of the federal Migration Agency .
The fake papers have been printed with a normal color printer .
Of course , the new owners were not in vain : any migrant , who hoped to be able to save the tests , paid for the document seven thousand rubles .
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test : It costs a three thousand rubles .
That is the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption , so that the certificates can be bought , both officials and civil rights activist .
For the moment , the authorities can guest workers , who are covered by the test for the first time , that you get time for a language course .
In addition , new arrivals without language skills will be offered in areas where no active communication with people .

Petronella Wyatt : I was bullied out of Oxford , because I am Tory
Not only university students today are being attacked for her views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford .
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought was the largest knowledge stamp in the world , for a modern Greek symposium , the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance - .
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College at the end of the - I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life .
My father broke down in tears .
My friends were confused .
In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone , because I would have had a problem with fellow students in the adjacent room had sex .
The author of A N Wilson said , I would have left the university , because I was forced to drink from damaged cups .
But the truth was less amusing .
I ran away .
Yes , because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats .
Not because of my unusual name , or because I had come from a private school .
I had harassed me for one reason only - a cause that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment : my late father now Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and supporter of the Conservative Party .
Why do I mention this now ?
Now , according to latest reports , a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution .
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week , the same equal protection of gays , the disabled and ethnic minorities .
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room ( JCR ) of the Corpus Christi College , they are often actively isolated because of their political views `` personally attacked and declared undesirable . ''
They are calling for a place in the equality of their college , in order to ensure that their views can be freely expressed .
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two , `` Wonderland : Young , Bright and on the Right , '' the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis .
Joe Cooke , a former president of the conservative student association has been shown , among other things , It was of the University of Oxford , who drove in a Rolls Royce and with silver suit and .
At other universities say conservative students , they are as `` scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees . ''
The 20-year-old Luke Black , vice president of the conservative Students of the University of Nottingham , said in a Sunday newspaper : `` There is a growing tendency to universities .
People think we are like the Bullingdon club , without us to at all. ``
Samuel Roberts , 21 , a student in Corpus Christi , who initiated the request for greater protection , believes such a climate is `` uncomfortable . '' The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill , president-elect of the conservative student association of Oxford says she watched with , members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right .
`` This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the of the members , '' she says .
In my first weeks in Oxford , I was part of a minority .
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I had arrived in September 1986 .
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak .
In the Last year , the university voted for Margaret Thatcher , a former student - as a result of cuts in higher education to give title .
The atmosphere would have been even Stalinists .
In the first days of the week , get to know the new students and tutors , I received a taste of the future events .
I made the experience that the tutors mockery of Tory students not only tolerated , but even with joy .
Political issues such as the miners ' strike , privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums .
In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English . What should have been , I was not taken .
`` Miss Wyatt , '' said the tutor Harry Pitt ( now deceased ) , `` please translate the first paragraph . ''
I stumbled .
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough , and .
`` Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French , or are you just stupid ? '' He asked me .
The other students .
In my eyes wallten tears .
`` I suggest that you take a few French hours in your free time , if you are not too busy with your social activities , '' Pitt growled at me .
I returned with hängendem head in my room .
On this evening , I sat alone in the college at the dinner when someone typed me slightly on the shoulder .
It was an English student from the second year named James , who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association .
`` I know who you are , '' he said .
Unfortunately , it is , as it is .
Anyone who is suspected of being a Tory , .
For me , it is bad enough , but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so it will be worse For you .
Most Tory , to be supporters of the Labour Party .
In a local pub I later tried to distract me .
I insisted that I was not entirely agree with Mrs Thatcher .
This trick should prove unsuccessful .
A number of new entrants in philosophy , politics and economy , which had visited as a conservative force , ironically , the Eton College , said to me : `` You are the daughter of a fascist pig . ''
You are dirty .
Other students shared his opinion .
I was perverse and dirty .
`` As the Tories have sex ? '' Asked me one .
The beat each other , right ?
I felt so as homosexuals had to have felt before the more liberal legislation in the United States .
I Would ever be able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford ?
I would like to meet like-minded people only after nightfall ?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations ?
The three years before me , I extended to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation .
The only tutor , who as a Tory , was Norman Stone , professor of contemporary history , which had its headquarters in my college .
It was not only hated to be a conservative , but also because he advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy and had written speeches for them .
He was rarely there .
He hated the place it was parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective .
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey .
`` You will not be happy here , '' he said .
I started to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city .
My father told me that I hated , and why I did it .
He seemed incredulous .
During his time in the forties , all political views were accepted .
`` But it is the best place in the world , '' he said sheepishly .
This is something like that they would never do in my city of dreaming spires .
Even my communist friends , always impeccable manners .
Tarnished his moist eyes .
A chance .
I am sure you neckt .
It would break my heart if you were walking .
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London , my emotional resistance weaker .
One of my male friends , also Tory supporters , had succumbed to the pressure and his convictions .
During a Tutoriums in the following week , in which claimed another history tutor seriously , I was `` an enemy of the people , '' I decided to do the same .
Although I secretly in shame , I admitted that my parents to a `` brainwashing '' and called them `` old sucker . ''
The relief lasted only briefly .
It was my father , who was the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career .
At that time , he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch press .
My door was locked .
I hid myself in my room , and after five minutes gave my persecutors .
As they went , I was a bag and took the first train to London .
I never returned .
You can call me a weinerlichen wimp .
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution .
And it is tragic that it was an university of Oxford , who did not only 14 Tory prime Minister , but until now hidden behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought .

`` The brain can be so far only moderately ''
The issue of the enlarged reality is perceived by supporters of modern technologies in recent times , usually through the lens of a special glasses .
Google first presented at its annual conference in the summer , a working model in November , it was announced that Microsoft had filed a patent .
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi , however , it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a staging post .
The ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces .
- Please describe your , which operates research group .
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine , but want to extend the boundaries of this interaction .
So far , humanity is in the period , which works with pixels on flat screens , which are sometimes affected .
However , we want to look ahead 5-10 years , and the radical changes of this interaction .
For example , the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward , and today is no Xbox sold without , because everyone interested in motion control .
- What awaits us in the future ?
- Although Kinect interaction on a physical level , much is still on the flat screen , sometimes in 3D .
The input of information ( the system gets more data ) could be improved , the issue has not yet .
We are trying to change the work on real three-dimensional display systems based on the basis of various technologies , including projections .
We have to lay off the computer world in our physical world and make them more .
To this end , it is important that not only the user , but also its surroundings .
Then we could add to the real world much easier to virtual objects .
And the first and foremost , we should be of virtual reality helmets !
- What do you think of voice ?
It is popular , but It will not be overrated ?
- It is certainly not the solution , because it raises questions about privacy , because they do not like to inform all others about its actions and intentions .
In fact , any kind of interaction with computers is good , but each in their particular niche .
For example , we worked in the area of the management of objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and tight , with sprawling gestures .
The gestures were not recorded by the camera , but by a bracelet registered the movements of the bones and muscles .
It is still relatively large , but in theory , could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch .
But overall , the future belongs to , for example , gestures and language .
- Like that ?
For example , We would ask me to reach out to you this ?
They say it and , at the same time .
- Normally , I will say it .
- Oh , that would be very difficult to detect .
- That you want the user adapt to what can be a machine at the time and what is not ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mutual rapprochement .
I think that we in the near future , in particular on the development of new types of sensors , which make it possible to the people .
The laser sensors , for example , could be because they are in the depth of a good resolution , which is very important .
- What do you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras ?
There is a lack of resolution , depth or something else ?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection .
Of course , would not be 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps .
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself , but the quality of the matrix and depth .
So all current technologies are not good enough for us , because the developers of the algorithms have more work .
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y , but also along the .
The speed and the number of frames per second are important .
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic and , frankly , the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little .
Stephen Betishes in our lab in Redmond , developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds , with today 's commercial sensors closer to the second value ( 60 to 100 ) .
Not all understand how much it affects the interaction between man and machine .
I needed for my work as a device , only without the control and with more images per second .
- Would not be increased the number of cameras ?
- Kinect is currently working with three `` cameras , '' one of them is actually an infrared transmitter , and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal .
And the third camera is actually a RGB camera .
It is not used to calculate the object .
More cameras could possibly solve the problem .
Or the problem , as more calculations would be necessary .
It would be nice , to a flexible , system in which we could play with different camera tendencies to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional identifying a position .
- If I remember correctly , Microsoft , in contrast to Google , his glasses , not the public .
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life , the lens has the best prospects ?
- Of course , it is not pleasant , always on the way to keep a smartphone in your hand , but I think the following : the best option would be a `` temporary '' augmented reality in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone ,
The lens is a personal and therein lies its strength ( private , you can only see ) , but at the same time its weakness , because an enlarged reality through glasses that you can work together with others in virtual objects .
Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air , not only Tony Stark in Iron Man , but also ordinary mortal .
There is a problem that critics often point out of this idea : There is no tangible response .
The hands feel nothing at all .
What answers to give your group at this point ?
- In my lectures , I often talk about the fact that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough In the interaction between man and machine .
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception .
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as somewhat unusual projection .
It takes pressure !
But there are also technologies that are on the `` pictures in the air '' to give something , for example , the interference of some ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger , a feeling , but that is still so weak as someone on the .
There are also bands for the wrist , on the nerve endings in the fingers , it is also a potential direction .
- Have you tried to outflank the brain ?
We think that it can feel what it should feel if it sees something ?
- This is a good idea , so we have not tried it yet .
Here is another challenge facing us that we will have to fight for a long time , is that people who are physically in a closed room to believe , , it is instead in an open , virtually infinite space ; we are working on concepts with treadmills ( other than in the ) , mobile platforms and large balls .
So far , the brain can only moderately , and we still have many busy years of work .
It is that makes the work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive : in many issues , we are only at the beginning .

The word of human rights `` is missing in the Constitution . ''
The revolution has returned to Cairo .
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country .
The future Constitution with Sharia law as The basis is controversial .
The Egyptian president not sparing with pathos .
We need to make the transition .
`` And that he will succeed is my responsibility before the people and before God , '' he said on state television .
His speech was addressed to all the people , but above all , the Christian Copts , the liberals , enlightened Muslims and secular .
Because all of them , so far , hopelessly divided in a confused opposition , fear .
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood .
He has said almost entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi , the powers of the constitutional court temporarily and its competences , `` in order to save the revolution . ''
But what of the 61-year-old engineer who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California , really wants to save , the Egyptians , the world is not quite clear .
The judiciary should be ousted ?
In fact , the 234 articles of the constituent assembly in a , were pushed through , in part , worrying .
As in previous constitutions , in the draft , the case law based on the `` principles of Islamic law . ''
But what is called `` principles '' ?
That was and is open to interpretation , and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law .
This suggests at least a new article : in all matters concerning the Sharia law must be given to the Al-Azhar university , the country 's main Islamic institution with great clout in the of the entire Sunni Islam .
This is not , but it may mean that the the legislation , which would be the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary .
In the Verfassunsgsentwurf is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic : the civilian military justice is to be maintained .
These dishes served during Mubarak 's rule for the repression of .
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military custody .
The state should also , as stated in the draft , `` the true nature of the Egyptian family '' to protect `` and promote its morals and values . ''
This is legally so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even could control the content of film , art and literature .
In plain English , this means nothing other than censorship .
In fact , no article expressly stipulates equality between men and women .
For another , prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to or slander .
But what an insult is and how it should be punished , remains unclear .
As is the wording of the `` insulting people '' should be banned .
There is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a Leader ?
Interpretation , like so much in the draft , which is to be Morsi , and in his to , `` very soon '' for the referendum will be presented to the Egyptians .
`` The revolution has returned ''
The opposition is for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists .
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter , before it can enter into force .
`` The revolution has returned and we will win , '' said Hamdin Sabbahi , Drittplatzierter MB ) of The presidential elections .
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed El-Baradei said , belong to the draft constitution `` on the scrapheap of history . ''
Via text messaging service Twitter , he accused Morsi 's supporters , `` a '' coup against democracy .
`` If he proclaims the referendum , we will go to his palace and him , '' said the opposition persuade Yasser said .
`` We are not yet tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet , '' the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali .
And several judges announced that they would not to supervise the referendum , which would be invalid .
`` The Koran is our constitution . ''
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood , for its part , to , but not in Tahrir Square , but after a mass prayer on the other Apollonopolis before the Cairo University .
Many veiled women and supporters of the took part , `` the people demand the application of God 's law . ''
They demanded that Morsi : `` Säubere the country ! '' And protested : `` the Koran is our constitution . ''
A battle for control of the symbolic Tahrir Square , where it all began , would probably have created civil affairs .
Did not want to risk of Morsi 's supporters .
The Muslim Brotherhood , both opponents of the draft constitution and supporters have spoken loud and clear .
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go .
A majority in favour of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe .
`` The word of human rights , is not even ''
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process , which would have until February and involve all social forces .
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for human rights ( EOHR ) defended the Muslim Brotherhood , as they were under Mubarak in prison or in court .
Not because he would share their beliefs , but because of the human rights are indivisible .
He was beaten , convicted , imprisoned .
`` And now is not the word of human rights in the new constitution , '' he complained in the interview with the Welt am Sonntag `` .
Morsi power extension to all three branches in the state of the lawyer .
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game , and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship .
`` Instead of civil society , the president de facto , '' complained Saeda .
But without civil society organisations could not work a democracy .
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community , which considers the ideological struggle on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement .
This could take revenge .
A protester in Tahrir warns : `` you gebährt a monster , you can no longer control . ''

In Colorado , there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the southeast of Colorado for an offence in court , which in this state will soon be legal : the possession of a few chunk of marijuana and a pipe , with which he smoked it .
According to Orozco , he and some friends on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas , when they were stopped .
After the police officers found marijuana in the car , Orozco was for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - , each with a penalty of US $ 100 - and received a court date .
`` We are treated like criminals , '' said Orozco .
But it is also a ?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use , the answer depends less on hundreds of minor drug on the law , on the site .
Hundreds of , which revolve around marijuana , here and in the state of Washington , the approved similar measures have already dropped .
The police authorities are adults over 21 years longer for possession of small . This is allowed by law , once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks .
But prosecutors in more conservative districts Colorados have announced to follow existing marijuana offenses , and people are still in court .
At the same time voting in several cities , from the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains on new , to prevent a state licensed marijuana shops in the opening in their communities .
`` This situation is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next , '' says Daniel J. Oates , police chief in Aurora , which is located east of Denver .
And regulators in the state of Washington , scratch on the .
They are waiting for a guide to set up a licensing system for the production , manufacture , distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013 .
In Washington , the conventional wisdom is that in any case , most states of Colorado , with regard to the regulation of marijuana . There was only legalized the drug for medical purposes and then for private consumption .
`` Colorado has a more regulated market . Orientation of the state is , '' said Brian E. Smith , spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington .
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide .
`` We have no real precedent that we can follow , '' he adds .
The Washington law , called I-502 , enters into force on 6 December and the end of a grey area in which the government licensing system does not yet exist , but it is legalized the possession .
And unpleasant practice questions need to be addressed at this time - for example , as the government of a `` reasonable access '' to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools , parks , playgrounds and child care facilities to be agreed .
`` Nowhere is it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas , particularly in the area of Seattle , '' says Ben Livingston , spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis , `` a recently formed research group .
On 21 November sent Chief Oates an email to his employees in Aurora , in which he said that the prosecutor would not pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years longer , and that the police `` '' will not for these offences .
The police Chief Oates added that will continue to enforce the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and urban targets would continue to pursue drug traffickers .
In Weld County In northern Colorado represents County prosecutor Ken Buck a stricter view .
After the vote , he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession , mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal .
Currently , 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court , even though many have been charged for other offenses .
`` Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations , in which it to the point of the offence , '' Buck said in a statement .
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County , where voters rejected the marijuana initiative , ambivalent .
The police in Grand Junction , the largest city in the district , shows adults for the possession of small amounts of not longer .
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision , but not all outstanding possession proceedings .
`` I do not think that I 'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes , '' he says .
Although 55 % of voters supported the measure in Colorado , it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system .
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound dilemma among local officials , the big green experiment .
In a `` cultural barrier , '' said Sean McAllister , a lawyer from Denver , the defendants standing trial for marijuana crimes , and as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws .
`` They have spent a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for it , that they can still do not accept the legalization , '' he believes .
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol , Colorado and Washington acted as a national model for the legalization of drugs .
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an age of legal , they are also nervous wait on orders of the federal government , which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime .
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice .
Despite several high-profile arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana , the federal government allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado , Washington and 16 other states .
Kevin A. Sabet , a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that no doors will likely to seize smaller quantities of drugs , but probably will resist the legal under the new legislation to by the state regulated marijuana shops .
Several cities in Colorado , not just wait for the fact that the federal authorities .
Even before the election day , some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops , although this could open in about a year .
Last week decided Montrose , a city in the West , a six-month ban , which will probably be adopted next week .
`` We do not want to get into a position where we license and then at the federal level are facing a major problem , '' Bob Nicholson , a member of the city council .
Our community has voted against this legislation .
We have done this for the community , not , for what the state decided .
There are still many questions unanswered .

Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road , companies in the main building industry , political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia every day to tell what they know about a great `` system , '' in the construction industry , civil servants , politicians , trade unionists and Mafioso involved .
`` Industry , '' which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec , particularly in the 1990s and 2000s .
`` It is strange how the system is falling apart , since It has taken drastic measures , '' witzelt Jacques Duchesneau , MEP in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal .
The scandal was exposed by on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the treaties to road in Quebec , which had only reluctantly agreed to the former prime minister .
The `` Duchesneau report '' established a direct link between industry , secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials .
`` Since the beginning of the study in 2010 , '' he said , `` the transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars in the of the Treaties , '' because some zügelten its instinct to get their share .
The Charbonneau Commission `` has already brought two mayors to case , '' he adds , in the hope that she `` demonstrate the tactics behind the individuals . ''
Launched in 2011 , A permanent anti-corruption unit
In 2011 , permanent anti-corruption unit and analysts of the with their troops to auditors , the government is also a great effort .
In addition , the police force , `` , '' which since 2009 has ensured that the `` '' Montreal in the artificial inflation of the Treaties restrained ...
In recent weeks , it has made by the house searches and raised allegations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte , who is the mayor of a suburb .
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt , who is from his post as mayor of Laval , the third largest city of Quebec , has resigned .
He is suspected , in exchange for public contracts repeatedly bribes .
In fact , engineers were accused of Montreal , and of Italian origin , as well as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito .
The latter has caused a stir by the Commission has the function of the `` system '' for the preservation of public contracts .
He has for several years of 3 % of the value of the contracts in Montreal to a the in connection with the Mafia , which It paid for the money to the Union Montreal party of mayor Gérald Tremblay .
Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game in the 2000s , more than 88,000 Canadian dollars ( about 68,000 euros ) province of parties , especially the Liberals , in power at that time .
He also confessed to illegal fund-raising for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau .

The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described in detail the Commission : in ten years ago , he received from the construction company gifts , invitations to travel , golf tournaments , restaurants and ice hockey games , as well as bribes to the amount of $ 736,000 in exchange for contracts , which it .
Other officials of the road Administration have admitted that they were , by the bills artificially with false additional services by 30-40 % .
In addition , an organizer of the party of the mayor , Martin Dumont , accused Mr Tremblay , that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget , which filled its coffers with black money .
As a result of these revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November , Montreal , which is a serious crisis .
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal , the alarm .
As mayor of the district , in the east of the island , they from 2010 against the sale of municipal land that for $ 5 million and was sold for 1.6 million of property developers in the booming real estate market .
70 % of black money in election campaigns
The study will be carried out in the end , she says that `` on a thread , which , which makes it possible to understand the function of the system of ants in order to stop the evil and the culprits . ''
She says that the process is `` painful , but positive . ''
We are about to clean the wound , however , need a certain investigative unit , as well as for Montreal and supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices .
How do you clean .
On a regular basis .
Jacques Duchesneau , for his part , notes that `` officials have stolen from several hundred million dollars , '' but above all concerned about the role of the `` over the tactics in the picture , '' if they were not involved in the fraud .
On the basis of a 70 % black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec , he jokes : `` I was told that this was only a weak simulacrum of reality . ''
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $ 100 , according to what he would change nothing in the situation : `` as long as the election campaign spending will not be strictly limited , black money in politics . ''
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public contracts and the financing of the parties : `` we can not fall deeper ; to the things with courage , we can build the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws . ''
If this story is the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal , Mr. Duchesneau those who laugh about it , to take a look in their own backyard .

We are withdrawing from Afghanistan .
And after that ?
French troops have their responsibility in Afghanistan ( Kapisa and Surobi ) .
NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014 .
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of their territory , and that the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us .
We have to be punished , in particular , the Afghan farmers by we have seen them as terrorists .
And ourselves with our 88 slain soldiers , as well as the injured and .
The Taliban are of foreign extremists , former leaders who have fled to Pakistan , but also often from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence , such as at the time of the Soviets .
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions , even if they are jihadists , Pakistanis , Arabs , Uzbeks and Tajiks .
Tolerated , sometimes backed by the local insurgents , the latter will not be there if the Western countries .
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab , which I watched from a hill , which was financed with the help of French loans , was carried out properly .
The helicopters überflogenen trucks and armored convoys have reached Kabul , without being attacked .
From the end of 2014 , there will be no more of the Taliban in Kabul .
Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996 , the conditions have changed .
At the time Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war .
At the time of Their power was seen as a kind of liberation and return to safety .
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the Al qaeda overwhelmed by the farmers , but their situation has not improved .
Former Mujahideen , the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep the women in a subordinate position .
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001 .
They have turned into this racket property seized by the government , in order to sell it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan , and thus benefit from the massive American subcontracting .
They have been discredited , and most of them were not involved in the fighting .
As I have heard in the campaign , people want a government that is not of thieves .
Many young people want to leave the country , such as those that American contributions to take advantage of the : the flight of capital .
The young people have had enough of the war and its ideology .
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan , they have had contact with the modern world , and have enjoyed the benefits .
About 65 % of the population is under 25 years ; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants , which is a fifth of the total population .
In the cities , the state schools are full of girls and boys .
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties to the corruption of certain executives , they will have to make jobs available .
Everyone , including the armed parties , are obsessed with mobile phones , television with its Turkish series , which is a modern world , everywhere .
An army is now available .
The authorities , under whose command they will be seen as legitimate ?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the of the militias in the province , which the power of the central government .
Afghanistan , the land of the mountains with strong local identities should benefit from a degree of decentralisation in the Western nations , but the abolition of the office of the prime minister , since the constitution of 1964 , the United States wanted to make a centralised state with a strong presidential power .
President Karzai does not want foreign inspections , especially at the time of the elections scheduled for April 2014 .
However , his country since the 1950s , and long dependent on foreign aid .
Industries have not been rebuilt , are and important irrigation system has not been repaired .
Everything is imported ; apart from fruit and vegetables , nothing is produced .
The private initiative is The priority .
In a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war , would have been a state control of the infrastructure needed .
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources .
This reinforces the impression that Western countries were only there to seize it .
Without energy , in order to process iron or mining is not possible Without the means of transport for export over the mountains .
The Chinese have left the copper mine of Mes Aynak almost international archaeologists ( funded by the World Bank ) on the vast Buddhist site their excavations and remain the major employers in the province .
One day it will be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , which are largely dependent on imports and exports to restore normal relations .
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November .
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls and boys in high schools , Institute for French universities , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural sectors , the support of the archaeological delegation .
Since 2009 , has a service `` civilian-military actions '' of the Ministry of Defence ( Cimic ) , which the 2012 has been carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and a small French non-governmental organisation , in order to try to win the `` hearts and minds '' and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions .
This work , for which many local workers were needed , can help to suppress the uprising : irrigation , wells , drinking water , reforestation , fruit trees , soil protection and improvement of agricultural land .
We leave after military spending of two billion euros ?
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions that are very hard in these valleys often at a height of more than 2000 meters .
In the message made dozens of written questions small agricultural projects of municipalities of the province of Kapisa .
The farmers of the rebellion led by foreign groups , which is their desire for their own statements , would be the continuation of low , well controlled and directly relevant civilian aid to their benefit .

`` PSG is not the FC Barcelona ! ''
In this season , you have a new deal with PSG .
How do you explain this progress ?
You can explain it through a personal insight , but also by the new dimension of PSG .
Great players .
Every day I am on their side .
The technical staff gave me a lot .
These factors spur me every day to improve my game .
And in a game that is even easier .
In football , everything is going very quickly .
But I must stop in enthusiasm .
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my game time at Saint Etienne I have always made gradual progress .
They make the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti .
The new entrants this summer are used to make a very high levels .
They also know that every training session .
This means that a player like me , the forehead and wants to give his best .
Incidentally , it gives me Carlo Ancelotti a lot in terms of my game .
It is supported by other such as Claude Makelele , who played in the same position as me .
Ancelotti is the right person for the job ?
Of course .
Ancelotti breathes all technicians respect .
In the Ligue 1 , there is currently no comparable person , and he is one of the best coaches In Europe .
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs .
He had contact with great players .
I think he will win another title in Paris .
In January , I had an encouraging conversation with him .
At that time , I had just recovered from a series of injury .
The trust that he has put in me , it is also an explanation for my services .
What do you think about the first part of the season for PSG ?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the us .
We are in the ambush .
One of our main objectives is the Champions League : we have qualified for the World Cup in this way .
What is the objective of the association in this competition ?
We will try to get as far as possible .
From now on , everything is possible .
However , we will have our say , a very good European teams .
First of all , we want to be the First of our group in Porto , so that we can deliver the return leg of the final home game .
The PSG can become a major European club in the short term ?
He has already in the budget for it ...
In order to become a major European club , Paris must win the title and make a name for the long term .
This is not the case today .
The PSG is financial resources , so that this project is taking shape .
It would be a great failure to win the title in the Ligue 1 , as was the case last season ?
Of course , this would be a great disappointment .
This year , it is really important to us , the of This title .
In the last season we were close .
In May , we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory .
We have finished the season with a very strong performance .
We have finished with 79 points .
Normally , you should be with 79 points ...
But another team , those of Montpellier , has made an even better season .
I believe that this year is the right one .
Even if the big teams like Marseille , Lyon or Bordeaux are vying for the title , I believe that we have what it takes to win it .
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG ?
In view of what has been invested , and the players we have , it is natural that much is expected of us .
We fully accept that .
If we win , with a home game against Troyes 4-0 , and you still find something you can accuse us , that is frustrating .
One wonders what people expect .
We could never win every weekend with 4-0 .
We are not the FC Barcelona .
We are trying to set up a game plan .
A team builds over time .
In the Champions League , we have shown strength .
Look at Manchester City , a club for two seasons , fails to qualify for the final , and also has made huge spending .
In terms of the sums invested was believed to break with 15 points ahead .
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup .
Lyon and Marseille , who were not well in the last season of this new PSG were good , `` geboostet . ''
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting .
I hope that we will be in the month of May , the smiling winner and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties .
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic .
The better that you speak of a `` Zlatan dependence . ''
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many goals .
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1 .
Wherever he has played , he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star .
Within the team , we respect both the player and the person .
He also respects the people who surrounded him .
What he has done is truly extraordinary .
This inspires others to improve their game .
Thiago Silva , who is also one of the world 's best defenders , allowing everyone to make progress .
As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team ?
As a disappointment .
It was to take part in this European championship .
Unfortunately , my injury has prevented me from being able to some game time .
I saw things that I am stronger .
Today , I will be able to achieve good games in the national team .
This was my baptism with the `` Bleus '' my hope .
From what has happened in Ukraine , we have learned our lesson , and today we have an exemplary behaviour .
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the `` Bleus '' ?
He has achieved promising results .
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup .
The national coach is strict , is close to the players and to the victory .
As it was also Laurent Blanc .
But I would not like to make a comparison .
Blanc had achieved its goal , he had qualified for the European Championships .
I hope that Didier Deschamps , the `` Bleus '' will lead to Brazil .
The forced draw on 16 October in Spain ( 1 : 1 ) an opening game ?
This game has given us confidence .
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else .
Before this meeting in Spain , I have never seen a similar game in my career .

In this sense , he defended the project to create a South American citizenship , the member states of the Unasur .
`` We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries , as is already in the Andean Community , but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past , '' he warned .
The President of Ecuador also advocated the of the Organization of American States ( OEA ) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the Agreement of San Jose on human rights .
Those who teach , never commit to something , and in return , we will sign the South Americans .
`` It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights , based in Washington , and is funded by the United States , '' he said as a reference to the political asylum , Ecuador , the founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange .
Correa said that he does not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles , but his `` deep democratic values and views on human rights . ''
He added that it had given `` at the time , that Assange extradited to a third country and would not be complied with procedures . ''
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary , which requires him to submit to an interrogation on its territory because of an alleged sexual offence , while `` the Swedish law allows this through a video conference on the Ecuador Embassy in London could have been carried out . ''
Correa said that there was a danger that would affect the health and mental condition of Assange .
`` Since then in our message , I have not spoken with him , the ambassador has informed me , however , that he has a slight problem with the lungs , but it is not serious , '' said the head of state of Ecuador .
There is a danger , though , that he would physical and psychological damage , because he was caught in a tight space and no physical exercises outdoors .
`` That would affect the health of every human being , '' he added .
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum , Assange was granted to the month of June at the embassy of Ecuador in London was in the granting of a , which could travel to Ecuador , and that this is in the hands of the United Kingdom , Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe . He said he pointed out that there had been talks with London , in order to find a solution for the jailed founder of WikiLeaks .
We do not act with human rights , we do not apply in this case , however , there have been ongoing discussions .
`` The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom , Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe , because the lawyer of Assange , Baltazar Garzón , a set of procedures at various European institutions , '' he said .
`` If Britain morning granted the licence , I believe that in my opinion , this is done . ''
And if Sweden Mr. Assange on the embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogated over Skype , as allowed under Swedish law , and in other cases , the problem is the .
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate `` the mediocrity , the bad faith and the freedom of expression . ''
`` The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politician , but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail , '' he said .
In this sense , that he congratulated Ecuador more dominated by such journalists `` and not the bankers or hegemonic and countries , '' , and he is in a re-election `` will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction . ''
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections , arguing that the organism `` must stand firm and no opportunism and no legal coup d'etat , '' because it `` , the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed . ''

It is a problem between the South and Central American state .
Conflicts are inevitable , but they need to be overcome in the pursuit of a common path .
They must be dealt with comprehensively , so that we can overcome and look forward .
He also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that `` it is right for Latin America to international bodies , if both countries agree to accept the verdict , even if it is very hard . ''
With regard to the possibility that he presents himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador , in order to reach his third mandate in , he admitted that he sees the `` with a lot of optimism and joy , even though it is sometimes very difficult . ''
Correa promised that if he could lose the elections in February 2013 , he would withdraw from political life .
Has never interested me personally , but in doing so , as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power .
`` My political movement had the belief that I was the likely victory guaranteed , so I must assume this responsibility , '' he said .
If I were to win , it would be my last term as president , then I am withdrawing from public life .
This is also true that if we lose .
`` It has been decided , '' he said .
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela , Hugo Chávez , in Cuba .
I have just with the vice president of Venezuela , Nicolás Maduro . He told me that he had traveled for a planned routine treatment there , and that would be expected after the election campaign that he could travel back to Cuba .

Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapurer lay the blame for the fact that they have no children , the career , the stress and the cost of housing and education .
`` The people of Singapore must grow . ''
I am a patriotic husband , you are my patriotic wife : we are fulfilling our civic duty and we create life !
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons yet , or precisely because of this , they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore , a viral video on YouTube .
The sentences are part of a rapper songs , the local slogans such as `` , '' bao `` ( loaf ) in the oven to start worrying about the low birth rate in Singapore .
The advertising company , which shot the video , preserves the hope that the advert funny way to draw attention to the problem .
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their `` national duty . ''
This is something only for the Internet , so we had to make it fun and funny .
It is the biggest problem in this country .
The , we are the worst in the world , so we realized that it is an issue we had to take care of .
We knew that the government had tried many things , such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of speed Dating evenings ( fast flirts ) .
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative , but they did not necessarily lead to success .
So we thought : why not make something as creative as possible , in order to address this problem , for example , to compose a rap ?
1.2 children
If you do not take this lightly , is the government of Singapore .
Each year , they are US dollars for political action to encourage citizens to have more children .
A package of government grants for married couples and parents up to $ 15,000 per child , extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits .
But everything has so far had little success .
Singapore is a wealthy , in southeast Asia , which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls .
In accordance with its national population authority , the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman .
The last time , when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976 .
So why not get more children ?
Tan Wei Ming , director of marriage and family policy of the national population authority , says that this was a `` better education '' and `` greater career opportunities . ''
`` This has enabled people to marry and to form a family more options in terms of life goals and priorities , '' she says .
These changes in the social conditions have contributed to the higher number of people living alone , and delaying marriage and births , the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore .
Meanwhile , an immigration policy that led to a drastic increase in the to counter the reduction of the population , resentment among the local population .
In Singapore , there are websites where barely masked xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing , especially against the Chinese , who are criticised for the low wages and not integrate .
The rise in immigration is seen as one of the reasons for the fact that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence .
Since the elections , there was an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers .
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate , the impact on economic growth of a nation that tax revenues , the cost of health care and immigration policy , the example shows Singapore unexpected consequences .
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are to be built .
It already has an impact on the housing market .
The authority for urban development has started to control the number of small apartments , which are known as the `` shoe boxes '' and can not be built in certain areas of the city .
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and a great sales success .
However , there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the people living alone , and that they discourage construction companies to build large apartment for families .
But Lim Yew Soon , director-general of the real estate company El Developers , says that his `` shoe boxes '' to sell much faster than larger units .
They are so popular , and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units .
This means that they are much better for our cash flow .
He admits , however , that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines , which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small housing units in a project .
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state .
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate , is the discussions with the Singapurern working in the financial district , that they will not have a major impact .
`` The people are very stressed , housing and education are expensive , so it is by many , '' says a young manager .
The kids can get others .
`` It is important for me , to have my own money and time , '' says another , about twenty years old man .
Men and women their career , the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons for the fact that they have no children .
That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to children , because the government can do so much .

Apart from the different health warnings and images from next Saturday , is the only difference between the packs in the brand names , which are printed in identical , small letters .
Australia is the world 's most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging .
The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco consumption .
It is the government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke will start with 26 , with 99 % probability .
`` You can already see in children young age that they understand the message of tobacco companies trying to compete with their brand image , '' said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek . It cited studies that have shown , for example , that children associate the crown logo associated with the idea of a princess .
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will affect only slightly on the profits of the multinationals , other countries are considering similar steps .
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law .
It was said , with the laws of the black market trade , which would lead to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes .
`` The laws will lead to serious , unintended consequences , '' says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia .
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia .
Others , however , say that the laws have boosted their business .
Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd , a small family business , notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone covers for the companies to cover the unbearable packaging has , British American Tobacco , Britain 's Imperial Tobacco , Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago because of the Supreme Court with their appeal of the law .

The most difficult job in the world : the human Kawah Ijen
For four euros , the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they are 70 kilogram of sulphur on the steep , rocky paths .
There are people for whom their work is hell , and others work literally in hell .
This is the case with Anto Wijaya , one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java .
Every day he has to get down on the floor of the crater , where the earth , sulphurous gas in contact with the air .
He stones , which can weigh up to 70 pounds , he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths made of stone .
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano , which rises to a height of 2386 meters , but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace , the balance and they must put their steps carefully , so that they do not slip and fall .
They know that every step can cost their lives , as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen volcano .
The Kawah Ijen mine workers earn 5 cents for each kilogram of sulphur , which .
At the top , they pave the path between the tourists like circus monkeys and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales , a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and ( rather ) is exploiting its workers , which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees ( 5 euro cents ) for each kilogram of sulphur .
They then sold for 10,000 rupees ( 83 euro cents ) to the petrochemical industry , because this mineral is widely used in everyday life , and is used for the production of woods , fireworks , cosmetics , dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar .
`` We are usually 70 kg , we get around 46,000 rupees ( 3.8 euros ) , '' explains to us Anto , which makes three routes on the day .
For each track that he needed three hours , according to which he is completely , at the end of the day , but it has 138,000 rupees ( 11.5 euros ) .
What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort , but it is three times what he would earn with the field work .
`` The daily wage of mine workers here , where the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees ( 1.2 euros ) a day , and the average monthly income of two million rupees ( 167 euros ) , is very high , '' explains the winner , who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali .
There , he earned 75,000 rupees ( 6.2 euros ) a day , and the work was not so hard , but Anto is in Banyuwangi , a village nearby , returned with his family , and for a reason , which is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia : `` I have married a girl from Bali , where they are Hindus , and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam . ''
Anto has asthma , breathes with difficulty , often a coughing fit and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases .
The 27-year-old Anto puts his life at the Kawah Ijen volcano for three years on the , whose sulfur already left the first traces of him , although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses .
Anto has asthma , breathes with difficulty , often a coughing fit and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano .
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream .
`` I will work here two years ago , because I open a shop or to learn Spanish or French , '' he promises in a more than decent English .
This pleasant and intelligent , but young man life overregulated could work as a tourist guides , waiters or working on the reception desk of a hotel , but instead he carried out the work of a Tragesels .
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers , and every morning at two o'clock , because the sulphur applying at night , where his distinctive yellow color shines in the darkness .
The shadow challenging , in the light of a small forehead lamp on his helmet , which he bought from his own money into the crater .
About 400 winners are on the crater floor baskets with sulphur on their shoulders .
Despite their huge profits , the mining company has mechanized the sulphur reduction in order to save costs , and the work on their own account and are paid according to weight , no equipment .
You also get a share of 30,000 rupees ( 2.5 euros ) surcharge per camera , as well as the of this nature parks , together with the entrance fee of rupees ( 1.2 euros ) demand from the tourists who come to the shooting of the volcano and human .
`` This work is for the animals and not for the people '' protested Madrusin , a sturdy , which operates three decades since leaving the school at the Kawah Ijen volcano .
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he continues , `` as long as it is , '' because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18 years .
I will not retire , I will die here , because the volcano was my whole life .
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and eyes , when the wind suddenly and can become trapped mine workers in the thick pillars rising from the crater , the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course , the usual respiratory problems , arthritis , pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders , which by the weight of the baskets .
With the basket on his back is Unainik with his 53 years , only able to carry 50 kg .
Every day he and his companions 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano , which are carried by three trucks on a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away .
`` I am not going to retire , I will die here , because the volcano was my whole life , '' explains Unainik , where he opens his mouth wide , in which some teeth are missing .
From his five children , the oldest working with his 30 years as sulphur .
Time passes , but the poverty keeps generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world : those who work as human load donkey on the Kawah Ijen volcano .

The Old battles , new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
There will be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East ?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such a hope in The bud .
In the midst of the usual recriminations countless buildings were in rubble , more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem .
But , while the Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict , the Middle East is changing around them .
The Arab Spring has created a new , uncertain situation , and whether they like it or not , Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil .
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed .
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally end .
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance seems optimistic given the current situation is anything but .
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November , have strengthened the this week 's fighting the on both sides .
The leaders of Hamas , the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007 , to say that the Israelis have pushed back , although his group even suffered heavy losses .
Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and corners of the planet , Israel has so far , not to destroy Hamas .
Indeed , Hamas wins in the West Bank , which is controlled by the rival , moderate Palestinian group Fatah .
And Hamas leaders might come to the conclusion that they have time on their side .
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world , Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side .
Turkey , a , regional power , which was once known as Israel 's closest Muslim ally , Hamas has taken party - just like Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states .
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent , from Lebanon to the north , where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria , where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren embossing before Stürzung Bashar Assad could be up to Jordan , where Hamas allies threaten the king .
And , in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - by far the and most important Arab country , on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region .
Hosni Mubarak , the secular despot , who ruled Egypt until his fall 2011 30 years , had little time left for Hamas .
In contrast , the Brotherhood with Hamas and its leaders more dependent on people 's views .
In future diplomatic negotiations , Hamas could prove to be as a player that ca n't , even by Israel and the United States can not be excluded .
The Israeli hardliners , however , an opposite conclusion .
In military terms , Hamas is not a threat .
The Israeli missile defense system , `` Iron Dome , '' has been able to prove its worth , and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed .
At least for a while , Israel will be able to sleep .
In diplomatic terms , the United States hold their position . Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence .
Israel has in recent years , particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , who has been largely ignored the peace process .
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed about 30 Israelis since 2004 , the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the , which in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state , which protect the Jewish settlements that have been of international law , but always be developed further .
Netanyahu is doing well . His Likud party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with a group .
Why is this cunning Palestinians and left to their own state ?
If they had control of the West Bank , in fact , they would not like their colleagues in Gaza , fire rockets ?
No , it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish you , they should dare to raise their heads .
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to , But the Arab spring could make them .
Even if the Islamists , who are now in Egypt and other countries are in power , have little left for Israel , they will focus on the problems in their own country .
Israel 's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors .
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair its economy .
This pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama , in order to achieve a could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era .
The Israelis should think long-term .
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation , Palestinians are still deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg , which will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories , just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv .
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation .
Bloody missions to curb Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand increasingly over the years , its diplomatic toll .
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The right answer is that the one of the more reasonable representatives of both sides , most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper : two states , where Israel is for security purposes .
The for the near future small - hope is that the cease-fire gives outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution .
Egypt must stop now , together with Turkey and Qatar arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas to the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders , supplemented by the of and a common Jerusalem .
Outsiders Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement .
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for un observer status .
Obama also needs to do its part to push Israel to negotiate .
During his first term , he missed the idea of his own peace plan .
Far away in the White House , it seems as if he were also to participation .
But this is a sad , short-sighted perspective .
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians .

Palliative care - the best way to die .
With its Committee on `` death With dignity , '' Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of the end of life .
The debate has to be in The near future , although a bill is being prepared .
However , there is still much to do in this important area .
Le Devoir has tried to look at this .
A few weeks ago Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie .
The prostate cancer , which it aufzehrte , had left him a period of two years .
`` They gave me five years to live , I have seven years , '' he said half-heartedly , lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil , in which he arrived the previous day .
`` However , it is always a shock , it is not can be prepared , '' he says .
The disease makes his work : a huge weakness prevents him from going to the toilet and even to eat .
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch , he resigned , agrees with the help .
He even manages to smile and speak with strangers who are around him , give him his medication , and a bath .
The courage of ordinary death .
`` My biggest wish is that My diarrhea , as this is humiliating , '' he says .
A few hours later , the team has found a cure for this .
`` In the course of our lives , we learned that a man standing , '' says Pierre Brodeur , a psychologist at the home of .
In return , the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people .
`` It depends on the ability of the person '' to accept a retrograde step , he says .
Because , according to several people who work in the palliative care , big events take place in the midst of these setbacks .
The patients who are in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois , all suffering from cancer .
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months .
At this stage , they are by the doctors and nurses who care for them , with a so-called `` healing '' care .
For Mrs A. , 89 , is the worst fear , to die , `` and by suffocation . ''
But by the disease , I have my children really .
`` I have good children , '' she adds .
`` I have no longer in life , '' she says , before she accepts that she wears a mask that helps her breathe .
It expects in the next few days , despite a recent visit to her son , who is from Italy .
In the home Victor Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance In food intake .
The palliative care is used if there are no other options .
In order to make the deaths .
In Quebec , a bed for the palliative care .
This is very little , given that we will all die one day .
The life in the best possible conditions , said Dr. Christiane Martel , one of the doctors of the home .
Both at the level of the physical , emotional or spiritual comfort .
It grants the dying wishes , according to an oral care with brandy or Pepsi .
The diabetics to control their blood sugar levels .
And the death is part of everyday life .
Last night Mr X , we have a beer , who died in the course of the night .
This morning , his son will drink beer at the foot of the deceased .
`` We help family members and patients alike , '' says nursing director Nathalie Savard .
In the home Victor Gadbois is different every day .
In addition to an old man of 93 years , the last family gathering in the courtyard and is supported by his pillow , while his honor , a young man of 36 years , which is surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , tragically , after he has tried everything in order to survive .
`` For six months are three to five beds with cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years , '' says Dr. Christiane Martel worries .
53 % of patients admitted to the home Victor Gadbois come from their home , 47 % come from the hospital .
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77 % of Canadians do not have access to palliative care , to a care , which is to alleviate the suffering of patients , they have reached the final stage of their lives , both at home , in the hospital or in a nursing home .
And several organizations , such as the home of and the society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients .
It is this major shortcomings in the care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns .
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation , which has been signed by prominent figures of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative .
According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec the health system is not enough to ensure that all of the right to have a high-quality palliative care before accepting move to euthanasia .
Recently , she says , I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room , with its has taken measures to alleviate .
I am afraid that the patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care .
And at the same time , several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions hard until the last day .
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were minimal , as it has broken off a difficult chemotherapy .
When I told my oncologist that I will break the treatment , she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight , told them .
However , she had told me that I was at the end .
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 % of patients who have asked to die , the nursing staff , that it is not granted this wish , after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care .
But it must be said that the palliative care in pain treatment is not .
After Elsie Monereau , director of the palliative care of the society of domestic palliative care of Montreal 8 % of patients do not speak to a pain treatment .
At the very end the life of the doctors rely so often terminal sedation , which the patients either sporadically or permanently to the time of his death .
We can no longer act as if We do not perceive this side of the suffering .
Patients without pain relief will have the opportunity to the terminal sedation .
Patients whose pain is not all say the same sentence : `` I want to die . ''
But that does not necessarily mean , `` I want to put me , '' but `` I want to see my pain . ''
The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian health research Institute .

`` Brand protection '' in China : If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand , Polo Ralph Lauren .
But what is Armani Polo ?
It is a name officially registered in China , which has nothing to do with the original company .
However , as long as it is protection , such as the real name donors do not complain .
And even then it is not clear whether they get right .
`` It will become more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China , '' says Thomas in the law firm Taylor Wessing , , a lawyer who specializes in patent rights abuses in the Far East .
Every week , a new case ends up on my desk .
The are already a few extra letters , so that they can register their brands .
It is from Gucci , Prada is simply Lu Gucci , Prada .
German companies are legally copied in this way , such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma .
Standoff hole opens a folder with entries of the Office in Beijing .
On September 14 , 2010 , a Chinese company protecting the trademark Zegna DF Puma , an art , a name that the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna .
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in the copying and the injured intellectual property , is well known .
In the big cities , there are more-floor department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting .
, however , there are different : on behalf of its clients , it is the fact that Chinese companies receive officially by the Trademark Office for the right to use a term that is already protected elsewhere .
The Chinese call The `` bang Mingpai , '' a passenger brand .
The word is based on `` Bang Dakuan . ''
This means that women are fish rich men .
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt
`` It is , we must fight it , '' calls for the .
`` The brand is , the position disappears , the damage is enormous . ''
The financial losses and the legal costs of the affected industries are in the millions , especially in expensive flagship products .
According to the market research company CLSA is China , with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year , the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing .
But deletions of dubious entries in the register of are hard to reach and go into the money .
The process can drag on for Up to nine years , with an uncertain outcome .
Reports of cases in which the court rejected , because after the long duration of the name of the `` market reality . ''
If the plaintiff have bad luck , he would have to pay the Plagiator even money because he violated its brand in China , says stalemate hole .
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle .
Famous cases involving graphic elements .
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction equipment manufacturer Sany , a company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker .
The Chinese must use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star .
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo , which recalled BMW ; the dispute has been resolved , Geely had to change it .
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore , the famous crocodile in the other direction .
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt .
The Trademark Office in Beijing CTMO is that there have been 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages .
But Last year was one of the `` emergency position in the workflow returned to normal . ''
The fallen by 22 percent .
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed , 75 percent more than in the previous year .
However , in the office still 81,500 objections to completion .
On the other hand , to address costs a lot
As so often in China , the numbers are impressive .
Last year , the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection , almost a third more than in 2010 .
This is a record and meant that China , for the 10th time in the list of applications around the world , with the authority .
This also applies to the stock of all the valid trademarks , a total of 5.5 million units .
In 2011 , has taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees .
This means that any application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros .
On the other hand , to address costs many times , as the case of the German company Freudenberg .
For more than seven years , the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator .
While the Germans were able to achieve its illegal Fabrikation imitation of motor vehicle parts has been .
But the the Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg .
You have failed , because in Germany could not be protected , `` said Hanno Wentzler , the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical in Munich .
The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich as well .
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right , but the process .
We need to watch
Now , the matter is pending before the Supreme Court of Justice .
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion , and commends the professionalism of the courts .
But he also says : `` The process is extremely complex and is costing us a lot of time , money and nerves . ''
The internal costs could not quantify the company , even one hundred years old files to provide evidence .
Five years ago , Freudenberg , in a `` high six-figure euro amount '' on the other side of the settlement .
`` You can see how much it is worth , '' says Wentzler .
The dangers in the Far East , even in Europe .
Then , if there territory.What Doubles vulnerable brands .
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather .
This business , but the company has a long time , he was able to avert the registration .
`` You have to watch it , '' says Wentzler .
Both he and the lawyer advising German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China .
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights , the foreigners `` everything is somehow , in China , '' as Wentzler says .
Otherwise , this can be much more expensive than the registration .
In fact , if Freudenberg In the last act of his trademark drama , then you would have to pay the other side of fees for their own name , explains Wentzler .
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question .

- In an exhibition in the Palace of Culture , in my work .
I realised that I have to go down this path .
Then there was the time of the old free , but not officially recognised painter at the time , and new and free painters as I was incomprehensible .
I am with the painters of the new generation , with the representatives of the `` Gazonewschina '' ; it was a `` Pushkinskaya 10 , '' and then once was .
It takes me to the theatre , fashion , music , to everything , except the literature .
- And all the united in your kind clinic ... - it was important to me to be at the heart of the culture , where the best creative artists should meet .
In 1995 I occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10 , and there was up to the renovation a club for the Boheme , the house of the .
Many were born there : N.O.M. , Tequilajazzz , and I remember how cord with his project `` Ucho Van Goga '' visited it .
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback , wore tight shirts and was one of the composer Igor Wdowin today .
When the group began to play live , was from the `` Leningrad '' .
Mountain moderated many programs before the era of `` Halli Galli . ''
We gave them , and it began his great career , but he learned the basics .
Even the gallery `` D 137 '' or the club `` Griboedov '' have their origin in the hospital .
Our employees and guests .
I am a hero of the last century , as a culture still meant something .
In the year 2000 , there was a survey in the press , `` people of our city . ''
`` I won in the category of '' artist of the year , and so I had arrived at the peak .
It is not easy to work in new times , according to the old rules ; I am a man of truth , honesty and culture of the last century .
In this day and age , it is easy to be famous , but culture and popularity are not the same thing : you can be famous , without having to make a cultural contribution .
- Your work has a distinctive style .
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and make clear the timeliness and sharpness of thought .
I will have an exhibition with the theme `` the Russian Museum as a clown . ''
Clowns are timeless .
I was socially , but now it hurts and is to be so .
In a clown obliterated everything and loses his tragedy .
I love the grotesque , and I have bizarre ideas .
For example , we save the world by stipulating that everyone has to dress up .
Now everyone is the clothes and is based on the outside and not on the inside of the people .
But perhaps we should not be a human hand , but he should spit in the face .
The deception disappears through The .
Recently , we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player . - A cultural city should have a hero .
Who , if not I ?
- Commercial art can be beautiful ?
- Commercial art must be careful , thoughtful and flattering .
We see the disintegration of the cultures .
Large groups of people In the past : the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people .
Now there are micro communities , and it is difficult to please everyone .
I am not a one-hundred-dollar note each .
Now you have to think about whom you will like .
Now every cult star has about 100 followers .
- Come to the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand !
- Women abandoned him , the social sphere plays a role .
For cultural reasons , 300 people and not 10 thousand , so there is less management , money , and everything is .
I have followers , and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved .
In my youth , I have painted these pictures , which hung with a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow .
I started with images that are usually only at the end of the career .
Today , there are often misunderstandings .
It says : intellectual culture and consumer culture .
Consumption has no culture , that is something quite different .
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty , and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint .
This is the culture that I support .
- What is missing Kirill Petersburg ?
- Good cultural experts .
They say : Servant of the culture .
But not all of them can deal with culture .
In the real tsars , it was different , because the tsars did not a lot of culture , but they understood that right experts .
In Moscow , there are currently good advisers .
In St. Petersburg , we have what might be the experts , but they will be the way , as it requires hochrangigerer experts is that the former correctly assess and pave the way for them .
Now , only their own taste .
The same applies to the Erarta , but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must find other museums .
- What is for you ?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural Capital in Moscow , there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground .
On our stones art is difficult to grow up .
We need a cultural breeding ground because , for example , we now have more writers than readers , and that is not true .
In Europe , there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts .
We are much less .
Art must be back in fashion , as at the beginning of the last century .
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg

`` The people want me to save the Republic , but I am just an amateur , '' said Okamura .
Mr Senator , how to get the idea to run for the office of the president ?
It is not for me to be a senator or president .
If everything would work without any problems in our country , I would not be .
But I can no longer see the republic plundered for 20 years , as thieves walk free , while increasing people 's taxes and the retirement age .
I had no ambitions to become a politician .
But when I see something that I do not like , then I try to propose a solution to change this .
And while I am over 40 , and independent and party-less , I have no other way to influence things , to stand as a candidate for the office of a senator or president .
In the Senate , you have done it , and then on the road to the castle .
You do not turn your constituents ?
I said to have the whole time that I will take up the fight for the castle on the outcome of the elections .
Later , I have this and said that I will stand as a candidate for the office of the President , if I am elected senator .
My goal is not the function of the function is an instrument with which I realized My vision .
I need as much influence and a strong mandate .
The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television , but anyone who wants to make a difference .
There are the media who want to rob the , and the freedom of speech with the freedom to confuse .
For me , For example , it was said that I would impress journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek .
We are talking about your vision .
The battle for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations about 20 million crowns .
You have to change laws .
As president , you have no powers in this regard , and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals .
How do you solve this problem ?
As a simple citizen , I have to the fact that the travel guide remains a free trade , and this could be enforced .
The problem is the petty politics - if someone from the right or the left comes with a good proposal , that it is rejected , and that keeps the population .
As an independent party , I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in Parliament .
My advantage is that I without drawers thinking and party dogma of each party can take what is best for our country .
Do you see yourself as a man in politics , rather than on the right or left ?
From the Czech point of view , it seems to me that people see more on the left .
This thinking , but it is completely irrelevant .
For me , it is important that we move forward .
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or the right , I would like to connect people .
I am always publicly any good solution , even if this comes from the or ODS , and I will against bad ideas .
It bothers you , if someone described you as populists .
But you do not , what you just said ?
If you are in a company set up a business plan , then you have an ideal destination and a vision .
And you would like to this .
This as populism , but all the proposals , of which I have spoken to function in the world , or they have been discussed by important experts .
But without support in Parliament , you are only key words .
And so that you are not in politics in the long term .
Or do you think that you , if you talk long enough with the people will be able to enforce , for example , the material and criminal liability ?
I have no other option .
Politicians , journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them on our side , to , in order to achieve these goals .
As president , it would be no problem for me , the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to the material and criminal liability for politicians , civil servants , judges and prosecutors .
And then , the would have to say why they oppose it .
A strong personality , which refers to grievances , can put pressure on the political scene .
Take the direct election of the president , who was a credit to the public pressure .
I say very clearly that I am an amateur , and I am neither a genius nor an intellectual .
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions .
I started with the policy , and just trying to find my program for the support of the majority .
I always try to assess the situation , and if it does n't work , then I go back in six years in the private sector .
That sounds a little , as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic .
I am not a savior .
I know that I am not alone ; that is why I have spoken with several well-known personalities , whether they do not want to run for the Senate .
I spoke with Radim Janura , for example , but because of work .
I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová , who exposed the fraud in the light fuel oil .
My candidacy , I started with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy , but now I am no longer sure .
Sixty percent of the eligible voters have not gone to the elections , and those who are mostly elected representatives of the establishment .
In the Senate , we are only two independents .
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement .
Nevertheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of mayors and county .
Do you think about setting up your own party ?
I have not thought about it , because I do n't have the time to review the past any potential party member , and do not have the money for it .
I have no money for the presidential campaign , on my transparent account only 20,000 CZK .
They have no money ?
You talk about asset declarations , what would your ?
I value my private assets to about 60 million .
In Prague , I have a property with a value of 25 million , an apartment for about 10 million , another for 8 million , an art collection , which is worth about 10 million , as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb , which is worth about one million . And then I still have a few million In the bank account .
I always liked the a childhood dream - James Bond 's Aston Martin was , as he was driving in the car , to women , and at the same time fighting against evil .
You are driving an Aston Martin , have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign ?
They say that you want to change the republic , but you do n't want to invest your own money in it .
That is not very convincing .
I do not have 15 million for the campaign .
Should I do about debt ?
I have already spent 2.5 million into the campaign .
The fact that I have no sponsors , shows that my program is probably not too much interest .
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources .
The cost of the campaign are in fact covered by my salary as a senator .
But the senators salary , I could not live alone ; for example , my son , I could not finance the English school , which costs 30,000 per month .
If I just wanted to make money , I would stand for nothing at all .
So , as an entrepreneur , in order to have your livelihood ?
You said that you will go back these activities ?
But that does not depend on the level of the salary .
As promised , I have reduced my activities .
My deputy in the spring , managing director of the travel agencies .
The People want to see me as a Samaritan , saving the republic .
But I have to live on .
In which The monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur ?
About 200,000 to 400,000 , and that is the case .
As president , I would , however .

After the court of appeal of the United States confirmed a ruling that does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of the group of Vitro , which has been achieved by a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico , a sinister precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country , which has payment problems .
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes in contravention of international agreements have no validity .
In practice on 15 June recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale on the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas , the Mexican companies are subject to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo .
However , the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico , the door to call for three inconsistencies of the Supreme Court of the United States .
While the judge of the matter that lenders must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States , says the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans , first , that the is the main proceedings for the trade in Mexico .
The first point would mean that international cooperation in the event of companies with trans-national profile is not known .
In fact , was created to this end , the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law , with the American law Institute was used as a mediator .
Secondly , the ruling determined that without the votes of the companies for recognition of the in the bankrupt estate the branches of Vitro , with its parent company , the majority needed for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have achieved .
However , this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws .
In fact , Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved .
There are half a dozen examples , including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana , whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles ( Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies ) were confirmed by .
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the voices of the branches of the creditors of Vitro , the creditors , who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro , the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital , Aurelios Convergencia , Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited , had , would not have a majority .
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent .
This is not taken into account by the court of appeal .
On the other hand , there is Vitro debt for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the economic crisis in the United States , which has been in the country .
For this reason , the family González Sada before the same court of appeal , so that the vote takes place in the house , by all the judges , because only three of them .
It is not the , which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority , in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States .
The most serious in this case is that the court had a document , which was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura an amicus curiae ( friend of the court ) , where the procedure by Vitro is described in the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies , and that is pointed out that it had to the agreement signed by both countries to respond to Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States .
It is also pointed out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade , that the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border insolvency , which guarantees equality of debtors and creditors .
Zweibandige Karambole : a blow for Vitro and for the country .
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican unions for air traffic from former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade , who is accused of fraudulent administration , several months , the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores ( Federation of trade unions of the pilots ) finally made progress .
The inquiry led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau now has a criminal case against the national bank and Securities Commission , which is accused of obstruction of justice .
After that , the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the headquarters of the Republic on a transaction carried out by the to withdraw from the trustee account F / 589 on the name of the bank IXE Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos .
These funds were used for the purchase of shares of Administradora Profesional de Hoteles ( the professional hotel management ) .
As you know , Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas .
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting at the weekend on a forum at the University of the Caribbean have a group of national and foreign environmentalists , academics , businessmen and members of civil society , the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún .
As you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country on the other side of the wall , supplemented by a living area for the staff of 150 companies .
In the run-up to the ( the national chamber of manufacturing ) to the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental establishment , which has been partly protected areas and the mother of all threats to the industry .
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances of the Mexican ambassador to Japan , signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , which is known by the English acronym ACTA , did not , the matter has already been filed in accordance with the Mexican Institute for intellectual property has already .
As you know , these measures , even though the Senate had the opportunity to , because he saw it As a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks .
In the long term Homex long-term
In the quest to pay long-term liabilities without affecting the short-term liabilities , the construction company Homex stock certificates over 500 million pesos on the market .
The emission is the first of four equal emissions that promise an interest payment every 28 days .

The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head by the example of Spijkenisse , and the mountain - 2 photos
`` I find the building fun , it looks futuristic , and finally , there is something interesting to see again , '' said Lisette Verhaig , a Passantin at the .
And Stefan Spermon , it technicians in a nearby wholesale company , says : `` But it is nice , the house . ''
But I wonder why we still need a library .
All have Internet , iPad and e-books .
No one is still voluntarily in one of these old style libraries , right ?
Spijkenisse , a little town on the outskirts of Rotterdam , is outlandish record holder .
The has the lowest rate of education throughout the Netherlands .
In order to counteract this stupid thing , it was decided a few years ago to contribute to the general education and the seven fictional bridges that are on the euro , as a reinforced concrete miniatures .
The success of the education offensive was .
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way to the statistics : a library .
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV , master of bar charts and producer of funny , often cynical buildings , took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared to the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on his face .
And while the jury looked nonplussed , and his exquisite souvenirs of the size of the cheeky Maas , a pyramid and ended his speech with the words : `` Love . ''
This is it , my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse , for the so-called Boekenberg !
Nine years later , the 30 million euros is expensive .
It is part of a revitalization project , which includes underground car park , supermarket , post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments .
At the beginning of November , the books with the second prize `` Best Library of NL 2012 . ''
In addition , the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 .
It is the faceless city retort , which until now had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall , the white facades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory , a piece of contemporary architecture .
But above all , Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural 's in the history of its existence .
The long road to The book
The first impression : books under glass .
There is a lift , through the hills , but the real and reading room at the nearby climbing the topography .
The glazed interior is bright and clear , the and the elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square .
The urban environment is perfect .
It is already looking for park bench , dog and football playing boys and girls .
And everywhere , books , books , books .
`` Normally the bookshelves along the facade , and is in the middle of a large , dark room , which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal , '' says Winy Maas .
We have the classic room configuration on the head and the reading area from the inside out .
The interior of the book mountain is cleverly used : in the middle are offices , Internet library , chess club , environmental centre and .
A special pleasure is the black bookshelves , which are sometimes wall panelling , , .
Look , feel and smell are foreign .
Even die-hard architects and engineers shake of the unknown building .
`` We wanted to work with recycled materials , '' said Joop Trouborst , project manager at the Spijkenisse , at the request of the standard .
And so we are in a friesländischen agricultural operation on a suitable waste product from agriculture .
For many years in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a as root .
That is cheap and efficient .
The thin textile holds one or two seasons , then it is ready for The rubbish bins .
For the library was pressed the fleece - for the first time in this to four centimetres thick plates .
Under heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic ( KLP ) to a dark , homogeneous , material , which smells a little for new cars and a little after .
After 105 stages has reached the summit .
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also rewarded with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen .
They provide for atmosphere , but especially for the right humidity in literature .
Donations for the new soul
`` You would not believe it , but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces , a flagship project in terms of ecology , '' says .
It Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy .
Although the book mountain is under a glass of , the sun shines , even on sunny days only briefly in the interior .
The broad , on the glass facade , and a large part of the sun .
The room climate is very pleasant .
Do the rest fully automatic blinds .
Stefan Spermon , the initial skeptics from the IT industry , already the way to the new library .
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there .
And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde , the Boekenberg Spijkenisses `` long overdue soul . ''
The reason : The opening of a few weeks ago , everyone was invited residents to donate a book from his personal collection .
For the time being , the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces - This is to be filled .
The concept is .
The shelves are filled up .
`` Nothing is worse than a half-empty library , '' says architect Winy Maas .
`` I think our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship with this new house .
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building .
And if it is only .
This is a MVRDV discipline was called in the jargon identity .
Spijkenisse wrote literary history .
So young and uneducated they may be .
This is a starting point for identity .

Poland and the space .
Last week , Poland was as a member of the European Space Agency at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member states of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc ( after the Czech Republic , which took place on 12 November 2008 ESA member ) .
Poland began in 1994 close cooperation with the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and took part in the following years several ESA projects .
The path of Poland into space , however , began much earlier .
Even before the Second World War Polish space in the space , and they do not always met with understanding .
I would remind you of the lecture by A. Šternfeld 6 December 1933 in Warsaw , for example , in which the author thought from his pioneering work `` entrance to the Outer Space Exploration . ''
The ideas of the young engineer ( born 1905 ) , the audience cold , and after years ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work .
Šternfeld won in 1934 for `` entrance to the Outer Space Exploration '' by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix .
Dr. Jan Gadomski ( 1899 - 1966 ) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel .
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines .
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been by , among other things , that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him .
In the year 1925 in Poland , a railway trolley was built , a rocket was planned .
The author of the draft and the details of this project , unfortunately , remained unknown .
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or the brakes of the trolley .
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press .
In 1933 , the Polish infantry began to deal with .
The research , the Institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi .
It is clear From the documents show that the research was to the stage of practical tests .
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht .
In 1937 , appeared in the press of the draft photoelectric hunting rocket , and the following year , the `` Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza '' of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky .
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion .
Shortly before the war , all the projects for the military use of missile technology from the scientific advisory committee ( Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy ) .
The committee was established in 1937 , after two years of work by his work was the beginning of the war .
Another article on space after the war , thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrt ( Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne ) in the Polish press .
The first mention of this company 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy , in which four major articles devoted to the space travel .
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains The proposal to set up a space company .
At the time , there were already the first projects to satellite technology , and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future .
At its inception in 1956 , the PTA Polish aerospace company founded in 1951 to join the International Federation for space , and indeed , in the autumn of 1956 , the PTA was already .
In the following year became the first PTA chairman , Kazimierz Zarankiewicz ( 1902 - 1959 ) , Deputy chairman of the International Federation for space travel .
The office he held until his death in 1959 .
Since 1956 , the PTA took part in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket ( Rakieta Meteorologiczna ) , the first Polish missile for scientific research .
The first type , the RM-1 , was completed in 1957 , the first launch took place on October 10 , 1958 .
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg .
Later , an improved version , the RM-1A , built , and 1959 in the bledowska desert flight tests began with the two-stage rocket .
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed about 11.5 kg .
A further stage of development should be able to provide real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and come for the observation of high-altitude winds .
In 1962 , but the development has been .
Successor to the first missiles of the type RM was developed in the years 1962 to 1965 .
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket , its total length was 510 cm and The weight was 32.5 kg .
This has developed three types ( Meteor-1A , -1B and -1C ) , which are from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments .
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport area with 0.4 litres , Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and 0.62 litres .
The maximum altitude of all three types of 37 km .
In the years 1965 to 1968 , was developed in the aviation institute , whose first flight tests began in October 1970 .
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg , at a height of about 60 km .
The versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built .
It is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1960 , after two years later , followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee .
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in the space research with Soviet satellites , and in 1978 , the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second .

World Aids Day : , singing , help
In the chorus Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are happy about it .
The story of a connection that is more than 8733 kilometers .
First there is the : cowboy boots , basketball shoes , ladies and on the parquet floor looking for the , find it quickly .
One two three four .
Only then it shrinks the voices of the singers , slowly - Alt , bass , tenor and soprano - and press .
And Fiete Hopf , the 29-year-old conductor , it almost from its plastic shoes when he brings together with his sleek wild gestures .
It is Monday night in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg , in the chorus Imbongi a new song .
The fifty singers came between 23 and 69 years old , from the Human Genetics , up to the house .
`` Om '' Obani `` is not a simple piece , each choir voice has a different text and even in a foreign language : Zulu , which is spoken of eleven million people in South Africa , Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mozambique and parts of Swaziland .
Self-help
Worldwide there are about 34 million people infected with HIV , the estimates Unaids , the United Nations for the Bekämfung of AIDS .
23.5 million people live in southern Africa .
In Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans .
More than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive .
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni has found the association Voices for Africa godfather in Germany .
70 of them attend secondary school .
For 15 or 20 euros per month , you can take a sponsorship .
It guarantees the child school fees , school uniform and a hot meal every day in the Gogo Center .
Imbongi means on Zulu storyteller or Lobpreiser .
The Bantu language fluently speak no one in this room , but sing .
For nearly ten years , the chorus songs in this strange soft language and brings it every now and then , back to where they originally come from : in the South Africa .
Because 8,733 kilometers away from Heidelberg , in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland , there is the village of Esitjeni that depends on the voting power of the German choir .
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there , some still in simple mud and straw huts , a large proportion of them are children .
More than 300 of them have no parents , because they have succumbed to the HI virus .
In Esitjeni small , Swaziland suffers : the highest HIV infection rate , lowest life expectancy in the world , according to UNICEF .
On the male foreskin , which has been shown to reduce the risk of contagion by half , will be accepted by the population .
More than 40 percent of the people of Swaziland the immunodeficiency virus to die in the middle of thirty is not uncommon .
In a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005 , the choir discovered the village , but above all , the Imbongis saw many children on the streets , which not only a lack of parental care , but simply of everything : food , clothing , education .
Without education there is no chance in a poor country , .
Initially , it was still a private involvement of individuals , for a few euros per year to send a child to school and to make him a hot meal a day .
But a year later , the choir founded the association `` Voices for Africa , '' which almost professionally since the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni .
Facts about sexually transmitted infections .
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases ?
The bacterial STI syphilis , chlamydia and Tripper ( Gonorrhö ) .
Frequent viral STI HIV , human Pappilomaviren , herpes genitalis or hepatitis .
The parasitic lice and itch Felt .
Who are the main groups ?
Syphilis and Tripper are in men who have sex with men .
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases in Germany reported to be transmitted through sexual contact between men .
Among the heterosexual adults chlamydia infections , Trichomonaden , Candidose ( mushroom ) , Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren common sexually transmitted diseases .
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively small - yet : accounts for about 20 percent of HIV infections in this group .
Chlamydia infections among young people are much more frequent than other groups .
According to European surveys , three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 years .
In this country are also humane Pappilomaviren among young people often .
As the number of infections has developed ?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable .
The number of syphilis infections has more than doubled , according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 illnesses in 2011 .
The number of new HIV infections since 2007 .
In 2011 , there were 2700 cases .
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year .
What are the symptoms related to a sexually transmitted disease ?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in The genital area , complaints when I urinated , discharge , pain and blisters or warts .
They often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed .
How can you protect yourself ?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection , but does not offer complete protection .
As part of the sexually transmitted diseases can be infections and close physical contact .
As a result , experts recommend changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups .
Diagnosed early most STI cured and can be avoided .
Through sponsorships , donations and not least , the fee , the choir in Germany ersingt , , .
`` We have sent around 200 000 euros after Esitjeni , '' says Annette Lennartz , the chairman of the association .
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini , a confident and assertive woman , the money from Germany .
It also takes care of the orphans staying well , one of the grandmothers .
The Gogos , as it is called the old women in Zulu , are the mainstays of the village .
Some of them have up to 14 orphans , give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms every day to the .
Anyone who has not , the house of Khanyisile , a single woman , which is paid by the club as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children .
In addition , `` Voices for Africa '' a sewing school , built two chicken houses and organised in conjunction with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have an HIV test .
This is not a matter of course , because the disease across the country is so obviously , it is silent on the dead .
A king with 14 wives
`` AIDS is an absolute taboo , '' says Annette Lennartz , `` because it has to do with sexuality . ''
Strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives .
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa , King Mswati III , who is known for his excessive lifestyle .
Polygamy instead of democracy .
Among other things , it also sanctioned by the state is due to the HIV spread so rapidly over the past decades .
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country .
Free condoms , there would be on every corner , says Annette Lennartz , `` but rarely used .
The culture is different - flesh to flesh. ``
In order to promote the cultural exchange , the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years together through the South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia , fighting spirit , confidence and black self-confidence , which many on the southern tip of the black continent still In times of apartheid .
A bus full of white , singing the songs in a black language - so much recognition not only mood and joy , but also has some fierce border guards a few tears .
The journey continues to Esitjeni , where The singers visit their children .
Even if the small village on maps , in the valley of the river , it is more than .
`` To Esitjeni , there is the light , '' says the people there .
And if you return to the 8733 miles as the crow flies to Heidelberg , pounding singers in the rehearsal room at the Bergheimer road , then you can see it .

Guidelines for the balloons , bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com , an annual survey on the oddest of bank charges , this year , has decided to hold the `` most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop . ''
`` This idea brought us the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a quota of 40 % in the management of large European companies , '' said Patrik Nacher , who cares about the organisation of this survey , told the newspaper Právo .
Among the nominated absurdities , for example , the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women .
Until then , women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance , because they are objectively less of a risk for the insurance companies .
`` More incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year .
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013 , `` said Nacher .
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol belongs to fuel , which is in its aftermath , the ban on the mercury thermometer , just because they a relatively small amount of this , or the directive on size of chicken cages , because of the eggs this year were much more expensive .
The criticism in the past , the de facto ban on the use of the term `` butter '' or even the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs .
Bananas must be 14 cm
The EU machine , often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry , whose demands are represented in the rule of one or more member countries in Brussels ( Czech Republic is currently trying example , to do with veto threat to the demands of Czech banks ) .
Lobbying interests were also behind it , that bananas of the highest trade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and no `` of . ''
The European Commission defended with the argument that it is only the fragmented national standards that would impede trade .
The standards for fruit and vegetables by the EU against the resistance of some countries already have been softened by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food .
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year , which according to balloons in the sale must be with that children under eight years of the balloon without the supervision of an adult .
The EU , citing an American study , which are in accordance with balloons in the is the leading cause of children .
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten .
There are also curious incursions at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that the European officials - anyone who has an official role in the EU , , which use the name Macedonia , because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead FYROM ( Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez faire nominated in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities , in the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies to the territory of a member country .
The EU has set the maximum volume of food supplies , which is on the day of our accession to the EU membership in the Czech Republic .
The Czech Republic , for example , exceeded The volume of canned mushrooms , for which threatened a large fine .
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them that they do not have a sea , or from the idea to provide funding for applications for funding .
These ideas , however , did not come from Brussels , but from Prague .
`` We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea .
We will be asking for a refund from the EU , `` said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas ( ČSSD ) in the autumn of 2004 .
The argument that the grain harvest was very high , and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases were overcrowded government camps .
The Czech Republic has another way to sea ports , the EU should pay according to Palas hundreds of millions of euros .
The European Commission , the Czech Republic , so that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea .
Funding for applications for grants offered communities the Ministry of Regional Development , headed by Minister Pavel Němec ( US-DEU ) , specifically for the establishment of aid money should be funding requests to Brussels .
EU : bizarre regulations are the exception
The target of criticism , the EU 's efforts to regulate and , hence , effectiveness and the development of the entire European Union , according to some experts , however , more recognition in the member States .
A serious problem , according to these experts are more EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in with the deepening of European integration , which were in the budget negotiations by individual member states .
Emotions that the fact that the Czech Republic must fight like other member countries in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win in this country .
The Czech Republic could to after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria , the term `` Olomoucké tvarůžky '' defend the local rum ( Tuzemský rum ) , whose tradition with us in the 19th century , but had to change our manufacturers , `` Tuzemák '' .
The name rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate , not for products made from sugar beet .
In the official list of registered products in the EU in the company of the feta cheese , Gorgonzola , Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham biscuits , carp from Pohořelice and and now , or even the Žatec hops .
With an can boast the gingerbread or Hořicer roles .

My Mexican-American identity crisis .
Due to the lack of opportunities , Many people are forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times in the memory , he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City , I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control as disturbing to me .
Signs pointed to two queues , one for `` Mexicanos '' ( `` Mexicans '' ) , another for `` Extranjeros '' ( `` aliens '' ) .
I stood there for a few seconds long , uncertain , which I should go .
I grew up in central California and has been all my life , `` Mexicans . ''
An ethnic symbol - just as my friends in Boston `` Irish '' or my friends in New York `` Italians . ''
Later , I opted for `` Mexican '' . ``
But this was Mexico .
And in the home of my grandfather , there was no need for shortcuts or .
I was just Americans .
I speak Spanish , or at least good enough to talk in this language on both ends of an interview .
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers , and my American accent , I will not go well .
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros .
I thought about that moment this week , when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
On the agenda of all those issues that , if the heads of the two countries : immigration , drugs and trade .
Pena Nieto was also very interested to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy . It is one reason that Mexicans remain today , with a high probability in Mexico , rather than emigrate to the United States .
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada , and to create a North American trade bloc after the European Union .
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico , even though he gave no details .
Mexico 's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment .
Most Americans probably never waste a single idea that the United States invaded in Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun forced to leave them more than half of its territory .
But for Mexicans , who in centuries , not in minutes , are not the memories of this event .
, as soon as a U.S. government official only mildest criticism in Mexico - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans , the sovereignty of their neighbour .
And the children of on the war path .
And yet the biggest challenge in Mexico is in fact , in the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States .
Want to talk about resentment ?
There are more than enough .
Mexico has winners and losers . People for whom the country offers opportunities , and others , for whom it does not do this .
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoenix , Denver or San Antonio , is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - no chance in Mexico , and in the north .
And in most cases , this person was a profile - dark-skinned , uneducated , from a poor village , etc .
We are the descendants of these people , and our loyalty is to them .
Not Mexico .
And although we may have to live the American dream , good schools and good jobs , we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican .
Our identity is blurred , perhaps , but when it comes to our loyalty , this is not the case .
This is certainly in the United States .
In addition , we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class .
This is based on reciprocity .
They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look down on us , because we are not Mexican enough .
Our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties with Mexico never strong enough .
They say that our existence is a symbol of failure .
If not our families in Mexico have failed , they would not have gone .
And then we would not be caught behind the silk curtain now - with a comfortable life in the United States , but somehow lost .
My wife , who was born in Guadalajara and legally as a child in the United States , reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans , because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them .
While it is a US citizen , sees herself as part of the two countries .
But many Mexican Americans , who I know , on the not on the other country .
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte , but also Bruce Springsteen .
It enjoys the best of both worlds , but is rooted in any one of them .
In Mexico , we are seen as Americans .
And in the United States , we are seen as Mexicans .
I should learn during my trip , there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated : some Mexican leaders and parts of the education and to to the diaspora .
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional `` ambassador '' for Mexico , who represent their interests in the United States .
We should tell our American colleagues , how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico .
Now .
This will not happen .
Too many hurt feelings .
And given the unequal income distribution , rampant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country .
I am afraid you alone , Amigos .
That is fair .
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to the United States for dealing with Mexico , a century and a half ago , they must also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for their family members were not so long ago .
Hmmm .
Perhaps we are `` Mexican '' than I thought .

Héctor `` Hetin '' Reyes : `` basketball was my life . ''
The organization of the basketball , Héctor `` Hetin '' Reyes , who was connected to the for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world .
Few in Puerto Rico have a great intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country such as Héctor `` Hetin '' Reyes .
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair , was Rexes part of this sport for 6 years , as a player and manager in the lower classes , players of the first national League , agent BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of basketball Association .
`` My whole life I have many hats in basketball , even several at the same time , when I was president of the BSN , managing director of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s , '' Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón , where he lives with Isabel , his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago .
`` Basketball was my life . ''
Reyes not exaggerating with this statement .
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and almost all of them .
Bayamón in the heart
The emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the centre of the 1950s as a player until 1982 , where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as a manager or of the club .
`` These were my best years I have enjoyed the most , because I was part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a managing director , has been further or coach .
There were many rewarding years , including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975 .
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981 , the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy BSN .
From then took over , `` Cuco '' Ortiz , who was a very good manager , `` said Reyes .
I know that I am Gene Bartow , who was here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , said : `` I have a very strong and 2 m great players .
Do you want it ? ``
And that was the beginning of Mincy , one of the best players who had Puerto Rico .
Bartow recommended that the free throw Proffesionals Raymond Gausse , and was one of our best shooter .
I remember how he said that if Mincy had made a championship for Bayamon , Gausse for another .
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him , but even from a distance , because he was already 1988 at the top of the association .
At that time , he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team .
I remember when we won for the first time in vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States .
Then came the World Cup in 1990 , in which we the fourth place , what should have been bronze , if not the Canadian referee had been the last game for the second time , Reyes said .
This group was the 1990 World Cup , the best national team you have ever seen ?
It is one of the best , as well as those who the that won 2004 Olympics against the Dream team .
My favorite is the team the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba , where we won gold and the team of the United States offered a fight , as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze .
When the team were not only Mincy , Gausse , Ramon Rivas , Fico López and `` Piculín '' ( Ortiz ) , but also the young players ( Javier ) `` Toñito '' Colón and James Carter , the brothers León ( Francisco and Edgar ) and Mario `` Quijote '' Morales , who could not be 1990 because of a knee injury .
A team that was perhaps in terms of personalities , not the best , but we won a gold medal and was a great pleasure to those of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén , Argentina .
With players such as `` Canito '' Nieves , Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata , we won against all the gold medal .
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico ?
There was no doubt Piculín Ortiz .
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive .
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín .
And this without taking account of his career in the various leagues , in which he has played .
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico ?
This is a difficult question .
We have had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro , Flor Meléndez , Carlos Morales , Raymond Dalmau , Armandito Torres .
The boys I like the work of Leo Arill well .
What do you think is the best , What you have achieved in the association ?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 , which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s , up to 17 teams in one season .
What remains to be done to you ?
There are things that I would have been introduced , such as the regionalisation of the lower categories .
That the guys in Ponce , for example , only in their area and only in the national playoffs teams from other corners of the island .
Today , the children of many unnecessary trips and games .
At least I can see the result of mandatory training and courses for coaches , officials and referees .
I am proud of that .
What do you do ?
I like to listen to music , watch videos , music of my time in YouTube , enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game .
And , of course , I enjoy the company of my wife , Isabel , who was always by my side .
