But while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs team with real Ibrahimovics missed chances before the goal . He was replaced later in the game against his hometown team , and against the club with whom he started his illustre career back in 1999 .
`` It is not easy to win at home or abroad '' in the course of the season in the Champions League , so it is a good start zurückzublicken , 2 : 0 to cause problems and relax our opponents to win , even if there are certain things that we still have to perfektionieren , Blanc said .

But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , who passed away on Kevin Trapps posts in the minute 34. offered little in attack .
Instead , PSG were themselves at times , with some false passports and bad accounts , not least from that patzte in no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart .
Yet he bewies much more skill when he brought his players into the game , and it was a pass from that Di Maria turned in a spin shot by Wiland 52. minute was over drawn on posts ...
The second goal finally came down shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani . The Uruguayer had reached for his sixth Saisontor after fischt that a left flank of Maxwell .
That ended any thought that Malmö could come back into the game , and only a hervorragendes intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz Endergebnis could keep low , before substitute player was imprisoned Lavezzi aberkannt a gate at the end .
The Malmö coach Age Hareide , were later to that PSG played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : `` Our last Champions League game was in December last year .
Since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which is not the same level .
The qualifying games are not enough. ``

That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate increase is coming , and the Hausse will get upset that bond yields will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
We know that .
What we do not know how long that takes and how long it will last .
In particular , the story offers little guidance to the end for the economy .
A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months .
The Aggressivität the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , but not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems respond .
Therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather on the period that is required for the normalization .
In fact , several variables play a role .
In the end , market participants might say , however , that all the excitement was probably exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates .
`` The Fed 's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of '' cheap money `` , '' said Julian Jessop , chief economist at Capital Economics , in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the allmähliche US interest rates return to normal levels , but still too low level for Seis mix shock many seem to fear to lead .
This does not , however , mean that there will be no impact .
Here is a look basierender on historical trends , as some areas of the economy might respond :
As the market has seen in the last month , the advance payment can make things of interest rate increases volatil for a while .
As soon as the increase eintrifft , the impact is not so dramatic .
`` Apparently , there is a tendency that asset returns are abgewürgt 12 to 24 months after the first hike , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , '' said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens to interest rate increases by the Fed .
More specifically , the market is usually in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates , relatively flat in the 250 days after that ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with a durchschnittlichen returns in the past six past Zyklen 14,4 percent according to a recent analysis , Bob Doll , chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , published in Barron 's .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle of increase and the yield that begins to reduce .
Rezessionen are a fact of business life , but they often promote interest rate increases .
In the current case , the Fed is faced with a number of conditions that did not exist before and which could hasten a recession .
Most remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed .
According to Deutsche Bank nominale GDP was at 118 rate increases since 1950 only twice under 4.5 percent .
Although the second was 3.6 percent of 2015 , few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed .
Interest rate increases in such a fragilen economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of `` whether it is different this time , '' Deutsche Bank said .
Market participants throughout the year to a rate increase by the Fed have been taken , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many Strategen and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session , the futures trading is only a 25 percent chance .
`` In our study have all increased Zyklen from 1950 to today put in place and pre-recession GDP levels very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade in a super cycle with increasing momentum , '' says the report .
In contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
The current cycle is by far the longest , the Fed has maintained since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
The fixed income was also volatil , because the market is anticipating a rate increase , and quite similar to the pattern as on the capital market .
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in equities , if the change their strategic course .
With bond yields seem to change direction , once the first increase / decrease in the cycle .
At the end of the cycle of increasing the bond yields fall immediately , Deutsche Bank said .
Strategen by Charles Schwab believes that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds back closer together and lead to Abflachung curve .
High verzinsliche bonds often bring better returns in such a climate , although `` we are still cautious , higher yields to be expected , '' said Kathy Jones , Fixed Income Analystin at Schwab , in an analysis .
Interesting , Jones says , is that the markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of Inflationserwartungen there are few signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has been adjusted , '' they wrote .
Short term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flacher credit spannen have extended their strategy and the volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market , when the Fed tightened .
By and large companies that the greater part of their Geschäftstätigkeit abwickeln in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products more attractive .
Multinationale companies with high debt will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , and also the financing of its debt .
`` History shows that '' Qualitäts- `` shares tend to respond very positively , '' Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report three months after an initial rate increase for customers .
Companies with strong balance übertroffen companies with weak balance after each of interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , on average , by 5 percentage points .
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 percentage points ( percentage points ) and 3 ( each ) .
Debt is a major problem .
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Goldman said .
Outside of pure stock games will benefit consumers by the rising dollar also .
Savers could see profits through higher yields , even though experts have different views of how quickly that will take place .

In some products such as televisions and washing machines will be carried out more than a third of purchases now on web Shops .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .

EU wants to double mercury limit in prey fish
The European Commission wants to double the Grenzwerte for mercury in large predatory fish and the Verbrauchern zumuten a much higher dose of the nerve 's gifts .
The consumer organisation Food Watch before a working paper of the EU , sharply criticized the plans : `` The risks and side effects verfehlter industrial and food Watch Umweltpolitik passed with full force to pregnant women and young children , '' said Matthias Wolf Schmidt .

Large predatory fish are tainted with mercury but already so strong that about 50 percent of the Fänge must not be sold on the basis of the current Grenzwerte .
After doubling the Grenzwerte then just 14.5 percent would not käuflich .
The EU in return for the easing will exacerbate Grenzwerte according to watch the food at other grams of fish from the current 0.5 milliseconds to 0.1 millimeter of mercury per kilogram .
Food Watch described this as a `` trick '' because small peaceful fish such as carp are most impacted so low that they comply with the planned Höchstwerte today .
The reduction in small fish is therefore `` a perfides diversion , which helps the economy alone , '' said Wolf Schmidt .
A high for people giftiges heavy metal mercury anreichert Nahrungskette is particularly strong in predatory fish .
The federal government warns so that `` even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system especially in Ungeborenen . ''
The Federal Ministry for world explains on its website regarding the current Höchstwerte but that was `` not to expect a '' health risks to the general population .
Mercury come mainly through coal Verbrennung in the environment .
The German coal plants run according to a written information of the Federal Ministry for world to the Greens federal MP Anna Lena Baer emittierten Bock in Germany more than six tons of mercury a year , two thirds of the total amount .

Friends : The comedy show that gives us some serious lessons about men Freundschaften
The lack of similar representations in shows is evident , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open itself has become even verzweifelter now than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men at a 15 year high .
In 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common in men than in women .
In a bid to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM - campaign announced at a erbärmliches life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
Friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressiven Symptomen verdoppelten has found that , when suffering a high enough percentage to friends with healthy mood , `` had his chances of recovery .
For those who are not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risk of mental problems .
But of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
In the age of the communications held on social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the direct nature of the response is often more important than the importance of full contact .
Our digital lives have fun the need to appear strong , and successful lives , doubled , even if in reality dominates the isolation .
This oberflächliche success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsische values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsischer go much deep values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has an impact on our mental health .
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently said that money ca n't buy happiness really .
The nice thing with Friends was that this focus has been placed on the head .
Each character was not defined by his work , but because of his personality , which was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey Chandlers frequent Umarmungen moments in football gucken gemütlichen armchairs and longing of Ross and Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to , in any case , even if they often zurückhalten to fully explore their feelings .
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me : ... `` my listeners role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has been really clear to me how even the smallest Interaktionen of friends can make a difference . ''
The men who contact us , often feel unable to talk with friends .
The old speech saying `` I come with that '' has a huge impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , if you talk about problems openly. ``
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer langfristigere coping mechanisms .
You clearly presents the small moments of men Freundschaften .
As much as my objektiver outsider status on the phone to people in Augenblicken of despair may help the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so if you visit this weekend Comedy Central with friends to celebrate the day completely newly designed scenery , why not take it with you to your friends a drink at the Central Perk .
Or , even better , if you see someone just sitting around in Star Bucks , you give him a smile and you say Hallo .
You never know what difference could make your friendship .

The Brexit camp ( Brexit = Britain 's exit from the EU ) to recruits could win if the economy by the year 2017 gets into a slump
David Camerons genialen crude Neuverhandlungs strategy , in order to keep Britain in the EU , with each day deeper in trouble , even without the election of Jeremy Corbyn to the Labour leader `` is it yes or no ? '' Or the Tuc for Europe on Tuesday sharply zerst ride .
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages .
A European diplomat friend said recently that some member states , so deeply enmeshed in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , even created Britain 's agenda with divided Zugeständnissen and malfunction Vertragsänderungen that they usually are not satisfied .
In Brighton , the Tuc decided at its annual meeting that it may not even if they threaten the social protection .
We could call it even Dave and Georges Selfie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister to climb to summit or bilaterale meetings in foreign capitals , a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local economies , then come home and say that they win allies for reform .
It is always about me .
Look through my European friend who wants an outside view of Britain inside the EU Zeltes - `` Lass leaves us not only with France , '' says Berlin - and that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some cities have come to the point where it is no matter to them , whether we stay or go .
Germany 's Chancellor Angela Merkel cautiously prudent is an ally , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them as Aush Arre as Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 is done with excessively long ) .
France 's François Hollande looks back on his reelection or his replacement in the year 2017 .
He is also a verb declining force .
Poland has probably soon left nationalistische right government , Spain .
It is hard to imagine that it is a leg ausreißen should be used to help the Selfie Britons , whose energy is better for Scotland 's exit from the UK - something they may not want to avoid , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
Therefore may be planning some sort of minister even deliberately not hilfreiche points , all in the SNP style , while Britain 's referendum campaign in 2017 , to speed up the process of Brexit , thought my friend .
`` The renegotiation was a bust , '' and `` Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation . ''
Tony Benn inspirierten Europeans know how robber in Fleet Street at their expense can be and what EU sceptics is the press Oligarchie Barone , as they were during the referendum in 1975 but were not supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
You are weak to remember Boris Johnson , the Erz euro Opportunisten , which has made a name as a `` EU Gerade banana '' Brussels correspondent in the early 90 's he years .
For all its craziness , Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies .
This was the Medley of tax for foreigners and the pseudo-Schurken , phone hack non Inländern most of our major newspapers have opened .
Tony Blair actually thought about it , but noted that if it sits in a cage with a hot Gorilla better instead of bananas to distract him , to be distributed to his lunch and dinner .
In fact , Miliband was more than Blairianer Blair himself , as he does not put on the Camerons referendum eddy because Blair had made the principle adopted the EU constitution , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him to a back door .
The press that has also never verziehen .
But the nette Jeremy Corbyn , of me in Westminster on Monday gave a friendly pat on the back - I told him that he was no more time for me to vergeuden need - Neil Kinnocks boycott Murdoch strategy to repeat the 80 `` s , a mistake at the time and now seems in danger .
It may take time , but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , the BBC sofa he has left on Sunday .
Corbyns official position on Europe - I press it 's friendly - in development .
He says that we should remain in a reformierten EU .
Well , most people outside of traditional blue color fabric trend and the more wild Gefilden Ukips of Torys Klein Engländerismus is probably all say yes .
It is zuzugeben what `` A Benn , not a Bennite , '' said Hilary Benn on the radio and on television this week , as the path finder fought in it , not that Corbyns provozierenden appointment of John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 70 's , when his old father on television is tried to be illoyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues not to go too far and his cabinet job to lose .
Hilarys fight was even more attractive .
But struggling to remain `` under all circumstances , '' Benns expression - was not what said McDonnell , nor what JC told his Mitstreitern and MPs after all the reports on their study session on Monday evening .
Whatever the rührselige Bottom Up image of Corbyn wants to convey - think that he has even me gerührt - news discipline is important in the era of TV around the clock and , above all , in the maelstrom of media Sozialen , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right , Cameron to give a free card for Europe , which allows him to keep for Labour 's support in the referendum campaign as a matter of course , McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyns basic Mehrdeutigkeiten for EU membership - in line with the Bennite Belagerungs economy , its anti-kapitalistischen past - is no longer just a matter of discussion among leftist dissidents , for the small Narzissmus esoterischen Unterschieds is a zentraler principle of Dogma `` disputes .
As with his Mehrdeutigkeiten to NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC is launching a campaign to leave rock festival - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in particular .
Why should waste political capital , Paris or Berlin - they have also , more skeptical voters - to make concessions to the British , when everything can be so pointless ?
The US is already pretty disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a Kostensenkung of Tory government in power , which at the start on Monday , I was reminded of something , which is called British Influence Security Forum .

Experts criticise Public Health England report on electronic cigarettes
Claims a state funded agency that electronic cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with ties to Tabakindustrie , said researchers .
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , joined by the Lancet to criticise Nachweise used by Public Health England ( PHE ) in her report on electronic cigarettes .
PHE published the `` principle '' report last month and describes him as a `` comprehensive review of the evidence . ''
But some researchers have called into question the Belastbarkeit data and pointed to the links between some of the experts and the Tabakindustrie .
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the `` außerordentlich windige basis , '' reasoned PHE on his most important conclusion .
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations `` are based on stone or sand . ''
Martin McKee , Professor of European Öffentlichde Simon Cape well , professor of epidemiology at the University of Liverpool Klinische and health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said : `` A fundamental principle is that policies should be based on the evidence of the effectiveness of public health . ''
They said that the public expects PHE 's assertion that `` the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking , '' based on a detaillierten review of Nachweise and modeling .
Indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a more technical criteria Entscheidungs analysis ( Multi Criteria Decision Analysis ( MCDA ) to lead their opinions about the damage of various nicotine containing products to Synthese ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health , whose CEO is previously received funding from British American Tobacco ( BAT ) for an independent study .
He also signed BAT 's references to public health in a Nachhaltigkeit report , they said .
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said to receive funds from an electronic cigarette manufacturers , but not the funding it after reports earlier should have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International , she added .
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered , but they include several known electronic cigarette champions , some of which also indicate an industry funding in the paper .
Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their Know how in tobacco control .
Taking part in the meeting also took the PHE tobacco pipe .
The group 's research , `` admits bezeichnenderweise , '' wrote that it is the damage of most products on most of the criteria `` for a lack of '' hard Beweisen McKee and Cape well .
But none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report will be discussed .
McKee and Cape well said that serve as a way to smoking for children or Nichtraucher PHE 's assertions that `` there is no evidence so far that electronic cigarettes were '' premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and wellbeing at PHE said that was already previously responded to the allegations by BMJ .
He said : `` Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . ''
Every second lifelong smoker dies at his Sucht .
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are small in comparison to this , but that we have to continue to study the long term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the dangers relativen compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease with regard to smoking and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion per year .
Through the clear Vorlegen current Beweisen that electronic cigarettes are not without risk , but represent only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .

Eight golden rules for living in student housing homes
Eleven years ago I moved than even vergessener 19 left Berets and moral Relativismus students in a residential home , still in the faith , but now I remind myself of the strained smile - and many of those who I 've geärgert langatmigen complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned , can be destilliert in eight simple rules .
The collection in student housing Heime ranges from slightly nervous aufreibend to absolutely terrifying .
It is tempting to tell schwatzen : People where you come from , if and where you have sabbatical year taken yet because of where you are in relation to Corbyn and why you love Marmite `` said neither honestly hate guys in seriousness , it is only an extract Hefe hahaha , I am '' in my room .
You breathe through .
And you help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
In contrast to those with whom you are talking about , even if your eyelashes were on fire and that fire had Löscher guides the conversation and helps you find the people who you would like .
Lassen people .
The rooms of people often turn to drink recipe ions , movie night venues and local meeting points , but they are also the places where people put themselves and their underwear right back .
Related to this , you start thinking not of the university with a relationship
Introverted get a rough treatment at the university .
Your room should be a Refugium , but many students living Heime form a room to room Bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship .
It can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
Nothing in the culture that allows you to say , `` I love you , and I want our friendship continues , but you have to weggehen so that I get the energy back I verbraucht for interaction with you . ''
You try to feel when a Kommilitone anzuklopfen Geselligkeit is exhausted - and you will send him a text message .
Speaking of anklopfen : You Tun .
A guy in my student residential homes had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
He saw a few things .
Backen close friendship .
As you begin the university at the height of the Back mania is the Klopfen at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of Brownies , less strange than the greeting of the 1950 's `` Welcome to the neighborhood , so I have baked you something . And now please smile , if I ask you a few personal questions . ''
Hausgemachte offering treats is a good way to close Freundschaften .
Their Mitbewohner feel obliged to entertain themselves and will associate at the end of your face , perhaps with a delicious surprise .
Of course this depends on whether you are a decent Bäcker .
Bad vermischte Klumpen lead from flour , sugar and fat , people are sleeping , if you anklopfen .
To steal food , is a gängiges crime in student residential homes .
Of course , the claws of Hühnchen is a theft , but it is also take a drop Milchs for your tea ?
You check the owner with the milk .
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook inside .
If someone stiehlt your stuff that is annoying , and you have my Mitgefühl - but you try umzugehen ausgewogener Spülmittel to punish thieves as my Mitbewohnerin added to their milk .
She is now in prison .
You should make no noise abhält people from sleep or work .
It is not just about being a decent person , but that they belong in the truest sense of the word say to the people who sit in the glass house .
A girl on my Flur asked their neighbours to ask whether it makes them a little Drum & Bass something quieter , because it 's three o'clock in the morning , and they had a test in the morning .
You responded with yet more loud music .
When they finally at 5 p.m. , they left their neighbours freundlicherweise sleep two hours before they had their own music aufhörten plärren abschloss their door and came to the three hour test .
Would it not be romantisch , if your future Ehepartner would randomly move students living in the same home ?
It might not be Mitbewohnerin Abgrund deeply embarrassing when you consider your future Ehepartnerin ranmachen to separate them again and they need to see it every day , and perhaps witness as herüber draws all common friends ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot Mitbewohnerin is definitely not your future Ehepartnerin you try , at least einzureden your body under a little bit of common sense .
Leave In aufregenden moment when you realize that someone has his keys in his room , the line between a Ulk and harassment is not verschlossenem feiner than it seems .
A good trick is funny , but it takes only moments before he is for Bumerang .
Erteilen jemandes Verstecken amüsante and a valuable lesson about security - but you never to flood rooms with dental toothpaste and shampoo .
You Verschließen not more than twice their door , and they put their keys in a glass of water , which you then put their possessions in the tackern Gefrierschrank - but you stuck to the ceiling .

`` I show how you can build cheap and good even today , '' says the 44 years old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are pushed in the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheaper Wohnraum can be created : It builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees .
Mr Gildner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
What solution you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The mass accommodation in Containern or gym halls has no Nachhaltigkeit .
Because people stay here to a large extent .
In light of the refugee Stroms Wohnraum we need enough in the next few decades .
A very banales three geschossiges Reihenhaus is the solution .
Gildner : A Reihenhaus needs less space .
It facilitates the integration .
This is different , if it brings people into residential blocks .
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three units for four Asylbewerber .
Each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living Aufenthaltsraum .
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back again .
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs .
What are the costs ?
Gildner : The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000 , without plot .
This is überschaubar .
Has taken six months of construction .
This is appropriate .
Have the paramotor verkompliziert their plans ?
Gildner , Baur Real , I have learned through my project correctly .
Particularly complicated there is always the threat of Damokles sword Sonderbau and the regulation of parking space .
Creepy .
It is still needs at least three who creates three apartments in a Reihenhaus Stellplätze .
Only in the cities is a lack of space for it .
And refugees and Asylbewerber have no cars .
As residents have responded to their Reihenhaus project ?
Gildner Asylbewerber : There have been those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings .
What is definitely not .
But do not exacerbate the competition by bezahlbare housing ?
Gildner : Bauboom in Germany is true : We have had in the last five years , but were built luxury flats that no one can afford more .
My project has the message that ordinary people also need Wohnraum .
Not only refugees , but as the single mother or the low earners .
I show how you can still build cheap and good .
So it goes .

Jewellery will Gardine - Plauener tip as a fashion niche
Earlier , went to the meter long machines in and around Plauen Stick to make it .
Bestickten fabrics and lace created in large quantities for customers , they continue verarbeiteten , for example , blankets and Gardinen .
That alone is no longer works today , Andreas Reinhardt , Managing Director of fashion tip Plauen explains .
Instead , the fashion is important again .
In the early days of the Plauener top fashion played a greater role , was then replaced by the home textile industry , and is now being discovered again as a niche .
Reinhardt cites some examples : Lead in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
Make the so called Vintage fashion anlehnt at last style eras , an increasing potential job at all .
Anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
With us , they already account for half of all orders .
Fashion tip Plauen is a member along with nine other companies in the industry association Plauener lace and embroidery .
They just can not bear the protected label .
Around 80 per cent in the past 15 years are Umsatzes weggebrochen .
Private specialist shops and the Großhandel there is almost no more .
Our products hardly reach the customers in this way .
The bulk commodity will today much more cheaply produced in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively on chains .
Also schwächle currently export to Russia and the United States .
Enough reasons so for new ways .
The industry association tried to score points by environmental consciousness , as Cordula Bauer said of the Stick Perle hawks stone : `` Since this year , we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce verträglich environmentally and socially . ''
Reinhardt added : `` It also refers to the materials used . ''
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches snow outside of West sächsischen Hochschule Zwickau , at the Faculty of Applied Arts , Berger and specialises in embroidery and lace .
Find high quality and innovative products in order to counter a bit of competition from the Asian region .
It takes time and courage .
It creates a Spannungsfeld between the fresh ideas of the designers and the Betrieben must think especially economically , `` says Schmidt .
Therefore , an existing design will often variiert only slightly , in order to keep a customer base .
A few years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter newly revitalized the historic pyramid top .
The machine stickt Kügelchen small in some places .
The gold smiths Plauener Champion Bianca Hall Bach Krauße could inspire them : `` Before I could start with traditional Plauener tip nothing . ''
Now she uses the snowball headed for their jewelry .
In an elaborate procedure they prägt the pattern in silver .
`` Many people in the region to identify with the subject Plauener lace - young and old , '' says Reuter .
It also supplies - mainly to customers in the United States , Australia and Finland , whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area , like a piece of memory .
So I see my jewelry as modern ambassadors of Plauener lace .

8 poll figures , which show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously .
Some brands have tried to fire him as Flop .
Others have dismissed it as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But no matter , as some Republicans are trying to draw from the upper echelons in polls down Donald Trump , it has not ( yet ) works .
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double digit range , and some are beginning to seriously ask themselves , what it means for the chances of the nomination of real estate Moguls .
Of course , it is still too early in the term .
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that has been made at this time in the year 2011 Rick Perrys led to rising Herman Cain , neither of whom won only one state in the nominating process .
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps by holding assets and begin to make their dollars go to overthrow him .
Here are some current poll ratings suggest that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase .
Trumps popularity ratings have rotated 180 degrees .
Shortly before the Real Estate Mogul Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid June , a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw positive .
Until the middle of July , there were 40 percent .
At the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
Six in 10 Republicans now have a positive opinion of Donald Trump .
About three in ten say that they have a negative opinion .
And those numbers keep in early states .
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump .
Two thirds of the GOP electorate GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate .
In a poll by CNN / ORC last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be `` enthusiastic '' or `` pleased '' if Trump were nominated .
Only two in 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the nominee .
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they are `` enthusiastic '' vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump ) .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with just 21 percent .
On the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters that they would be `` dissatisfied '' or `` angry '' if Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment would say to the candidate .
A majority of Republicans see Trumps temperament is not a problem .
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for its BOMBA tables and beleidigenden statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tendiere to the Republicans believe that the Estate Mogul have the right temperament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
The same number is the first state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same prefix 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a Oberbefehlshaber according to Quinnipiac last week .
However , 44 per cent think that they do not have the personality to run his office effectively , and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament is not passe to the White House , ABC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
If they put their scholars hats , Trump Republican voters believe to be real .
When they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , according to a poll by CNN / ORC , say four out of ten from the last week that Trump is the best bet .
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP voters had not the klarste Kristall ball in the past .
At this time last cycle to four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination only 28 % for the final candidates , Mitt Romney .
However , Trumps campaign shows that a large number of GOP voters see as plausible .
Even if the Republicans collected another candidate , Trump beats almost every .
Some experts point out that the zersplitterte field likely contributes to Trumps leadership , while the support Trump is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
A Monmouth University poll in early September , however , shows that the majority of support in a head to head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump hypothetischen reap .
He has 33 points ahead of Carly Fiorina 13 points ahead , with 14 points , 15 points ahead of Walker , 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio , Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie .
It is a head to head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the hypothetischen entrepreneurs with 19 points in a head to head race .
A knappe majority of Donald Trump fans says that they have formed their opinion .
A new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Trump , say that they have given their votes .
Much can be done to change that , and no one can really say , of course , to never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
Yet Trumps strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider , the neuro surgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say that they have formed their opinions are twice as often for Trump .
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration .
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago called immigrants from Mexico as `` rapists '' immigration was Dreh- und Angelpunkt in public discourse to 2016 .
Some are concerned that the BOMB Asti che expression of Trump will hold crucial Hispanic Americans out of the Republican Party and will damage the Neuorientierungs effort .
But according to the new ABC / Post poll on Monday that six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
As long as so verbleibt Rampenlicht immigration , it is apparently also do Donald Trump .
Frustration with the government klettert to new highs .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson is now roughly half the support of Republican voters , especially through their outsider status .
Six in 10 Republicans say they want a political outsider , rather than someone with experience of government in the new Montags poll by ABC / Post .
And they are also angry at Washington .
A Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress , angered by `` Howlin '' dissatisfied `` with 54 percent and 21 percent . ''

No , not in the Alt Otmar Bible , which is now published with beautiful images .
In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt , who has put his own personal interpretations of biblical stories in 150 Motiven on paper and canvas .
His `` language '' with bright colours and forms of fantasy full of 75 years old receive - but what is not synonymous with `` lustigen '' images .
On the contrary : Adapted The relevant issues that may seem rather bleak .
Around three years has worked on his Bible project , for which he has taken a subjective künstlerische Themenbereichen selection from the many of the `` book of all books '' Otmar Alt .
Zyklen address issues such as Way Plagen bids or are our father .
So he has fascinated spontaneously several partners : This applies to the Luther publisher with his Theo logical orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing with its emphasis on art books .
And as the author Klaus old post , who has studied with the respective Bible bodies on the basis of Malerei is above all .
He has interpreted the Bible selected by Otmar Alt ask Today , `` translated '' in current relationships and so on .
These texts are like verbale Alts mirror Malerei .
They are nestled between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who put his own personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
The jewellery cover has golden Lettern .
This allows the 75 year-old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high level of intimacy .
Emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible Project : Otmar Alt , 1940 in Wernigerode , born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that the strict protestantischen Herrnhuter Order served at all .
`` Because the education '' ever happened with the pipe floor , Otmar Alt recalls .
`` I tried aufzuarbeiten the father to vertragen me perhaps again with the Lord . ''
His second concern is to provide more value to the art schnelllebiger time and again : `` The perception of image worlds is now dominated by advertising , and it is loud .
Symbolik there will be ousted .
Artists have a different mood and Wonne to show things .
Pictures always have something full of mystery and are not dekorativ .
`` In this respect I am a dinosaur . ''
Otmar Alt would discover that the viewer into the images `` fall '' to allow them to work on themselves , and feel what power they have : `` The picture is his counterpart . ''
Klaus begreift old Post confessed on Tuesday in the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible Otmar Alt Foundation , to be `` always '' been a lover of Otmar Alts art : `` I like how he lives with his pictures . ''
Age have not been careful to fully grasp the Bible , but selected the issues important to him , even mysterious .
`` All the old post was no cooperation on an equal footing , '' says : `` Here is the images , the text explains . '' Emerged as a Bible pictures .
For Hans Möhler from Luther 's publishing this work is an invitation `` to deepen his life and find freedom . ''
Otmar Alts images speak for Möhler both ( biblische ) language of love and the responsibility .
Part of the Originale - Papier- and canvas paintings - is being presented for the first time in an exhibition , which opened on November 15 in the Otmar Alt Foundation .

`` Sono Genetics ' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the Nematoden change direction at the moment they are bestrahlt Impulsen with sound .
Scientists have gezüchtet Würmer genetisch modified nervous systems that can be controlled by Ausbrüchen by sound waves .
The tiny Nematoden change the direction at the moment they are bestrahlt Impulsen with sound frequencies that are too high for the human ear to be heard .
The stimulus work by Einschalten Moto Neuron cells genetisch be changed , in order to take the Membran channels that respond to ultrasonic waves .
Further on this subject : Read and write researchers brain activity with light
The researchers said that Würmer showed the power of a new procedure called sono Genetics at Ultraschall can be used to activate a series of Gehirn- Herz- and muscle cells outside of the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep brain stimulation , a abgibt invasives procedure that electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Thread Würmer does not usually respond to Ultraschall Chalasani , however , noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles .
The bubbles , he found , increase the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the Würmer .
The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures that are called TRP 4 ion channels and in the Membranen Würmer by some of the cells are found .
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells that they are zugeordnet , according to a report in Nature Communications .
In order to create Ultraschall controlled Nematoden Chalasani genetisch Würmer modified so that some of its Moto Neuronen TRP 4 ion channels .
If he applies Ultraschall on modified creatures that sound waves are amplified and transmitted through the micro bubbles in the Würmer , where they turn on the amended Moto Neuronen .
The case has some similarities with Opto Genetics , a bahnbrechenden tool allows the scientists Neuronen Impulsen des Lichts auszuschalten .
But sono Genetics Chalasani said , could have a number of advantages to this technique .
In contrast to light that needs to be sent down to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain tissue of low frequency ultrasound waves can happen without hindrance , and can be sent from the top of the skull in the brain .
`` We believe that with Gentherapie and a therapeutischen virus , it is possible to make the zielten human Neuronen temporarily vulnerable for Ultraschall signal in a klinischen setting for certain neuro logical treatments , '' Chalasani said .
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin produzierende cells , he added .

Croatia : `` We let the refugees ''
`` Now also be Grenzkontrollen high risks on our southern border , '' said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl Leitner .
The controls remain in parallel to the Hungarian border .
Still Asylantrag , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a `` natural '' could also make .
The care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
Clear is that `` it needs clear signals , '' the minister said .
People need to know that we do not accept grenzenlose Migrationsströme nor on österreichisch and Slovenian border .
It needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering `` corridor '' - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously communicated , Slovenia also wants to leave ankommende refugees continue to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany and possibly build Korridore for the refugees .
This saw Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach but not quite so .
The idea of Korridoren was `` absolutely unacceptable , '' will instead step up surveillance of the border , especially in Hungary , Slovenia .
The border with Croatia was as Außengrenze of the Schengen area , on the other hand , is already heavily controlled .
As the Minister emphasised Slowenin wants abriegeln but not its borders for refugees .
`` Every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system may not work , '' said Györkös Znidar .
As the Croatian government announced the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday , einzureisen Ostkroatien on Grenzübergang Tovarnik / Sid over to avoid registering .
The Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
According to local media , police vehicles with new refugees ever meet in Tovarnik kroatischen ever since .
It is mainly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
Emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
His country in the coming days with around 4,000 refugees rechne , Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said .
Buses from Presevo would also according to mazedonisch umgeleitet Serbian border , which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
The government in Belgrade denied , however , that she was there Anweise people to follow certain routes : `` Either we can , nor do we want to do this , '' it said .
According to media reports , the first bus is at least in der Früh arrived with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid , more buses were expected over the course of the day .
On Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on the road the whole night of mazedonischen border with Serbia , about 500 kilometres away .
`` We have heard that Hungary has added power , so the police have told us that we should go here , '' said one of the refugees .
They wanted to continue to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
So could it actually to shift the previous Balkan route to Turkey , Greece , Macedonia and Serbia and Hungary already predicted by observers to come a little further west route .
Croatia : `` Extensive opportunities for border control . ''
Kroatiens Interior Ostojic zust Rome of refugees had previously stressed that his country was prepared in the event of a strong corresponding plans for possible emergency situations .
Details not mentioned it , but he pointed out that Croatia as non-Schengen member `` have extensive opportunities for border control . ''
We have strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia is a good testimony that since 2007 , the EU partners call throughout the country since then , as regards the standard of Grenzkontrollen .
Serbischer side about 300 refugees continue to firmly stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
According to media reports they had spent the previous night at Horgos Grenzübergang , which leads to Röszke , Belgrader .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two Grenzübergänge Horgos and Backi Breg continues to remain closed .
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel further to kroatischen border is still unclear .
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to reassure early Wednesday morning at a local eye slip in Horgos : He think the debates about alternativ routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , is premature .
It would not currently be very high numbers of refugees .
It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Migrant workers - dangerous - alternativ route rates
However , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are located on the refugees from Croatia .
Stepping on the border between Serbia and Croatia is not ungefährlich : Geräumte mine fields in parts of the border area , it is still not even 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia .
On Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern Grenzregion was sent .

Peter Moody says that stewards tried to spy him and threatens to end the racing sport
Peter Moody claimed that Racing Victoria stewards tried to install a Spion in his stables in the past year and threatened to end the race .
He zielte by Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the Late Lady Tatai Scratching Halm on Wednesday due to a race day treatment , the last straw , to the stewards and the Integritäts department .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he did when it came to the positive cobalt Tupfer test at Lidaris vorgefunden themselves under difficult conditions which he can not explain .
He had 18 months because of espionage charges that it withheld and did not `` look like at high hanging grapes . ''
`` I had to say anything about it , and I have spent a long time out , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , '' Moody said .
You know that it went further .
Sometimes you responded , and we must live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to collected head to go around , and I would like to think that my owner that I try my best for them .
If they start to think , I do not do this , then I should no longer be coach .
I must then consider what I do with my license .
Previously had the bomb in an interview with Moody Racing .com can go high that Integritäts department had tried to spy on his stall .
`` Eighteen months ago , Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I 'll call when I am asked what I do - and offered him a job in my stables , in order to provide information on Racing within my Ställe , '' Moody said .
You seem to believe that I am a fraudster .
If that is the case , it should certainly be on their noses , because they have failed in an attempt to catch me .
Robert Roulston , former chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of the RVL were aware of this at the time and there are still today .
Would like to bring this to the view that it is personally ?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and makes perhaps people outside of trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I so bad for the industry ?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am there .
Maybe they need to let me take my license and offend me , and I have no doubt that what I say , they think about it now .
But I have now reached the point where it is no matter to me , and that makes me sad .
That makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The frustrations levels of Trainers have with the long ongoing cobalt investigation in Lidari built , and the Late Scratching meant that he said that he `` could throw his license on the table . ''
Moody , best known through his preparation of Black Caviar ungeschlagenen master , called the race day Behandlungs rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the legs of horses , which was against the rules .
`` It is against the rules of racing sport .
I must take full responsibility for that , `` he said .
`` One of my employees has applied irrtümlicher mud on the leg .
It was last night as can be .
May be so it had throughout the day yesterday , which was also the case .
It was also so Renntag .
Moody could be faced with a three month Disqualifikation for the treatment with the pack on Renntag . Opened an investigation into this matter .
It is a joke .
People who make these rules do not know anything about the horse .
`` We all see that we need rules , but it has gone too far , '' Moody said .

Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team , but it is still hard
Has selected in England 's squad for the trip to face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if one sees is not a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card .
I would not rule out an away victory .
Alastair Cooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good Spin players in the Batting list and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear scars of 2012 , only a young and positive attitude .
Moeen Ali as Spin Bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , developed with the ball is an option for the attack .
Related news : Adam Lyth scheidet from the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales .
The decision to let Adam Lyth is difficult for me to analyse as his head coach in Yorkshire , of course , .
There were two good attacks in difficult conditions in his seven Tests , and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results .
There was no question mark there with Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nomination - and I said this vorhin - players are their own best chooser .
A long time ago , it would have extended the run of Lyth , but he had control of his own destiny .
If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire , comes another chance .
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even if he was not so good services rendered , and it does not surprise me ; he is a team man .
The question of how much time a test shot man gets to put his characters is difficult .
Lyth got seven chances , as Sam Robson got in front of him , while Nick Compton nine .
Only Compton got the chance to play Heim- and abroad .
The only accusation you can levy was that England was first used in the Caribbean - Jonathan Trott as Lyth in peak form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex Hales comes in , and he is a hit man I einschätze high .
He is an X factor Cricket players , what we saw in Yorkshire early in this season , when he scored against us at Trent Bridge pitch 236 , which made us very .
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him , but that of course depends on the team to a position in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of Moeen beat next to Cook to leave , which would provide an Extra Spin Bowler and received four Quicks , appeared on , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why ca n't beat a man there , and this left-handed has already shown that he is a devil guy from Cricket players .
Moeen has perhaps not done its job for Worcester County hire , but he is a number 3 for them , and because there is no big difference .
My former team mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop , before he appeared in 2001 as Opener .
He has now made three hundred runs and has not looked back .
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as Back Up Spinner and , in my limited dealings with him , he impressed me as a young man .
People may see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Punt , but there are a large number of Backup Spinnern raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Apart from the England team has made a few clever Ergänzungen in the coaching staff .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , Batsman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup .
He is one of the game 's most nette guys mitbringen a wealth of experience , as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball part of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup .
I always felt that he created for the International Cricket competition is as a player or as a coach and as Mahela has Einsichten , from which we can benefit from it .
Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the cabin Umkleide , even if the messages are consistent with what has previously been said .
Collys team colleague in Durham , Ben Stokes , is not used in the One Dayers Root received a similar break against Australia and , for my part , I have no problem with that .
Some will not agree , but Coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable .
And you must bear in mind that their jobs depend , as with the players from the results .
Such decisions are not taken with a light heart .

And what the Dorfbewohner think about his goal to be mächtig man of the world ?
`` I believe that this is kind of exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter type , '' says Simone Wendel .
The native Kallstädterin has a amüsanten documentary about the place and its famous Sprösslinge shot , which in addition to Trump , the Heinz Ketchup family matters .
Not known for Bescheidenheit , Trump comes in `` Kings of Kallstadt '' ( 2014 ) - so to speak with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Kallstadt .
For the king of hearts , he did not put it there .
While there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to be the opinion that Trump was `` in a bit of a big mouth , '' says Wendel .

Then comes from the village of Trump Angeber .
The Trump 's success story began in 1885 , when the late grandfather emigrated and a restaurant opened in the United States for gold diggers .
Foundations of the real estate company were first land purchases in New York .
But the lives of the grandparents was not free of tragedy : Her desire to return on a permanent basis in the home , the Bavarian state that the Palatinate was then failed .
He took without permission , the director of the Institute for Trump , because he had once been hauen pfälzische history and popular customer , Roland Paul , had declared the film start .
Auswanderers Trump was the grandson of an `` illegal . ''
That stands in contrast to statements of descendants mark at times .
He had repeatedly spoken contemptuously about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall , abzuschrecken about illegal immigrants .
`` As the poltert is not so sympathisch ( `` The grandma was a baby , `` says Hans Bender , entfernter Verwandter Trumps Trump , grandpa was geborener Heinz '' ) .
The vintner aufbrausend retired sees the Americans rather aloof , `` he is always so . ''
He Glaubt , that Trump is coming ?
`` I can imagine me not , '' says the 72 years old .
`` He has never cared about Kallstadt . ''
The guesthouse landlady Veronika Schramm said as some Kallstadter that come after the family donated Heinz during a visit to something for the church organ , which was generally good .
`` I can imagine me by Donald , '' says the 68 years old .
You think it would be better if he gewänne the election because `` the has such radical views , I do n't know if that is a good thing . ''
If those who call the shots on his grandfather 's time in the US , he would have been like , `` he would never arrived there at all . ''
`` There are more issues than him , '' Inter San winemakers daughter Sarah Bühler says .
And as President ?
`` My president is '' it is not , she says .
And : `` The grapes are ripe without the President Trump . ''

FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must be behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere , it was not until September and provided his Rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan , there is no reason why he ca n't play again before Christmas .
I am sure this optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England and , given his history , his participation in next summer 's European Championship , is still uncertain .
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate Knöchel violation and then again was back to his old swing found during the Vorsaison .
This kind of `` at risk of injury , not the career , '' Wenger said .
It is a bone heilte not good .
This is not a major issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not in connection with his Knöcheln or with the injuries that he had before .
That may be true , but as Wenger also acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injury from a purely medical point of view , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
It also develops a unangenehmes pattern .
The study by Premier injuries Ltd 23 different diseases of Wilshere recorded since his debut six years ago .
League games in the last five games he played in just 65 of Arsenals 157 times .
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have suffered the most injury days in six of eight times since 2007 / 08 .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season .
`` Sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and combat force , '' said Wenger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabilized durchlaufen , I am confident that he will do it and he is a career of the sort that he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday , and Wenger is a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start .
Wenger can also start with Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs and Theo Walcott .
`` I try to keep the balance and '' the players who need it to treat a small Verschnaufpause , Wenger said .
Although Arsenal are clear favorites in Group F play on the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds in Europe with the biggest effect of intimidation .
Unge beat Dynamo after 41 games , after the `` unbesiegbar '' campaign was launched in the last season .
The stadium has been shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , and 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale .
This year , it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lesson from the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope with his management to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '' Wenger said .
It has never worked at Arsenal .
In 2006 , we were very close to it , but on the other hand , I am in business long enough to be realistic .
We are ehrgeizig , but we are not dreamers .

Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores before an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia .
Food Großhändler Metcash has a Bodenständigkeits campaign launched to defend the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Aldi invasion .
While Aldi opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia prepared early next year to strengthen its relationship with local food suppliers and IGA Sozialen by marketing and marketing on the mainstream media to build the brand , as well as events such as Metcash and IGA Supermärkte Adelaide show .
IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo DUNS Borough distributed in IGA stores samples and shop owners verbilligte treue customers sell tickets for the South Australian Football League .
It is expected that if the Großhändler on food , alcohol and equipment conducts its annual investor Strategietag Metcash released more details of its defence strategy on September 29 .
There is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA store transactions and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in Oststaaten .
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a far greater share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia Oststaaten compared to about 14 percent .
However , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi is twelve months after opening its first markets wegschnappen around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states and all existing players , but mainly selbständigen individual traders wegnehmen sales .
According to a report published this week estimated by Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath , Metcash and IGA retailers $ 360 million in sales per year could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and WA in 30 next year and $ 500 million and $ 600 million in sales in each market .
The loss in the food and grocery business and at amounts based on Metcashs high Fixkosten Metcash could cost around $ 13 million of earnings before interest and taxes , Mr Kierath said .
At the same time loses Metcash Oststaaten Marktanteile , mainly to Aldi and Coles , although a survey recently conducted by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley notes that Metcashs sales will fall in food and grocery business by 3.8 percent in the year 2016 , at 4.1 percent in the year 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in the year 2015 to 10,3 % by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund manager Hamish Doug estate , told the founder of Magellan Financial Group , with a Geschäftsessen in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a Jahrzehnts . Metcash .
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr. Doug estate .
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash has included contact with Mr. Doug approved last week .
IGAS share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Metcashs food and food trade , which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers , has fallen by 43 % since 2012 , which reflects the operational debt reduction in gleichzeitigem pressure on sales and margins .
However , the Großhändler refuses and invested more than $ 150 million in sales prices anzugleichen hundreds of products each week with Coles and Woolworths , IGA to improve individual traders in the improvement of their stores by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label foods .
Metcashs Chief Executive Ian Morrice says that the purchase price adjustments and store refurbishment programmes to Elan and hopes that the Großhändler will return to profit growth in the year 2017 for the first time in four years .

`` It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe '' - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not absorb all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
The Tibet-buddhistische leader called on to put an end to the violence in the Heimatländern the refugees .
The Dalai Lama said the problem with the ongoing refugee crisis in the UK at the start of his ten day visit in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compas Ion in Oxford , the ethics studies .
He claimed that the interests of humanity should be called before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the given circumstances .
He also stressed that the response to the refugee crisis of the Western European countries admire worth while , but the situation is not appropriate .
`` It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , '' he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria 's efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
`` To take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long term solutions , such as a genuine Friede and real development , mainly through education , can be created for these Muslim countries , '' he said .
Ultimately , we need to think about how the killing was reduced in their countries .
We need to reduce the use of force .
`` The use of violence has never solved these problems , '' he added .
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and George Bush 's action also commented after the September 11 Terroranschlag and emphasised that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of uncontrollable events .
After September 11 , I have expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in nonviolence .
`` I know his motives were good , but he set up violence , and this has led to unexpected consequences , '' the Dalai Lama said .

David Cameron The Lorax certainly knows better ?
There is one thing that all parents soon learn : If your child loves a book , it will be not long before you know it almost auswendig .
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems , the prime minister decided to name his favourite children 's book , The Lorax , published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. Seuss .
It was a difficult choice , writes Cameron super camps in a message on the company 's website , and has continued : `` Funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I vorlese like my children , because it always seems a picture or to give a message that we have missed so far . ''
All well and good , except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book instead of a film version of 2012 wiedergibt Inhaltsangabe new characters and details added to expand the relatively short Originaltext .
`` In the midst of the city ummauerten Thneed Ville where all of nature is gone , and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams , in their desire to see a real tree , fulfilled , '' reads one . A love interest was Dr. Seuss , whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
As if that were not suspicious enough : The text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax movie , which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : `` In the city ummauerten Thneed Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams . ''
Although he zugibt pragmatischer a father to be here , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the plot of the book so little . Hears cases of an unnamed boy , such as the local environment by the greed of money and trees , despite the protests of the name Lorax Thneed Strick Once-ler , a Hock end schnurrbärtigen beings , `` that speaks on behalf of the trees , '' is devastated .
Most likely was such a relatively low PR task a helper delegiert who has read The Lorax 20 times in a row , not a child .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text was likely to come by Camerons constituency office .
Super camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Camerons employees , but gave no further unmittelbaren comments .

Angela Merkel and the Flüchtlingspolitik : `` We create the ''
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Bundeskanzlerin is determined to adopt them .
What comes to Germany ?
Around 800 000 Asylbewerber Germany is even capable of absorbing a million refugees will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Interior this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) .
Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination : `` I say again and again : We can create that , given the unusual challenge and we create it . ''
What zukommt on Germany , gives the following overview .
Used to be different forecasts between 350000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400000 ( estimate of Pestel Institut ) homes a year - and for the next five years .
That is almost twice as much as 250000 homes will be built ( so far ) .
Dramatically , the lack of Wohnraum is , however , especially with bezahlbaren rental properties : A year fall out 60000 to 80000 social housing refugees from the rental price fixing , and this particularly affordable housing will also apply .
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) will therefore double the promotion of currently 518 million to one billion euros .
Far too little is that from the point of view of Pestel Institut : Social housing 80 000 a year would have to occur and that would have the federal government invest a promotion to the tune of 6.4 billion per year .
Are scientists and federal construction minister agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
According to estimates from the Institute for work Markt- and professional research is expected that 55 percent of Geflüchteten can eventually be acquisition work in Germany .
Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education , however , were not systematically asked for their qualifications , in order to help them at the start , criticised the refugees in Germany in Bertel Mann Foundation .
For the integration of refugees is crucial , however , is whether they can find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts for the appreciation in the host society , but also for the self esteem of immigrants , migration for Douglas Dietrich Thränhardt says .
There has been a political turning point : The ban on work for refugees in recognition of work according to Thränhardt in Germany .
Whereas before there was a ban on work for Asylbewerber by up to five years , this has been reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the duty of residence , limited Asylbewerber at a residence .
In the view of society - also because of a lack of skilled workers - the majority has asserted that refugees should be allowed faster access to employment .
A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of English .
So far there are no ausreichendes offer language courses related to education and work .
Studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
The construction of networks is therefore Thränhardt view of the royal road to integration work .
The Berlin school administration found that few geflüchtete parents give their children in Kitas , there are an estimated 10 to 15 percent : `` For the entwurzelten zuhalten parents is very important , the family together , '' says Ilja Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
In order to convince the family still hand slip from the benefits of Kita , the administration distributed in different languages .
The need for female educators should rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example , by allowing more schools .
Students in the countries without knowledge of German welcome classes are prepared for the classroom .
You are fully trained but not always informed Lehrerinnen and teachers , but also , as in Berlin , of teaching staff who have a qualification in English as a second language .
There is no shortage of them , says Beate Stoffers of Berlin school administration .
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle , no state Asylbewerbern or patience , but prohibits the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , inside Senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now given up his attitude .
Studierwilligen refugees could be made easier access to university .
For refugees with a stay Gestattung Asylbewerber performance or Duldung receive no benefits under the law , if they start a study .
The latter have basically no Bafög , because they are not covered by the circle of people entitled to BAföG .
Geduldete refugees have so far had to have lived in Germany for four years , in order to be Bafög right from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months .
This funding gap needs to be closed , Steffen Krach Berlins undersecretary for science , and the German student demand .
Students should immediately get Bafög .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many of the refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should give Islam gradually the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right weiterentwickeln Religionen ratio to a new state .
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic charity drive professional association that cares for the newcomers .
Belong to the rights and obligations .
As the representatives of Islam must agree on clear Ansprechpartner and be willing to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some Kontrollmöglichkeiten .
This also includes the willingness to act against religious Fundamentalismus beherzt .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Aiman Mazyek , expressed the concern that religious conflicts will be taken to Germany on Thursday .
Those who have wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany , `` to immediately have their right , the Bayrischen Rundfunk verwirkt here , in Germany , '' he said .
He proposed to translate the Grundgesetz to Arabic .
Integration will be a theme of the whole society , much longer than today .
So that the majority of society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and racism is pushing .
Germany has a point against discrimination and Allgemeines equal opportunities law - as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade .
But it is very slow , as the NSU murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
Equal opportunities for all : What not white German immigrant organizations and interest groups are calling for a long time and what international agreements require Germany , such as the Anti Racism Convention , must be a reality in the next few years , if the country remain peaceful and his new Bürgerinnen citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
In general , Germany was able to feed the refugees expected to date medical doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says .
`` In terms of man- power and capacity we create that , '' he told the Daily Mirror .
But for that extra money has to flow into the system .
In order to avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery calls for health cards to hand all the same Ankömmlingen during registration .
Services provided could be abgerechnet later with the states .
And in the long run , it is highly fragwürdig abzuspeisen vorsehe so many people with limited performance catalogue , the Asylbewerber performance law .
Otherwise , the doctors are , above all , to create the language barriers .
So far , the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven , migrants will be aufgeklärt about their illness worse than other patients .
Praxen Dolmetscher costs would be taken not only in clinics , also a doctor , she urges .
Helped would be many refugees but also with more general medical Ambulanzen starting points in the event of an emergency .
And with another diagnostischen look .
Under refugee children , for example , give it far more unbehandelte disabilities and HIV awareness among young people go there .
German doctors would come in terms of their education but clear , with the images of some other disease , Montgomery says .
`` Para Siten Befall or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize . '' And regarding the lack of doctors , even relief in sight is perhaps by the refugees .
The Syrians have a high entwickeltes education , many refugees are even doctors .
To practice , they would have to prove their skills , however , might take exams again .
At least half of the refugees in Germany ankommenden is mentally ill , according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of psychological therapists ( BPtK ) : Most suffer from post traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Refugee children are particularly verletzlich explains BPtK Dietrich Munz , President .
A recently published study of the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumatisiert .
Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder , suffers from others in so called flash backs with Atemnot , dizziness , heart lawn and Todesängsten .
Other symptoms Schlaf- and concentration problems , firm strong shock and emotional taub are .
In order to prevent that the symptoms would be chronically , an early treatment needed , Munz said .
So far , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive a psychotherapy .
Mentally ill Asylsuchende in Sozialämtern can make a request for psychotherapy , but the treatment usually takes several months .
Subject officials or doctors were not trained for mental illness in the Sozialämtern also tend to decide whether or not a therapy is necessary .
This often leads to false assessments , Munz says .

Election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over Bernie Sanders in the national poll , halved
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her .
Clinton has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries now ) ( 58 percent ) , while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent ( previously increased by 17 percent .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
More than five months before the start of the primaries , most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is which candidate they will support .
But Clinton 's Unterstützer are consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
Since the CBS News poll has Clinton lost on a number of demographic groups , while Sanders posted some gains .
Clinton holds a large lead among women and Gemäßigten , but these Vorsprünge have decreased .
Their support among men has dropped significantly , and Sanders is here only by 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has verflüchtigt , and she and Sanders are now at the same level .
Clinton still has a big lead among older voters .
Last month was Clinton , Sanders , with two adjustable lead for the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party .
A quarter of them would support with some Vorbehalten and another 15 percent , they would only support because she is the candidate .
Six percent would not support it .
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton 's current Unterstützer are particularly excited by it .
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would enthusiastically support .
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
If Clinton 's Unterstützer will be asked in an open question as to why they want that she is the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
From Clinton 's supporters also mentions her relationship with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
Approval for dealing with the problems and the wählbar are also cited .
As the vice president raises a potential for the presidency in the Waagschale , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him in the race - even though a third believed that he should not do it .
If Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice party , Biden is at the top .
Far more than half of Clinton 's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice Sanders .
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton 's lead over Sanders , increases of 20 points with Biden in Wettlauf on 30 points without him in the race .
Fünfundfünfzig percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election , but that number has fallen from 78 percent in the last month .
Biden is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the `` most wählbar '' has risen by far .
Still , the question on what is important in a candidate , give Democratic voters questions about the wählbar .
Much like last month , not a single Demokratischer candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters in the primaries as unacceptable .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates of their party primaries yield good results in some important features for voters .
See Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong Mehrheiten Führungsqualitäten .
Biden schneidet honesty , while Clinton 's strength is the lead in the best of the three candidates .
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic primary voters see Clinton , Sanders and Biden also generally ideologically in line with their views .
With all these measurements , about a quarter of Democratic voters has no opinion of Sanders .
As questions are asked to continue during the tenure as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal email address and one of Servers , Democratic primary voters are the most satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole .
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
Half of Americans is now unhappy with their statement , while only around a third is satisfied .
Public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
Most Americans have said that the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , while 36 percent said that their opinion of her is even worse .
There are mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
Although Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under eingetragenen voters as a whole : Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and less 15 points since May .
62 percent of the electorate do not keep them for an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time , 55 percent of voters nationwide see Trump as not honest and trustworthy .
However , Clinton and Trump received good marks for leadership .
Of the six candidates tested Biden , Carson and Bush schneiden best with honesty .
A majority sees Sanders rather than honest , but as with Carson , many have no opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .

`` That emerges again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke about fighting ring , as they have beaten us 24 : 2 , '' Bellamy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that , throughout the year , we have changed nothing in our defensiven Trendwende system or techniques . But in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus , and that has provided for us .
Trent is obviously a great team to train there for three years now , and he has to lose , and he is therefore probably not accustomed to , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
It is funny how that appears again and again in this season .
Bellamy Bennetts idea was attacked as a `` football from '' exciting football `` and his mentor reminded that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with '' long .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He has compared his game on Saturday evening with our game on Friday night , and how exciting it was , `` said Bellamy .
I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a long because team , and Wayne said that he will attend a Scheiß dirt .
But now he has a team that can play and that we regard as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
This is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kind of players .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play the kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like this .
I baue stronger confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit concerned , having to play against us .
Six weeks ago , they probably have not thought of us when it came to the big games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS achieved a better result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys .
The Broncos ' game was a good game , I have not yet seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but it is an exciting game ?
Make or break and Spannendes no points ?
For me , it is the game plans .
When they mention us , it means that we will meet in a stage still on it .
The Storm team has released this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the cron Ulla Vorfinale Sharks next Saturday night at AAMI Park . The ticket sale will start from next Tuesday morning .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
On the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP Entschärfung has the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
The controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which is far more traditional dishes in its operation .
`` We want to set up a system to which the public trust , '' the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the launch .
The pig Edinburgh intends to submit the proposal for a European negotiating position in free trade talks with the United States .
The German government announced support .
By TTIP will create the world 's largest Freihandelszone with 800 million people .
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedure see states specifically that the EU and the US together independent judges to select a new investment Court .
You should come in equal parts from the EU , the US and Drittstaaten .
Planned a second instance is also for the first time .
You would allow it to collect on judgments .
So far the procedure involved an appeal against their sentences were not agreed among themselves to judge .
In the discussion of the last few months had not made it clear that the old system of ISDS citizens in terms of fairness and justice , vertrauten Malmström commented .
In the long run , they will hinarbeiten according to their own figures on a Internationales investment court .
There could then be resolved , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
The investor state arbitration procedure requested by large corporations ( ISDS ) , in particular , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice on which companies can only Reiten damages at the expense of the taxpayer , aushebeln national laws or enforce a reduction of Verbraucher- Umweltstandards .
In first opinions anti TTIP organizations like Campact described the EU Commission 's proposals as insufficient .
Criticism that they should not apply to the free trade agreement with Canada ( CETA ) was already ausgehandelte above all .

For easy gewichtige diabetics can be helpful for weight loss surgery .
The benefits of weight loss surgery is easy on gewichtige people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years according to a new study .
It is still too early to say whether easy gewichtige chirurgische people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive treatment .
`` The mortality data need a long time to show something , '' said Dr. Robin Black Stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery .
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to get the size of the Magens verkleinern .
You reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
Over the years obesity operations have been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out on people who are ill arrest fettleibig with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24,9 .
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered fettleibig .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , the researchers used data from Taiwan 's Min Sheng General Hospital , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery , gastric Bypass and stomach tubing including education , medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those who undergo this operation , fell from 31 to 24,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
Meanwhile remained roughly the same in 29 of the BMI in those who received non chirurgische diabetes treatments
Among those who undergo a surgery completely solved the diabetes disease at 36 % and 28 % in part .
In the medically treated group succeeded in only about two percent compared to only one percent of diabetes in full or in part .
In addition , were the results in the control of blood pressure , triglycerides and `` bad '' LDL Cholesterins `` generally better in the surgery group , '' the authors found out .
The researchers also überwachten mirror of the patient 's blood Hämoglobin A1c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
Hämoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
After the surgery , the average Hämoglobin A1c level fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group but remained stable at around 8 percent .
But these better glykämische `` control '' - as it is reflected in the improved Hämoglobin A1c level - not reduced mortality in five years , the Leitende researcher Dr. Chih Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
The fifth year the Bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrektomie group had lost more weight ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , achieved greater reverse course in BMI ( 7.4 at 5.1 ) and Hämoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a more complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46,9 % vs. 16.7 % ) .
While the new study shows no survival before part of the surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black Stone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix .
In the Swedish study was in obese people who undergo an obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years , compared to a group , the konventionellere tried methods .
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients , said Black Stone , it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process .
`` This is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , '' no increased risk of death or kidney disease , they said .
Black Stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
`` I think that we wait too long , until we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that a reversal `` as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that are associated with obesity and diabetes in their body is really hard .

Why I will be able to witness a Exekution in Oklahoma
A little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is put to death .
If it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary , when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection .
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
The invitation has been on his best friend , and although I was shocked I agree , for the first time in January .
As the day got closer , I began to fear me .
So , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would provide a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists must see Hinrichtungen makabere lottery in the United States , and often there are more applications than places available , will take place to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
Whoever is chosen will watch it without emotion .
I ca n't .
I will sit alongside Richard Glos IPS engstem friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with Telefonaten and a visit to two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot if we are talking about .
The prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will be allows me a notebook and a pen mitzunehmen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter , give up my impartiality .
Here is the lesson .
You tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you get access .
I values me with her .
You admitted that `` it could be better , '' but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glossip has had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
He tells me not to say what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter is present , in order to write there .
If he dies , he thinks that the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell Ware , a report in the Huffington Post , is sitting next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , please hear the Podcasts series , which I have done .
I will not go back on all the details .
I ca n't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a Begünstigter fact .
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from this perspective , I will see him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn for that .
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die a needless death .

He called for `` less theatre and more facts '' at this weekly event .

A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had `` been in respect of silence '' and he had recognised the `` heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England . ''
But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told the BBC News Two night program that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem , `` independent '' of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns top team , and they called on differences in defence and foreign policy , the economy , while less than a Sechstel Parlamentarischen party supported him initially as a leader .
Of the BBC correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences within Labour `` Politische stapeln 'after Mr Corbyns statements on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits .

In a feurigen qualification game in Cincinnati soon after Kokkinakis and his opponent , Ryan Harrison , twice had to be separated by the referee , with Harrison ausrief : `` Beat Wawrinka should have Kyrgios , and I should beat the child . ''
While he was last seen , as he was a tennis racquet zerschlug , after a Krampf vereitelte a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis Healy steadfastly defended .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup semifinals against Britain .
`` One thing that I was , in my view , is the fact that Thanasi hineingezogen ereifere me quite a bit in the dispute , '' Healy said .
He has broken a racquet when he lost in the US Open because of a Krampfes , but he is not the first player Thanasi has broken a racquet in frustration with himself , and I know well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , really , he has behave extremely well in the US Open , even under the circumstances pretty provokativen with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
He has a great team around himself , he has a great family around themselves , and I believe that he was treated a bit too strict .
He is a very mature 19 years , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in Umkleide areas , he trains hard , he is in good shape , he is a very stable and young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own Verdiensten ausgereifter .
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios in the important decisions , which begins on Friday , and he describes the joint decision as the right one for everyone , but he is the man from Canberra , as long an integral part to return to the team. ``
`` First , we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not '' to all the controversies rundherum [ Kyrgios ] , Healy said .
Schlimme very quickly and I think Nick has managed the rise , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , he is rising in the eyes of the public , and he has made some mistakes and some time outside the Rampen Lichts deserves all the criticism he gets , but we are trying to support him , we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions . He can only think about it I think is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him .

Federal Reserve Strategen two days this week to spend their most anticipated meeting in years sitting around a 27 foot Honduras mahogany table , in order to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in almost a decade .
Drohend verzierten , two of them at one end of the floor sitting room is a wall painting of the United States .
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation above all other things .
The Fed has a dual mandate from Congress : Maximierung US employment and keep prices stable here .
But since the Great Recession , the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is a shouted unge Benes third mandate : Financial stability .
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predict them . It is to be announced on Thursday , if the US economy is ready to start , from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate close to zero since late 2008 entwöhnt .
Although most economic data show that it is growing solidly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials anxious to strengthen this volatility by increasing the Zinses for Bunds - and it is also only about a quarter of a percentage point .
`` Obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important in the first place , what they '' see Lindsey M. Piegza , Chefökonomin at the brokerage firm Stifel Nico Laus said & Co .
`` But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty is enough justification to continue to wait around the global market , '' she said .
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do , which unsettled the financial market to itself .
About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently have predicted a rate increase this week .
Financial markets expect the Fed , with a key indicator , but a Abwarten anzeigt only a 30 % chance of an increase .
This indicates a decline in the stock market , if the Fed increases the sentence , unless that Strategen abmildern blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points , or 1.4 % to 16.599,85 .
The action has been triggered by expectations that the Fed policy this week 's sentence aufrechterhält , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time , `` he said .
If it does , `` they would have to go very far in their statement , in order to reassure the financial markets , so that they are not in panic . ''
Other experts argued that a rate increase would reassure the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
A month ago , the Fed seemed on the way to increase the rate of 0,25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a langsamen tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States .
Yellen had said that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress this year they would be required to expect a rate increase in spring and early summer .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and in the vicinity of the Levels , the Fed considers Vollbeschäftigung .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And although inflation was constantly under the year target of 2 % of the central bank , said the Fed 's representatives that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower Ölpreisen .
`` The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market , '' said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macro Economics .
But the financial markets all over the world zuckten together late last month , after China had abgewertet its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 16 % below its peak in May , as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drosseln global growth .
Something the market has recovered in this month , with the Dow is now up almost 10 % below the high of last May .
For the Fed representatives should influence the market turbulence of the complex calculation , when to increase rates .
`` If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred , it would attract the reins in this session , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve .
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get to grips with the impact better .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , '' Oliner said .
None of the Fed 's main concerns is the health of the global economy , so they should be involved in their decisions not technically .
But in the end , the Fed 's monetary authority in the world .
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
The mere hint of Ben S. Bernanke then leader in 2013 that the Fed could reduce their monetäre expansion `` Vere , '' triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined with each other , that they not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks can be expected from the Fed representatives and experts advise that in order to get a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision is `` more art than science , '' said Zachary Kara Bell , head of global strategy for the asset management of the firm Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA. , said this month that `` the Fed has a history of excessive reactions to market movements , which apparently are not associated with the fundamental economic data . ''
Lacker , a voting berechtigtes de uses for an interest rate increase , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings `` despite begrenzter erkennbarer impact on growth in the United States , '' Lacker said .
A year later , these cuts made the Fed chief .
The Fed should set only during a severe crisis as the market collapse in 2008 in the first place aspects of financial stability , said Adam S. Posen , a former member of the Committee for the Bank of England to set interest rates .
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level , he said .
`` You will certainly not get in the situation in which she has said fear of a rate increase , because the markets '' aufregen , poses , President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not mentioned Finanzstabilität , and until that is changed , I do not think they should rush ahead of time .

BBC should abandon East Enders , former boss of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop to send programs such as East Enders and The Voice . `` He said that commercial rivals '' would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs , which are not sent by other UK broadcasters .
He criticised the BBC for public legal programs , which is likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in controversial Zeitfenster hard against the most popular shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4 .
After the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , told Johnson that he is six years into his time at Channel 4 have tried without success to get in touch with the BBC .
`` I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes commissioned or sends the Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry on the future of the BBC , which would also clearly demonstrated by not subventionierten rivals , '' Johnson said .
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not think the medium or long term is a good idea , you should at least give its production to programs that others do not , or commissioned .
You send The Voice in einem erstklassigen Zeitfenster , because they want to reach as broad a support for their future .
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous , it is , of course , nonsense .
Johnson said : `` I do not see why a regressive tax to fund programs that could be funded without Subventionen .
The voice is such a program , East Enders is another zugegebenermaßen both own product ions .
Frankly , other channels would give their right arm for .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public and legal television .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a serial entrepreneur , Channel 4 ran from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for the chase for ratings , `` due to the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long term support . ''
His comments on the most popular shows of the BBC give that back to what Tony Ball , the former head of Sky in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East Enders .
Johnson said that the programs rather public service `` should go to BBC4 , where you can pretty much do not measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue that if they go to their pseudo saints missions to justify broadcasting fees of £4 billion , '' Well , of course , we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. ``
You put them in a Zeitfenster in which no one ever wanted to see them .
For broadcasting fee , Johnson told the committee : `` I urge you to find a more objective recourse system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
Of course , you all think we all think that we are receiving a great value for £150 per year here , but for those who wonder is £150 for a lot of money , whether that is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
The former Sky- and Channel 5 boss David Elstein , aussagte also before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to `` inform , to form and maintain . ''
He said that only a little of the BBC production would now officially klassifiziert as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of public service television in Australia and Canada , this change to `` inform , educate and entertain . ''
On the question of Partnerschaften Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , he said that only a handful of which will be shown on television , and with the commercial broadcasters say alliances to make everything available online .

For slightly overweight diabetic weight loss surgery may be helpful .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who received non-surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data take a long time to show something , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert in weight loss surgery , wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery .
Weight Loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
Reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
Over the years , have obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes proved to be efficient , but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
If you want to calculate your BMI : 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv .
the researchers from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study in 2007 used for the new study and compare between two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans who were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
Meanwhile , the BMI remained at those non-surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal in 29th
Among those who underwent surgery , the diabetes disease broke up at 36 % completely and 28 % partially .
In the medically treated group of diabetic dissolved compared to fully only in one percent and partial only about two percent .
Moreover , the results in the checks of blood pressure , triglycerides and `` bad '' LDL cholesterol were `` generally better in the 'surgical ' group , '' the authors found .
The researchers also monitored the patient 's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c reflects blood sugar levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
After surgery , the average hemoglobin A1c decreased level of around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group remained however stable at about 8 percent .
But this better `` glycemic control '' - how is reflected in the level of hemoglobin A1c improved - did not reduce mortality in five years , so the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , the bypass surgery group had compared to the gastrectomy group lost more weight ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , achieved greater decreases in BMI ( 7.4 versus 5.1 ) and hemoglobin A1c ( 3 , 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and showed more of a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.9 % vs. 16.7 % ) .
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Blackstone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
In the Swedish study was obese people an obesity surgery underwent , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 , who are interested in the process .
`` This is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower '' , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start weight to be taken seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BMI 27 to 30
`` I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that their bodies with obesity and diabetes firmly connected , a reversal is really hard. ``

it was also clear that `` it needs clear signals '' , said the Minister .
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not on the Austrian-Slovenian border .
It needs a controlled approach .

The Croatian government said earlier also Slovenia would have to travel further incoming refugees toward Austria and Germany and also build corridors for refugees under certain circumstances .
Quite so did not see the interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana , however .
The idea of corridors was `` absolutely unacceptable '' , Slovenia would rather the monitoring of the border - mainly to Hungary - intensify .
The border with Croatia was however already heavily controlled as external border of the Schengen area .
As the Minister stressed Slovenian will thus not seal off its borders to refugees .
`` Each EU member has to complete its obligations , otherwise the system can not work , '' said Györkös Znidar .
As the Croatian Government announced that the first refugees had already tried during the night of Tuesday , at the border crossing Tovarnik / Sid enter in eastern Croatia past to avoid the registry .

Thus , it could now actually the observers already predicted shift of the recent Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary come to a slightly more westerly route .
Croatia : `` Comprehensive facilities for border control ''

It would not currently involve very high number of refugees .
One could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However , private Hungarian refugee helpers have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps showing alternate routes are marked by Croatia .

Jewelry instead curtain - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
Previously it was the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen about making meters .
The embroidered fabrics and laces created in large quantity for customers who , for example , further processed into blankets and curtains .
That alone does not work today , explains Andreas Reinhardt , CEO of Fashion lace Plauen .
Instead , the fashion is important again .
In the early days of Plauen lace fashion played a greater role , was then supplanted by the home textiles industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt gives some examples : peak in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
Ever forms the so-called vintage fashion , inspired by past eras , an increasing order potential .
Anyone using any niche in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market .
We already account for half of all orders .
Fashion tip Plauen together with nine other companies member of the industry association Plauen lace and embroidery .
Only they may bear the protected label .
In the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales are broken .
Private shops and wholesalers , there are almost no more .
Our products reach the customer in this way any more .
The commodity being manufactured much cheaper nowadays in Asia and sold almost exclusively via chains .
Moreover schwächle Export , currently in Russia and in the USA .
Ample reasons for new ways .
The industry association tries to score points by environmental awareness , as explained Cordula Bauer of Stickperle in Falkenstein : `` This year we are introducing a seal of quality that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible '' .
Reinhardt adds : `` This also applies to the materials used . ''
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at Schneeberger branch of Zwickau University - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace .
To counter the competition from Asian something , you need to find quality and innovative products .
This takes time and courage .
This creates a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies who have to think economically , especially , `` says Schmidt .
Therefore , an existing design will often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
Some years ago a busy textile designer Kati Reuter historical snowball top new .
The machine embroiders small balls in some places .
Plauener goldsmith Bianca Hallenbach-Krauße was inspired them : `` Before I could with traditional Plauener Spitze do anything '' .
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry .
In a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
`` Many people in the region identify with the theme Plauen lace - young and old , '' said Reuter .
It also provides in the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a keepsake .

Townhouses for refugees , single parents , low income
The companies and Markus Gildner builds in Middle Franconia Eckental detached for people who do not have much money .
So as for refugees - but also as a signal : `` Not only refugees need Wohnhraum , but also the single mother and the low paid . ''
`` I 'll show how to build low and well even today , '' the 44-year-old said in an interview
Thousands of refugees are entering the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly affordable housing can be created : He builds in a project Townhouse for refugees .
Mr. Gildner , many refugees are entering the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The mass housing in containers or gyms has no sustainability .
Because people remain to a large extent here .
Given the influx of refugees , we need enough housing in the coming decades .
A very banal , three-storey townhouse is the solution .
Gildner : A detached needs the least space .
It facilitates integration .
This is different when one brings people into residential blocks .
Each of the six houses that are built just in the pilot project , consists of three units , each for four asylum seekers .
Each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
Then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
How high are the costs ?
Gildner : The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 EUR , excluding land .
That 's manageable .
Six months lasted the construction .
That 's reasonable .
Do the building codes complicates their plans ?
Gildner : building laws I pulled my project properly .
Particularly complicated is making it increasingly the threatening sword of Damocles Sonderbau and Pitch Regulation .
Creepy .
It is still assumed , who creates in a detached three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
Only in cities lacking for the place .
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
How did the residents respond to her townhouse project ?
Gildner : There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
What definitely not true .
But do not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : It is true but we had in the last five years a construction boom in Germany but were constructed luxury apartments that hardly anyone can afford longer .
My project has the message , even the ordinary people need housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low paid .
I show how to build low and well even today .
It 's all about this .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyzes .

They carry the spectacular creations of French designer , which has been used with Madonna 's stage outfits to big star of the fashion scene - and the fact that he put men in skirts .
`` I can no longer say that I am , the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair . ''
`` Earlier it was bleached , now it 's real , '' Gaultier said .
For visitors to the exhibition `` From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk '' ( From the sidewalk to the catwalk ) , which can be seen on 18 September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the couturier its initially dismissive attitude has changed to a show about his person .
Actually , he was against it , because : `` For me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , '' he said .
When you die , you come to the museum .
The impressive collection had previously done this in Montreal and in Paris station .
`` It 's about so much more than just beautiful clothes , '' the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Diederen said .
This is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhibits give an insight into the barely over-looking work of the man , the fashion history wrote , without ever having received training .
Chronologically , the exhibition is not built up , but it is a perfectly choreographed Gesamtkunstwerk , for much effort has been made : to comb the dolls , specially a stylist for example , was committed .
14 tons of material have carted according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich the makers .
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest a special treat was still in the process : a leather pants outfit with corset .
Heidi meets Madonna .
He had always been interested in strong women ( `` women are smarter than men '' ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaultier said .
Also Gaultier old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
It represents the first , tentative fashionable baby steps of the designer .
As a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he had his teddy dressed bras and dresses , Gaultier said .
Playing with a puppet , his parents would not allow him .
Designing fashion he had later taught himself .
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the other designers such as Gaultier told in Munich .
Later I then but of course bought .
For his first fashion show he had the models can not pay .
They got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .

Robot cars : government wants leading role for Germany
Germany is the intention of the federal government to be the transformation of the car a technological pioneer .
The Federal Cabinet approved a strategy paper from the home of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which provides , inter alia , investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure on Wednesday .
Dobrindt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the car show IAA by a `` new mobility era '' .
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less congestion , Dobrindt said .
He will also discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries , coming together at the IAA also with representatives of the industry .
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid shift to digital radio among others .
For testing of new technology is currently being built a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
Thus the driver `` are saddled with no additional liability risks '' , wants the federal government `` review and , where necessary , adapted to the new developments , '' the legal framework .
Thus , Germany will about international efforts to ensure that the maximum speed limit for self-propelled cars will be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
The federal government also wants to work for a change of the Vienna Convention , which provides far only humans as drivers .
When automated driving takes increasingly the car , the guide , the driver will be more and more to the passenger .
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture and process the data in seconds the environment .
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy highly automated driving on highways by 2020 be technically possible .
Nevertheless are driverless vehicles `` to be expected until well after 2020 '' on public roads .
The value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany appreciate the authors of the study in 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
`` The cars of digital networking can lead to increased safety and efficiency on the road , '' said the SPD politician traffic Sören Bartol .
The issue of liability in case of accidents and the security of personal data , the driver must be clarified , however .
Yet look at the German self-propelled cars , however , skeptical - much more than the French or Americans .
A study presented on Wednesday at the AA survey by the Forsa Institute commissioned by the testing organization Dekra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent expected before 20 years thus , 31 percent believe not in it .
In France expect 21 percent of respondents to 2025 with an autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
Anyway , the car drivers are not ready to completely rely on a self-propelled vehicle in Germany .
According to a survey of digital association Bitkom only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout their travel on all roads .
On the highway itself could imagine at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , in traffic 45 percent .
Good one in four would leave the car in control under any circumstances .

He admitted that the searches were performed on the computer from him , but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare predators .
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
He said that he did it to lure them .
He said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and said he would then see images of rape and murder .
Ms Robertson added : `` When the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was trembling and the wines .
then you saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Hogg , 23 , Ward Road , Dundee , declared guilty to the indictment , to have taken indecent images of children on June 14 , last year , to have violated on 25 January this year against the pads and not in court for a hearing to be published on 24 March this year .

Fourfold increase in intake of hand sanitizer by children in last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , the swallow strong alcoholic hand disinfectants , the Georgia Poison Center .
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , director of the Georgia Poison Center , the cases of revenue of hand disinfectants increased in children under 12 years , the poison control centers report from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in , 2014 .
`` Children are increasingly being used in these products , and unfortunately lands a percentage of them go to the emergency room , '' Lopez told CNN .
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a dare in social media .
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectant only because of a cheap experience .
Youths have reportedly mixed disinfectant containing alcohol mouthwash to get tougher drink .
Younger children can be lured by attractive scents of disinfectant .
`` A child does not think that this is bad for it , '' said Lopez .
Many of the more attractive ( hand disinfectants ) are those that are perfumed .
There are disinfectants with strawberry , the grape and orange scent that is very appealing to children .
Hand sanitizer somewhere contain 45-95 percent alcohol .
Especially in infants few splashes can already lead to alcohol poisoning .
`` It is highly concentrated alcohol , '' said Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the poison control center at the hospital of the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in Kansas City .
So , you would not be standing around sip whiskey , but people leave these hand sanitizers out of reach of children , and when children come to it , it 's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six year old girl who had recently taken four splashes of scented of strawberry hand sanitizer at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
Your blood alcohol concentration was 179 times higher than the threshold , the legally deemed drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency room doctor who treated them at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
Nhaijah slurred her words and was not able to go when she arrived at the emergency room .
Doctors monitored overnight in a separate children 's hospital for signs of brain injury , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and his head had encountered , Ritchey said .
`` It was very scary , '' said Scott Ortoria , Nhaijahs mother CNN .
It could have been fatal for my child .
Lopez has parents and teachers recommended to use alcohol-free products or disinfecting wipes and store hand sanitizer out of reach of the child .
About alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants were associated with deaths .
In 2013 , two women women died in Ontario after swallowing of hand disinfectants , containing a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
Public health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol , a lethal solution rather than ethyl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient .
In January planned three students of the fourth class in New York State , to poison their `` mean '' teacher by interpreted antibacterial products around the classroom `` , it emits a police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banished her from her room .
The police looked at the foiled plan as `` chatter '' and referred to disciplinary action at the school board .

'Sonogenetics ' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction in the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves .
Change the tiny nematode , the direction in the moment in which they are using sound pulses which have for the human ear to high frequencies to be heard , irradiated .
The pulses work by switching on of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves .
More on this topic : Read researchers and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method , called Sonogenetics , can be used in the ultrasound to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the method could one day replace the depth brain stimulation , an invasive procedure , the electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease gives ,
Nematodes usually respond not on ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles .
The bubbles , he found out that amplify the ultrasonic waves , which then penetrate the worms .
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures that TRP-4-called ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
The sound waves cause the opening of ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , according to a report Nature Communications .
To provide ultrasound-guided nematodes , altered genetically Chalasani the worms so that carry some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels .
If he uses ultrasound to changing creatures that sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the amended motoneurons .
The method has some similarities with Opto Genetics , a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists neurons switched with pulses of light on and off .
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
Unlike light , which must be sent down an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissue without hindrance and can be sent from the top of the skull into the brain .
`` We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , '' Chalasani said .
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells , he added .

halved Hillary Clinton 's lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll : Election-2016
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her over ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 percent previously ) , while Sanders is in second place , with 27 percent ( up 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries .
More than five months before the primaries , say most Democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion , it is clear which candidate they will support .
But Clinton 's supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates in their choice .
Since the CBS News poll has Clinton at a number of demographic groups lost while Sanders scored some gains .
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates , but those projections have decreased .
Your support for men has dropped significantly , and Sanders is lagging behind with only 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage in Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now at the same level .
However , Clinton still has a big lead among older voters .
Last month , Clinton was before Sanders double-digit lead in the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group .
About half of Democratic voters say the primaries nationwide that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she nominated by the party .
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support only because it is the candidate .
Six percent would not support .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton 's current supporters are particularly impressed by it .
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it enthusiastically .
While 48 percent of Democratic voters primaries say they support Clinton enthusiastically , say less Republican voters this via their top candidate Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
If Clinton 's supporters will be asked in an open question as to why they want to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they did ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time the right experience that a woman President ( 13 percent ) and that they are the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) is .
From Clinton 's supporters also their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is mentioned .
Approval for dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited .
As the vice president casts a potential run for president in the balance , want to see him in the race , 57 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries - although one third believes that he should not do it .
If democratic voters the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , is Biden at the top .
From Clinton 's supporters say more than half that Biden would be their second choice long before Sanders .
Biden opts not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton increases lead over Sanders , 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the election ; However , this figure of 78 percent has fallen in the past month .
Biden is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage who sees him as the `` wählbarsten '' , has risen .
Nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , call Democratic voters questions about eligibility .
Similar to last month stands not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters primaries emerged as unacceptable .
The Democratic candidate or potential candidate give good results in some important traits in voters of their party primaries .
Majorities consider Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills .
Biden cuts in the three candidate came out on top with honesty while Clinton 's strength is leadership .
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic voters primaries see also generally Clinton , Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views .
In all of these measurements has about a quarter of Democratic voters no opinion of Sanders .
Since questions about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the tenure as Secretary of State continue to be made , most Democratic voters the primaries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has their opinions in total not affected .
But there is another story in the American public as a whole .
Half of Americans is now unhappy with their statement , while only about a third is satisfied .
Public opinion this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light split .
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsened by it .
There are mainly Republicans , more than six in 10 who say that their views of Clinton have worsened .
Although Clinton is viewed by voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : they see only 32 percent as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the electorate do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time see 55 percent of the electorate nationally and Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy to .
Clinton and Trump , however , receive good grades executive .
Of the six candidates tested cutting Biden , Carson and Bush came out on top with honesty .
A majority sees Sanders rather than honest , but as with many Carson have no opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .

This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming , and the bull market will falter , bond yields will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
We know this .
What we do not know how long all this and how long it will last .
In particular , has the history of the economy little guidance on the conduct .
A recession came within just 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months .
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems respond .
Therefore , representatives of the US Federal Reserve have so vigorously emphasized that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates , but rather on the period which is needed for normalization .
In fact , several variables play a role .
However , at the end of market participants might find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated for a rate increase .
`` The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably by some as a signal for the end of the era of '' `` be interpreted '' cheap money , said Julian Jessop , chief economist at Capital Economics , in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights , but still at too low level to cause seismic shock , many seem to fear .
This does not mean that there will be no impact .
Here is a based on historical trends look at how some sectors of the economy might react :
As the market has seen in the past month , the anticipation of rate hikes can make things for a while volatile .
Once the increase is received , the effect is not as dramatic .
`` There seems to be a tendency that investment income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase be stalled , perhaps again reflecting the delay in monetary policy , '' said German Bank analysts in a recent study to what happened after rate hikes by the Fed ,
More specifically , the market is in the last 35 years mostly on the rise - about 14 percent - on the way to raise interest rates fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with an average yield over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis , published Bob Doll , chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset management in Barron 's .
The German bank said that the impact on the stocks tend to occur later in the cycle and increase the yield begins to decrease .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes they promote often .
In the current case , the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
Most notable here is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point will be at a rate hike by the Fed .
According to German Bank nominal GDP stood at the 118 rate hikes since 1950 only twice under 4.5 percent .
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , expect just that this will continue and expected for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 percent .
Increases in interest rates at such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question , `` whether this time is different , '' the German bank said .
Market participants have made throughout the year in for a rate hike by the Fed , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could authorize an increase in this session , the futures trading shows only a probability of 25 percent .
`` In our study , all increase cycles have occurred from 1950 to the present in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs made very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shadows '' , the report said .
In contrast , this is a unique slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed period .
The current cycle is by far the longest , the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
The fixed income was volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
The main difference is that the effect of bond is faster than stocks when the change its strategic course .
For bonds , yields seem to change direction when the first increase / reduction is performed in the cycle .
At the end of the cycle increasing bond yields fall immediately , the German bank said .
The strategist with Charles Schwab believe that the rise will result in interest rates means that yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve .
High yield bonds often bring in such a climate better yields , although `` we are careful not to expect higher returns , '' said Kathy Jones , fixed-income analyst at Schwab , in an analysis .
Interestingly , Jones said that the markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , '' she wrote .
Short term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market , when the Fed tightened their strategy .
By and large , are companies which conduct a large proportion of their business in the United States , benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive .
Multinational companies with large debts are worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market as well as to finance their debt .
`` History shows that '' quality `` stocks tend to respond very positively three months after an initial rate hike , '' said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report to clients .
Companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded company with weak balance after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points .
Companies with high capital returns and lower volatility in their shares outperformed their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 each ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debts are a major problem .
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , Goldman said .
Outside of pure equity Games consumers will also benefit by the rising dollar .
Savers could see profits through higher yields , although experts disagree on how quickly this will take place .

But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data in question and pointed out the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the `` extremely windy basis '' on which PHE explained his main conclusion .
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked if the allegations `` are based on rock or sand . ''
Martin McKee , Professor of European Öffentlichde Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies on the demonstration of efficacy is based should . ''
They said that the public expects the assertion of PHE that `` is the current best estimate that e-cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking , '' is based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling .
In fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who have been called to a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis ( Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA ) to develop to their opinions about the harms of various nicotine containing products to result in a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting a company called Euro Swiss Health was its CEO earlier by British American Tobacco Central ( BAT ) should have received for an independent study .
He also wrote the references of BAT for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants said the meeting , to obtain funds from an e-cigarette manufacturers , but not the financing , he is said to have previously obtained , according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not supplied , but can include several well-known E-Cigarette Champions , some of which specify an industry financing in the paper .
Some other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
At the meeting , the tobacco pipe of PHE participated .
The research group `` admits characteristically '' that there is a lack of `` hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria , '' wrote McKee and Capewell .
However , none of these compounds or limitations in the PHE report is discussed .
McKee and Capewell said that the allegations of PHE that `` so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are used as a way to smoke for children or Non smoking '' were premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , Director of Health and Welfare at PHE , said that has already responded to the allegations of BMJ previously .
He said : `` E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . ''
Every second lifetime smokers die of his addiction .
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison to , but that we continue to study the long-term effects .
PHE has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence is and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco .
Almost 80,000 people die every year from an illness related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ per year .
The clear presenting of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking represent , we fulfill our national responsibility .

The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestor of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called informer .
This property combines many also with the billionaire who wants to become US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for Aufreger .
Whether he xenophobic remarks , journalists As rude or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy disclosed - the candidates for the US presidency swirls campaigning vigorously on .
And scores well here .
That is also registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt , where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate .
The New Yorker with Föhnfrisur many is a term in the wine-producing village on the wine trail .
Many in the 1200-inhabitant city is akin over tens corners with him .
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz : Donald Trump , here in the campaign mode .
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump .
And what do the villagers about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I think the following is somehow exciting , but are in their Kallstadter kind not so deeply impressed , '' says Simone Wendel .
Born Kallstädterin has an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring rotated , which is next to Trump the ketchup Heinz family .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , comes in `` Kings of Kallstadt '' ( 2014 ) also have their say - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Kallstadt .
For king of hearts he did not put there .
Whereas there is respect for the work of the family , but also tend to think that Trump `` has a bit of a loudmouth '' was said Wendel .
Coincidentally loud the nickname Kallstadt have within , `` The Brulljesmacher '' - to High German : the informer , she says .
So Trump comes from the village of informers .
The Trump'sche success story began in 1885 , emigrated when the future grandfather and the United States opened a place for gold mining .
Cornerstone of the real estate group were first land purchases in New York .
But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy : Your desire to return permanently in the home , was denied by the Bavarian State to which the Palatinate then belonged .
He had Trump not included because it was once cut down without permission , the Director of the Institute for Palatinate History and Folklore , Roland Paul had declared the film 's release .
Trump is the grandson of `` illegal immigrant '' .
This is in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of descendants .
He had repeated derogatory talk about Mexican immigrants in the United States and the construction of a border wall required to deter illegal immigrants .
`` Just as the rumbles , is not so appealing , '' says Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant relative Trumps ( `` The grandmother was born Trump , the grandfather was born Heinz '' ) .
The winemaker retired sees the Americans rather distant , `` he is always so short-tempered '' .
Does he believe that Trump is not ?
`` I can not imagine , '' says the 72-year-old .
`` He has never cared about Kallstadt '' .
The landlady Veronika Schramm mentioned some Kallstadter that a descendant of the Heinz family something donated during a visit to the church organ , which arrived in general good .
`` I can not imagine the Donald , '' says the 68-year-old .
They think it would be better if he did not gain the election because `` who has such radical views , I do not know if that 's good . ''
If those in the United States were in charge at the time of his grandfather , would have been like him , `` he would be there even never arrived '' .
`` There are more interesting subjects than him , '' says winemaker daughter Sarah Buhler .
And as president ?
`` My President , it 's not , '' she says .
And : `` The grapes are ripe , even without the President Trump '' .
Wendel 's film , was interviewed for the Trump long have seen 12,000 moviegoers in the US wakes up the interest .

Certainly David Cameron The Lorax knows better ?
It is one thing to learn all parents soon : If your child likes a book , it will not be long before you know it almost by heart .
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems , to name his favorite children 's book , the Prime Minister of The Lorax , in 1971 published environmental fable by Dr. Seuss decided .
It was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super Camps , and continues : `` funny , touching , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read to my children , because it always seems to give an image or message that we 've been missing. ``
All well and good , except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , instead a synopsis of the film version of 2012 reflects that added new characters and details to enhance the rather short original .
`` In the midst of the walled city Thneed-Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , hoping a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win the girl of his dreams by to see their desire to have a real tree takes place , `` one reads . A love interest was Dr. Seuss , whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and in 1991 died , but completely unknown .
As if that was not suspicious enough would be : The plan submitted by Cameron text reads in part as the summary of the Lorax movie , which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : `` In the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hoping a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win the girl of his dreams. ``
Although he admits so , to be a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron the plot of the book is so unfamiliar . Here ends an unnamed boy , as the local environment by greedy , trees felling , thneed knitting Once-ler is despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax , a squatting , mustachioed creatures , `` speaking on behalf of the Trees '' , devastated .
Most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been delegated to a helper who Lorax has not 20 times consecutively read a child .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron 's constituency office .
Super Camps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron 's employees , but gave no further immediate comment .

Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm surrounding his friend nick kyrgios and earned the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy believes more praise than criticism for his own behavior .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo , who is repeatedly referred to as `` Special K , '' fell through the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
In a fiery qualifier in Cincinnati soon after Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee , said Harrison exclaimed , `` Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios , and I should beat the child . ''
While he was last seen , as he smashed a racket after a spasm foiled a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis was defended staunchly Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain .
`` One thing about which I quite envious me is the fact that in my opinion a little Thanasi was drawn into the dispute , '' said Healy .
He has a bat shattered when he lost because of a spasm in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a racket in frustration with himself , and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud .
But , really , he did extremely well behaved in the US Open , even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves much credit .
He has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little treat too strict .
He is a very mature 19-year-old , he works very hard , and it fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in the dressing area , he trains hard , he is good in form , it is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits .
Healy also supported the decision Kyrgios not be included for the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the `` joint decision '' as a right for all , but it affords the man from Canberra to , as a long-term integral part of the team return. ``
`` First , we want that the team is fully focused on competition and not to all the controversies around [ Kyrgios ] , '' said Healy .
And I believe that Nick has very quickly managed to climb what people like Federer and Murray have pointed . He rises in the public eye , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we will try to support him , we try to make him the consequences of his actions understandable . Some time away from the spotlight , where he can only think about it , I think that 's right , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .

The Proposed referendum on United Kingdom membership of the European Union-bearing ( Proposed referendum on United Kingdom membership of the European Union = withdrawal of Britain from the EU ) could gain in feed when the economy is up to 2017 in the doldrums
David Cameron 's half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will fall every day deeper in trouble even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy `` Is it yes or no ? '' Corbyn the leader of Labour or the TUC , the violently quarreled for Europe on Tuesday .
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farage .
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States , so deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU , it is now time and not always their own fault , Britain created Agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes , they usually do not want to be sick ,
In Brighton the TUC decided at their annual meeting that they also do not like when they threaten social protection .
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance climbing summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
It is always about me .
My European friend who wants a-sighted outside Britain inside the EU tent - `` Let us not only with France , '' says Berlin - and lets slip that more and come more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals to the point are , where they do not care whether we stay or go .
Germany cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she 's 10 years in power and wants to leave the office before it bad for her looks as in the exaggerated long persevering as Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and carbon ( 16 ) is done .
France François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017th
He is also a fading force .
Poland may soon a nationalist right-wing government , a left Spain .
It is hard to imagine that they will bend over backwards to help the Selfie-British , whose power would be better used for preventing Scotland exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
Therefore , you may plan some such ministers even deliberately unhelpful comments , quite the SNP-style , while Britain 's referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Proposed referendum on United Kingdom membership of the European Union process , suspected my friend .
`` The renegotiation was a disaster '' and `` Britain has not won anything of value from the renegotiation . ''
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be on their costs and what Eurosceptics is the oligarchy of the press barons , as they did not had it during inspired by Tony Benn referendum in 1975 that our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 supported .
You can faintly remember Boris Johnson , the ore-Euro-opportunist who has made a name for himself as an `` EU-straight bananas ' Brussels correspondent in the early 90s .
For all his madness knew Ed Miliband , who were his enemies .
This included the medley of tax-fearing villains Phone chopping foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers .
Actually Tony Blair thought similarly about them , but noted that , if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage , you better bananas distributed to distract him , instead of being to his lunch , and dinner .
In fact , Miliband was more Blairianer as Blair himself when he Camerons referendum vertebrae opposed because Blair had put the principle about not adopted the EU constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , giving it thus a backdoor opened .
The press has also never forgave him .
But the cute Jeremy Corbyn , the Westminster a friendly pat on the back gave me on Monday - I told him that he need not waste any more time for me - seems in danger , Neil Kinnock boycott Murdoch strategy 80s to repeat a mistake then and now .
It may take time , but it must develop a coherent strategy to attract the media , not to me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , the BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyns official position on Europe is - I press it times out nicely - in development .
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
Now , most people outside Ukips traditional blue dye trend and the wilder realms of Torys small Engländerismus can say yes to each well .
It 's what Hilary `` A Benn , but not a Bennite '' Benn said this week on radio and television , as the Scouts fought in it , not admitting that Corbyns appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 70 's , when his old father on television therefore tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his Cabinet job .
Hilary 's fight was even more attractive .
But to fight to stay `` under all circumstances '' - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said , nor what JC told his fellow MPs and by all accounts at their meeting on Monday evening .
Whatever wants to convey the sentimental bottom-up Image Corbyn - remember that he has stirred even me - Message discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock important and , above all , in the vortex of social media a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe , which allowed him to keep Labour 's support in the referendum campaign for granted , like McDonnell said it .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that .
But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguities towards EU membership - in accordance with its Bennite siege economy , its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents , for the narcissism of small difference , a central tenet of dogmatic disputes .
As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC does not start a campaign for the exit - will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superiors at home foreign diplomats .
Why should Paris or Berlin political capital waste , - they have a mistrustful voters - to make concessions to the British , if anything can be meaningless ?
The US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in cost of the Tory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something British Influence Security Forum called ,

8 polls , which show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously .
Some have tried to brand him as a flop .
Others have dismissed it as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw Donald Trump of the top ranks in surveys down , it has not ( yet ) does not work .
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump result in double figures , and begin some to seriously ask what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul .
Of course , it is too early in the election period .
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts emphasize that at this time Rick Perry 's leadership has been delivered to the ascending Herman Cain in 2011 , of which none won only one state in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
But outsider groups as Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps perseverance and begin to make their dollars flowing to overthrow him .
Here are some current poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase :
Trumps popularity ratings have rotated 180 degrees .
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a survey showed the Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive .
By mid-July , there were 40 percent .
In early August , it was 52 percent .
Now , six out of 10 Republicans a positive view of Donald Trump .
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
And these numbers hold in early states .
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa has found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump .
Two-thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates .
In a survey conducted by CNN / ORC last week said 67 percent of Republicans , they were either `` enthusiastic '' or `` satisfied '' if Trump would nominated .
Only two out of 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Carson manages approximately the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 per cent say they would be `` delighted '' vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump ) .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
On the other hand say 47 percent of Republican voters that they were `` dissatisfied '' or `` angry '' if Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate would .
A majority of Republicans do not see Trumps temperament problem .
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for its bombastic and insulting statements , believe 52 percent of tending to the Republicans Irish voters that the real estate mogul had the right temperament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
The same number applies to the first code state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander , according to Quinnipiac last week .
Nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his duties , and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
If they put their scholarly hats , holding Republican voters Trump for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , say , after a survey by CNN / ORC from last week 's four out of ten that Trump is the best bet .
This is a change from the time when four out of ten end of July put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past .
At this point in the last cycle covered four out of ten Republicans that Rick Perry would win the nomination , compared with only 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
Nevertheless , shows that a plurality of GOP voters Trumps campaign regarded as plausible .
Even if Republicans rallied to another candidate , Trump still beats almost everyone .
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trumps lead , while the anti-Trump-Support is diffusely distributed on more than a dozen other candidates .
But a survey of Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump reaps the majority support .
He plans Carly Fiorina 13 points clear , before Marco Rubio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally against Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points .
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race .
A slight majority of Donald Trump fans says they have formed their opinion .
A new poll by CBS / NYT shows on Tuesday that just over half of voters that support Trump , say that they have their voices permanently assigned .
Of course , much can be done to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to another candidate .
Nevertheless Trumps strongest competitors at the moment the other outsiders , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as likely for Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration .
Since Donald Trump `` rapist '' called in his campaign speech two months ago , immigrants from Mexico , immigration was linchpin in public discourse to 2016th
Some are concerned that the bombastic phraseology of Trump decisive Hispanics will keep away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts .
But according to the new ABC / Post poll Monday said six of 10 Republicans , to coincide with Trump in immigration issues .
So long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it is Donald Trump do apparently .
The frustration with the government climbed to new highs .
now on Donald Trump and Ben Carson accounted for half of the support of Republican voters , especially through their outsider status .
Six out of 10 Republicans say the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they would rather a political outsider as someone with government experience .
And they are also angry at Washington .
A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent `` dissatisfied '' and 21 percent `` hellishly angry '' .

'American Ninja Warrior ' crowned first Champion
Professional sports climbers and busboy Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete of the American Ninja Warrior won on Monday night and the Grand Prize of $ 1 million took home .
The competition show , which just completed its seventh season , had never seen a competition participant , who was able to complete all the steps of his obstacle course .
During the season finale made it two men , Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten , to the finals .
For the last task climbing belonged to a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Britten finished the task within the time which he was the first athlete who completed the grueling phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . However Caldiero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Caldiero spoke with E ! News after the hard-fought victory , still under the shock of winning the grand prize of $ 1 million .
`` I mean , it 's amazing to think about it , I 've never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , '' Isaac said E ! over his pile of money .
So all of a sudden .. I can not even imagine what it 's like ... the future is unknown to me .
The executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter , to discuss the finale and why Britten , although he was the first ever finished the course , does not receive any prize money .
According to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
`` If there is more than one finalist , it is replaced by one with the fastest time , '' Weed said .
How much money is a wonderful price and life changing , he receives the great bonus .
I do not think that he also harbors some resentment .
He is to have just done so happy that he did .
Masses of awards he received from fans .
He 's such a great guy and a family man .
He is a hero for his children and his wife .
Geoff said to me : `` If I should be beaten by someone , then I 'm glad it 's Isaac . ''
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had reversed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in the spring 2016th

Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice , saying that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 `` up converts '' to Classic FM , says a leading member of parliament and raised new pressure on the sender to prove that he is doing something that the private broadcasters do .

`` And the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and give new works , I really think this is important , '' he said .
Earlier this year , argued BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey that harder must be worked to engage the audience , as it did so in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
However , Radio 3 was not the only member of the BBC production which it fell during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture , Media and Sport under fire , the commercial rival to step on their feet .
The Tory MPs Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show by the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
See a why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced `` in a special BBC-way '' .
He added that he wished that the company `` a hit from our own barn find '' when it next time Create an entertainment series .
However , he refused to rule out the appointment of another series of The Voice in the future or spend money the fee payer for other entertainment formats .

Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
Eleven years ago I pulled a self-forgetful 19-year-old in a college dorm , still believing in berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I have gotten - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about other ,
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules .
The move into student residences ranges from slightly unnerving to absolutely terrifying .
It is tempting to talk : tell people where you come from , if and where you took sabbatical where you stand in terms of Corbyn and why you `` honestly Marmite neither love nor hate , because seriously , guys , it 's just a yeast extract HAHAHA , I 'm in my room. ``
Breathe .
And you help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
It directs the conversation and helps you find the people you love , as opposed to those with whom you would not talk , even if your lashes caught fire and this fire extinguisher would .
Let people .
The rooms of people transform themselves often in drinks receptions , movie night venues and local meeting places , but they are also the places where people get dressed and straighten her underwear .
Then based : Do not think to start at the university with a relationship
Introverts get a rough treatment at the University .
Your room should be a refuge , but many halls of residence form a room-to-room spree culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life-long friendship .
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
Nothing in the culture allows you to say `` I like you , and I want our friendship goes on , but you have to go away for me to get back the energy that I have used for interacting with you . ''
Try to feel when a fellow student of socializing is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking .
knock Speaking : Do it .
A guy in my halls of residence had the idea that a non-locked door was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Make friends by baking .
As you begin university at the peak of the back-mania , is knocking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brownies , less strange as the greeting of the 1950s `` Welcome to the neighborhood , I have you baked something . Well , now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions. ``
offer homemade treats is a great way to make friends .
Your roommate feel obliged to entertain themselves and so perhaps associate your face with a tasty morsel .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
Poorly mixed lumps of flour , sugar and fat cause people ask to be asleep when you knock .
stealing food , is a common crime in student dormitories .
Of course , the claws of chicken is a theft , but it is taking a drop of lactic your tea also ?
Check the milk with the owner .
Chances are that they say themselves to use , even if they cook inside .
If someone steals your stuff , that 's annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to make a balanced deal than my roommate , who added their milk a detergent to punish thieves .
She is now in jail .
You should not make any noise , the people from sleep or from work keeps .
It 's not just about being a decent human being , but you are in the truest sense of the saying to the people who sit in glass houses .
A girl on my hallway asked their neighbors if it makes them a little to make drum & bass a little quieter because there three in the morning , and she had a morning examination .
They responded with even louder music .
When she finally stopped at 5 am , they let their neighbors kindly sleep another two hours before they could blare their own music , completed her door and went to their three-hour examination .
Would not it romantic if your future spouse would happen to move in the same dorm ?
Conversely , it would not profoundly embarrassing when you hold a roommate for your future spouse to ranmachen them , separate again and they then have to see every day and perhaps witness how pulling them all together to be friends ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but when a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse , you at least try your abdomen persuade some reason .
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has leave his keys in his not locked room , the line between a joke and bullying is more subtle than it seems .
A good trick is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang .
Grant by hiding a valuable and entertaining lesson about safety - but you never screw up one 's room with toothpaste and shampoo .
Seal your door , and put their keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but you tackern their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice firmly .

Peter Moody claims that stewards were trying to spy on him and threatens to end the racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install last year a spy in his barns and threatened to finish the race immediately .
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Division of Racing Victoria , claiming that because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday , led by a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching Lady Tatai .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself found in difficult conditions , when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at Lidaris that he can not explain .
He had 18 months held back because of the spying allegations and did not want it `` look like too high hanging grapes . ''
`` I had planned nothing to say , and I have long been sitting on it , but sometimes you are so frustrated that all comes out at once , '' Moody said .
They know that it went on .
Sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I 'll go home tonight and sleep well .
I want his head held high walking around , and I want my owners think that I will try my best for them .
If they begin to think , I do not , then I should not be more coach .
I must then consider what I do with my license .
Previously , Moody had let off the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable .
`` Eighteen months ago , sat Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I 'll call when I 'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to information about what I within my stables do deliver `` Moody said on Racing.com .
They seem to believe that I 'm a cheater .
If that is the case , they should certainly hold their noses because they have in trying to contain myself , failed .
Robert Roulston , Former . Chairman of RVL , David Moodie , President of RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of RVL were aware of at the time and still are today .
If me bring to the view that it is personally ?
Has the RVL behave cowardly and maybe makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I so bad for the industry ?
Maybe people think out there , it 's me .
Maybe they need to take away my license and cast me , and I have no doubt that what I say , they can now think about it .
But I am now arrived at the point where I do not care , and that makes me sad .
That makes me really sad .
I will exert the pressure on them and urge them to come to a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The frustration level of the coach have built up with the long-term cobalt investigation at Lidari , and the Late Scratching meant that he said that he `` could take his license over the table . ''
Moody , best known for its preparation of an undefeated champion Black Caviar , called the Race Day-treatment rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or clay on the horse 's legs had been applied , which was against the rules .
`` It 's against the rules of racing .
I need it to take full responsibility , `` he said .
`` One of my employees has erroneously applied the mud on the leg .
It could have been so last night .
It had all day yesterday may be so , what was that way .
It had also so on race day .
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on race day . An investigation into this matter was opened .
It 's a joke .
People who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse .
`` We all have seen that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , '' Moody said .

At its most anticipated meeting in years Federal Reserve spend strategists two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table in order to decide whether it 's time for the first time in nearly a decade to raise the key interest rate .
Threatening is above them at one end of the ornate , two-story courtroom a mural of the United States .
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : keep maximizing US employment and prices here stable .
But since the great recession the Fed leaders recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
And this third mandate could be the X-factor is a decision that is too narrow to predict it . It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented stimulus by the lying close to zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008 .
Although most of the data of the economy show that it grows strong , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to strengthen this volatility by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and even if only by a quarter percentage point .
`` Obviously , the labor market and inflation will be the most important in the first place , what they watch , '' said Lindsey M. Piegza , chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co .
`` But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the rate of interest is the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justification to continue to wait , '' she said .
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do what insecure in themselves the financial market .
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week .
However , the financial markets expect the Fed Waiting , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
This points to a decline of the stock market , if the Fed increases the sentence , unless that strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4 % to 16,599.85 .
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time , `` he said .
If she does , `` she would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets , so they do not panic . ''
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm the financial markets , because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
A month ago , the Fed seemed on track to set to increase by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US .
Yellen had said in spring and early summer , that they that more economic progress would be needed this year , despite the complaints of liberals , expecting an increase in the rate .
Although the creation of jobs in August slowed , the improvement in the labor market has been solid this year .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed considers full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And although inflation constantly proceeded with the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , said the Fed 's representatives that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
The economy `` can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tightening of the labor market , '' said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
But the financial markets around the world jumped end together last month , after China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16 % below its peak , feared as investors that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would curb global growth .
The market has recovered slightly this month , the Dow is now up by almost 10 % below the May high .
For the Fed 's representatives the turmoil affecting the complex calculation when they should raise interest rates .
`` If the events in financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks had not occurred , it would in this session the reins tighten , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve .
He predicts that they 'll wait at least a month to get the effects better grip .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , '' said Oliner .
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed , so they should be technically involved in their decision making .
But in the end the Fed monetary authority in the world has become .
The influence of the central bank was enormously in recent years .
The mere statement of the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could `` narrow '' its monetary expansion , sparked confusion from around the globe .
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly interlinked , can be expected from the Fed representatives , that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to a better understanding of the to obtain global economy .
Your decision is `` more art than science , '' said Zachary Karabell , head of global strategy for the asset management of the company Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA. , Noticed this month that `` the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are not associated with apparently with the economic fundamentals . ''
Lacker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de 's commitment to raise interest rates , citing decisions in 1998/1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings `` despite limited discernible effect on growth in the US , '' Lacker said .
A year later , the Fed 's representatives made these cuts reversed .
The Fed should put questions of financial stability only during a serious crisis as the collapse of the market in 2008 in the first place , said Adam S. Posen , a former member of the Committee for the interest rate down the Bank of England .
The recent turmoil do not come close to this level , he said .
`` You will not surely fall into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest rates , because the markets are upset , '' said Posen , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and did not mention the financial stability , and to the changes , I do not think that they should run ahead of time .

Angela Merkel and refugee policy : `` We can do it ''
The influx of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is committed to meeting them .
What is in Germany ?
Around 800 000 asylum applicants are in this year , according to forecasts of the Ministry of the Interior to Germany , according to statement from Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) is Germany even able to take a million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated , given the unusual challenge determination : `` I say again and again : We can do this , and we can do that . ''
What to expect Germany , provides the following overview .
be used by different forecasts between 350,000 ( estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400000 ( estimate of Pestel Institute ) flats a year - and the next five years .
That 's almost twice as much as is being built to date ( 250,000 apartments ) .
Dramatically the lack of housing is above all at affordable rental properties : annual fall 60000-80000 social housing out of rent control , and to this particularly favorable apartments also refugees apply .
Bundesbauministerin Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) will therefore double the funding , from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
Far too little is from the perspective of Pestel Institute : arise need 80,000 social housing units annually and it takes the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion a year to invest .
Agreement among scientists and Bundesbauministerin are that it must also give more tax breaks for investment in housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research is assumed that in the long term , with 55 percent of the fugitives may be employed in Germany .
However , the refugees were not systematically asked in Germany to their qualifications to help them get started , criticized Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation .
but is crucial for the integration of refugees , whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the host society , but also for the self-esteem of migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt .
In Germany there has been a change of regime , according Thränhardt : the ban on working for refugees to recognition of work .
While there was a ban on working for asylum seekers for up to five years earlier , this the applicant was reduced in November 2014 , three months as well as the residence obligation , limited to a residence .
the view of the majority prevailed that refugees access to the labor market should be made possible faster - In the Company has - also because of the shortage of skilled workers .
A major hurdle for access to the labor market are missing knowledge of German .
So far there is no sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses .
Studies also show that most jobs are mediated by personal contacts .
The development of networks is therefore the opinion of Thränhardt the royal road to work integration .
The Berlin school directorate has found that few refugee parents give their children to day care centers , an estimated ten to 15 percent : `` For the uprooted parents , it is once very important , keep the family together , '' says Ilja Koschembar , spokesperson for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate .
However , to convince the family of the benefits of Kita , distributed management handouts in different languages .
Should the demand for teachers by the large number of refugees to rise sharply , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about by allowing more schools .
In the countries students are prepared without knowledge of German welcome classes to teach .
However , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
In them there is no shortage , says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school directorate .
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle prohibits any State applicants or tolerated the study - the only exception was previously Berlin 's Interior Senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has his attitude but now abandoned .
Studierwilligen refugees could access to college easier .
For refugees with a residence permit or submission to get any benefits under the Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz more when they start studying .
The latter basically get no student loans because they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled BAföG .
Tolerated refugees had previously lived for four years in Germany to be BafÃ¶g entitled from 1 January 2016 , this margin reduced to 15 months .
but these funding gap must be closed , ask Steffen Barney , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
Students should immediately get student loans .
Islam will play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state-church law evolve to a new state-religion relationship .
Important would be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association , the professional care of the new arrivals .
The rights include duties .
Thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and should have some control options .
This includes the willingness to bravely combat religious fundamentalism .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Aiman Mazyek , expressed on Thursday concern religious conflicts could be carried into them by Germany .
Those who wanted to deliver such conflicts in Germany , `` immediately have their right to stay here , forfeited in Germany , '' he said in the Bavarian Radio .
He suggested that the Basic Law to translate in Arabic .
Integration is much more than today in future be an issue of the whole society .
This also explains the majority society will have to change , is the eradication of discrimination and racism more pressing .
Although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for nearly a decade , an anti-discrimination office and a General Act on Equality .
But he learns very slowly , as the NSU murders showed in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
Equal opportunities for all : What migrant organizations and stakeholders not white German have long been demanding and what international agreements such as the ICERD Germany undertake , must become a reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - to benefit of all .
Generally Germany is able to provide the previously expected refugees medicine , says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
`` Concerning Man- power and capacity , we can do that , '' he told the Tagesspiegel .
However , should it flow into the system additional money .
To avoid bottlenecks , calls Montgomery , all comers equal hand over health card when registering .
Services provided may be charged later with the provinces .
And in the long term it is highly questionable to fob so many people with the limited catalog of services , the providing for the Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz .
Otherwise , go to work the doctors , especially the language barriers .
Even before this , the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated migrants are poor aware of their disease than other patients .
Not only in hospitals , in doctors ' offices would interpreter costs are covered , she asks .
Helped would many refugees but even with more general medical correspondents in emergency departments .
And with another diagnostic view .
Among refugee children as there were significantly more untreated disabilities , and among young people it related to HIV education .
With the partial other conditions would German doctors of their education here but clearly says Montgomery .
`` Parasites or tuberculosis are not as difficult to detect '' . As for the shortage of doctors , whether by refugees maybe even relief in sight .
The Syrians have a highly developed educational system , many refugees are even doctors .
However , to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their competence and perhaps again take exams .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill , according to estimates of the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists ( BPtK ) : Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Particularly vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Munz , President of BPtK .
A recent study of the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child traumatized arrives in Germany .
Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , suffering , among others , so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath , dizziness , palpitations and fear of death .
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong startle response and emotional numbness .
To prevent that symptoms would chronically , early treatment is necessary , said Munz .
So far , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees received psychotherapy .
Although can mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services make a request for psychotherapy , but processing takes usually several months .
In addition , would in the social services usually clerk or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness , decide whether a treatment is necessary or not .
This often leads to misperceptions , says Munz .

Mr Dhakal said police have used tear gas and fired into the air , before they resorted to rubber bullets .
20 policemen and five civilians were wounded , he said .
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used , one of which is known to kill while , but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
The dispute was the latest violent in weeks protests in Nepal 's southern plains , where members of ethnic Madhesi say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want their own state .

The legislature voted this week about certain provisions in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .

Smokers have to lose a higher risk of teeth
Smokers therefore not only damages the lungs , but also the teeth - which sets a long-term study Potsdamer close .
The good news : In waiving the risk decreases rapidly .
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
This is evident from the long-term study by an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
Compared to nonsmokers was in smokers the risk prematurely losing their teeth , 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher .
Scientists had more than 23,300 participants observed .
Main causes of tooth loss are decay and inflammation of the gums that emphasizes DIfE .
For these periodontitis smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
The link between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back on frequent gingivitis in smokers .
was not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
People who stopped smoking , their risk , but may decrease in a short time , the researchers write in the `` Journal of Dental Research '' .
It could , however , take more than ten years , until the hazard falling back to the level of nonsmokers , said lead author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
We must convince people to be Non smoking , said study leader Heiner Boeing from DIfE : `` Smoking reduces life time . ''
Not smoking is good for the lungs and blood vessels and leads to our knowledge also to good dental health into old age .
In Germany , about 20 percent of the population are affected aged 65 to 74 years of edentulism , shared the DIfE with .
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .

Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England 's team , but it is still hard
On Pakistan to push in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if the squad , England has selected for the tour you can see a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not rule out an away win .
Alastair Cook 's side may be less experienced than three years ago , but there are good spin player in the batting line-up , and the community spirit is strong ; they are no scars of 2012 Calendar , only a teen-positive attitude .
With the ball to Moeen Ali developed as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , is an option for the attack .
Thereafter related message : Adam Lyth is leaving the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales .
Of course , the decision to leave out Adam Lyth is , for me as his head coach in Yorkshire , difficult to analyze .
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and is the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are geared to results .
There was no question mark at Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nomination , because - and I have said before this - players are their own best selector .
Long ago , one would have extended the run of Lyth , but he was in control of his own destiny .
If he knocks out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire , comes another chance .
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even if it did not yield as good performance , and that does not surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
The question of how much time gets a Test batsman to put his mark is difficult .
Lyth got seven chances - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton nine got .
Only Compton got the chance to home and away games .
The only reproach which one can raise , was that England first Jonathan Trott began in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex Hales comes in , and he is a batsman , the I value highly .
He 's an X-factor Cricketer what we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored on a Trent Bridge Place 236 against us , which was very hit us .
He must have at least the same opportunities as the get in front of him , but this of course depends on the team 's formation , in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea to propose Moeen beside Cook what an extra-spin bowler and provide four Quicks would receive , appeared , and I do not mind .
I do not see why a batsman there can not be beat , and the left-handed has already shown that he 's a hotshot Cricket Player .
Moeen might have his job for his County Worcestershire not done , but it is a number 3 on it , and since there is no big difference .
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests in the first drop before it occurred 2001 as opener .
He managed three hundred runs immediately and did not look back .
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner , and in my limited dealings with him , he impressed me as a young man .
People look at possibly its statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - think and it is a punt , but there is no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and have the coach opted for youth ,
He will learn on this tour a lot .
Apart from the team England has made some clever additions at the coaching staff .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the batsman from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test matches could be a champion coup .
He is one of the nicest guys of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as he played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
I always felt already that it is designed for international cricket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit .
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in accordance with the foregoing .
Collys teammate in Durham , Ben Stokes , is not used in the one-dayers , Root received a similar break to Australia and I have no problem on my part with it .
Some will not agree , but coaches and team stand not to specify the schedule .
And you must remember that their jobs depend on the outcome as the players .
Such decisions are not taken lightly .

JVA Tegel : Five square cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has an ex-prisoner of the prison Tegel fairly given , which was months housed in a too small cell .

Otherwise , would be `` a stunting of the legal protection of personality to be feared '' .
The Supreme Court must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation .
The constitutional judges in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .

Di Maria hits to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmo .
Di Maria hits on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , helping PSG to overtake Malmö .
Here are the game and the response to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course , as Paris Saint-Germain 's Champions League started the season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo in Parc des Princes on Tuesday .
Di Maria struck less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG player who brought the French champions on the way , but after they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61st minute scored with a header .
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A needed Paris a strong start against the Swedish champions as they strive not just to qualify for the K.O . rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a class match of Laurent Blanc 's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed opportunities in front of goal . He was later in the game against his hometown team and to the club with which he began his illustrious career in 1999 , substituted .
`` It 's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League Therefore , it is a good start . 2 : 0 win to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we in the course the season still need perfecting , `` Blanc said .
`` This is a good sign .
We wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have scored one or two more goals not yet. ``
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of three changes in the Paris team back , which is a 2 weekend : could hold 2 draws on its own course against Bordeaux in the first division , but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
The Argentine winger was named the man of the PSG can take to the next level in Europe when he was acquired last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he was running in Marco Verrattis pass behind the Malmö-defense before passing beautifully finished to Johan Wiland into the far corner of the net .
However , if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , which was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a play-off hit to reach this stage , joined Anpiff with nine internationals in the field and was associated with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield lined up a tough opponent .
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic who passed away on Kevin Trapp 's post in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PSG gave itself to sometimes , with some bad passes and bad accounts , not the least of Ibrahimovic , who slips up alone in the first half with no less than five attempts and was then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart .
Nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his teammates into play , and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic , the Di Maria turned in a shot on the turn , which was deflected past Wiland from 52 minutes to the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks Cavani . The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season so after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank by Maxwell .
This ended all thought that Malmö could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention by Wiland blank range to stop David Luiz , could hold the final low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi goal was disallowed at the end .
The coach of Malmö , Åge Hareide , admitted later that PSG played a class on his team , and the Norwegians said : `` Our last Champions League match was in December last year .
Since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which does not have the same level .
The qualifiers are not enough. ``
Hats off to Paris !
It was a great game of them !

One of them was also charged with abuse of office .
From this accusation he has been acquitted in May .
The current trial was postponed .
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel had emerged during the preliminary investigation that the defendants used from 2006 to 2011 funds from club accounts over which they were allowed to dispose in their functions , for private purposes over the years .
He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros .
The sports officials are also accused of financial offenses .
This fact separated the chairman of the Senate lay judges , Judge Michaela Sanin , from .
It should be negotiated at a later time .
To discard the infidelity outlined the defense that the association at no time a financial loss arose .
The sports officials have charged only expense allowances and the Sports Club , for which they have been from 1982 worked until 2011 and in which they have invested much time and money , led out of the debt - ( . Around 44,000 euros ) is liabilities amounted in 2001 around 600,000 Schilling ,
`` Back then we were faced with the situation : we run the club further or we lock on , '' said one of the defendants , in bread professional wholesale auditor of the tax office .
With his colleague and co-defendant he had then decided to take on this task .
With all the risks .
`` We have advanced to money , our life insurance laid as collateral with the bank , '' he said at the hearing .
The club had been agreed : You can manage the money freely , it may only be made no debts .
the payment of allowances success been retroactively decided until 1991 - Further is - with appropriate financial .
Had therefore been a part of the expense allowances until years later , as was an increase in the account namely from 2003 , is paid .
Hence holiday packages and not detailed charges appeared on , explained the former chairman the operations .
The accounts and savings accounts managed the two defendants together , said the second defendant .
Why the payouts were the club not disclosed in detail , asked the judge .
The association did not interested in the detail required for financial management , important is only the debt freedom have been the answer .
As in 2011 , investigations began against a functionary for abuse of authority , a sum of 120,000 euros was paid into the association 's account .
The reserves were declared the accused .
This securities account was in the name of the second accused and according to his statement the club was not known .
`` Why ? '' Asked the judge .
Then the respondent knew long answer .
Then he finally said he had believed that this was the best for the club .
If something had happened to him , no one would have known some of that money , put the prosecutor in the room .
The co-defendant had been informed , the official justified .
This transfer has been formulated as `` reparation '' .
Why Schadensgutmachung wanted ? , know judge and prosecutor .
Then told the first defendant , he was not in agreement with this formulation because the club no loss has never arisen .
But what should I do , if the lawyer says : `` By you all off the hook '' .
`` Am I a legal representative ? '' He asked .
Furthermore , the official said that he had never obtained a penny salary , he had netted only mileage allowance and diets .
On diets he had the association asked 1,000 euros per month in account is the actual expenses but have been much higher , he added .
Exact documentation of the early years could not produce the defendants .
These were no longer kept to a tax audit , in which everything was judged to be correct , they said .
Mileage allowance had taken the second defendant .
All fixes are made in cash , in addition he had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg , he said in his statement .
The trial continues on 23 September with the hearing of witnesses .

Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
Later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
If it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection .
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
The invitation was already the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day approached , I began to be afraid .
So , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way , the whole story about the death penalty to tell .
It would offer a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US , and often there are more applications than places available , there will be a macabre lottery to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has the number of media seats reduced from 12 to five .
Whoever is chosen , it is observed emotion .
I can not do this .
I 'll sit next to Richard Glossips tightest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a half hours visiting .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we talk .
The prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so I shall be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality .
Here is the lesson .
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it , and for access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she `` could have been better formulated '' but she still thinks that it is wrong what I 'm doing .
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things that I have said and written .
He does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter is present to write there .
If he dies , he thinks that the publicity of the movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bellware , a reporter for the Huffington Post , is sitting next to me .
Please , if you want to know more about the case , you will hear the series of podcasts that I have made .
I will not go into all the details again .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary indeed .
But I believe that a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to warrant a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from this perspective , I will watch him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn it .
What you will get from me , is what it is , an unnecessary death dying to see a man .

Metcash starts Bodenständigkeits campaign to combat Aldi incident
Metcash trying to protect the IGA stores before an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia .
Food wholesaler Metcash has Bodenständigkeits campaign launched to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Aldi invasion .
While Aldi prepared to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengthen Metcash and IGA supermarkets its relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand by mainstream marketing and marketing on the social media , as well as through events Adelaide show .
IGA retailers and suppliers jumping on board , with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough , which distributes in IGA stores samples and shopkeepers who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
It is expected that Metcash more details of its defense strategy on 29 September published if the wholesaler of food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual Investor Strategy Day .
Much is at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states .
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern countries .
However , analysts believe how Morgan Stanley that Aldi will snatch twelve months following the opening of its first stores around five percent of the food market in these two countries and all known actors , but mainly independent retailers sales will take away .
A report published this week report , estimated the Analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million in sales per year and Metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016th
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss in the food and grocery store and in the quantities on Metcashs high fixed cost base could Metcash cost around $ 13 million profit before interest and taxes , Mr Kierath said .
At the same time loses Metcash market share in the Eastern countries , mainly at Aldi and Coles , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs sales in the food and grocery will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent will reduce to 2020th
Last week told the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass , the founder of Magellan Financial Group , a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash probably within a decade . will Metcash disappear .
Metcash declined to respond publicly on the comments of Mr Douglass .
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash with Mr Douglass last week contacted .
IGAs market share has dropped since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Metcashs food and food trade , which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailer , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins ,
However , the wholesalers defends itself by investing more than $ 150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products every week and improve IGA retailers in improving their shops by faster-growing fresh food and a better selection of private label to provide -Lebensmitteln .
Metcashs chief executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store refurbishment programs are set to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return in 2017 for the first time in four years at a profit growth .

In an emergency admits Professor of having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call Professor Shannon Lamb told with a slightly shaky voice to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize the fact that his `` sweet dog '' but still alive and had probably excited and he said the family contacts the dead woman could be found on the phone .
Inside the home , officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note which was scrawled on a white block : `` I do it so sorry , I wish I could undo , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me. `` This was reported by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
There was no indication that Lamb , who , taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he claimed to police a popular history professor , Ethan Schmidt , on the door has shot to his office and killed .
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10:18 AM .
He said that Lamb has eventually made the fateful emergency thereafter .
By the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took his own life when police him einkesselte .
A day after the shooting in the university , the students and teachers forced them to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to gain a picture of what motivated Lamb .
Published by the investigators at both ends of the state details , as well as what students and staff who knew him testified , helped to paint a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teacher .
Students said that they looked forward to his lessons .
Police in Gautier where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt himself had Lamb mentioned in a written by him book in which he mentioned the `` wonderful people '' with whom he shared his academic life .
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses by both .
At the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors .
A student , Brandon Beavers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a bit excited and nervous , `` as if something was wrong with him . ''
Another student , Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had told him that he had at the end of the academic year 2014-15 to deal with stress .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to a leave of absence for health reasons and said here that he had any health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
Recent changes in the employment policies of the university meant that the promotion had worked so hard for the Lamb , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor of him .
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course there was something in Mr. Lamb 's idea . ''
These are questions that the Lamb can not answer .
After fleeing from the campus police found later Lambs track when he import again in Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be arrested , killed himself Lamb selbstmit a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said .
His car was still in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started in 2009 his work at the University , which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy .
He received his doctorate in spring in pedagogy .
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play the guitar .
He was the heartthrob .
All the girls melted away when he was there , `` Hairston said , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon .
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together .
In the emergency Lamb said , `` I have my wife killed '' , but there was no certificate of marriage .
They had a dog named Lightning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier .
Police said that the dog was fine .
The ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn O'Steen , said they were divorced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
`` She was totally destroyed on the ground , '' O'Steen said about his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb , but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and Blues played .
Lamb struck Prentiss , when he and Abigail both occurred on a summer carnival three years ago .
Later they played together the odd gig .
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a dimly lit bar near Gautier , said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night on September 5 last after Lamb his guitar and harmonica ended had ended in front of a sparse audience .
There were no signs that something was wrong .
`` Just a happy couple , '' he said .
We were busy clearing and joking with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of jokes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the freshman seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell said , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee .
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night took about 900 people , including faculty , staff , students and community members at a candlelight memorial service part .
Schmidt 's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil , while the University Choir `` Bright Morning Star '' and `` Amazing Grace '' sang .
Classes will resume on Wednesday .
`` We are trying our students to encourage them to return , '' LaForge said .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he Schmidt shot , and that lamb indeed called his wife in his emergency Prentiss , but there is no indication that the two ever got married .

BBC should give EastEnders , says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice . He said that commercial rivals `` would give their right arm '' for hit shows like the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the license fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not transmitted by other UK broadcasters .
He criticized the BBC for being to place public service programs that are likely to see a smaller audience in hard controversial time slot against the popular shows of their rivals and from channels like BBC4 .
After the BBC director general , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 , unsuccessfully , to come into contact with the BBC .
`` I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are or sends that would also shown clearly by non-subsidized rivals in order , '' Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep the license fee , which I medium or long term not consider it a good idea , you should give its production at least on programs that others do not , or in order .
Send The Voice in a prime time slot because they want to reach the widest possible support for its future .
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it 's ridiculous , it is of course nonsense .
Johnson said : `` I do not see why a regressive tax programs financed , which could be financed without subsidies .
The Voice is one such program , EastEnders is another , admittedly both productions .
would Honestly other channels give their right arm for .
I struggle to see how this public television should be .
I do not think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a contractor for series of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 headed , said that the BBC was responsible for chasing ratings `` because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support. ``
His comments on the most popular programs of the BBC give back what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders .
Johnson said that the more public niche programs should go to BBC4 `` where you pretty much the audience can not measure , but they carry out their tasks , and they can argue when their sanctimonious missions to justify 4 billion £ broadcast fees go , `` Well , of course , we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen . ''
Place it in a window of time in which no one would ever see .
For broadcasting fee Johnson told the committee : `` I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
Of course , you all think , we all think that one here gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people , which is a lot of money for the £ 150 , wonder if that 's true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
Former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein , who testified on Tuesday before the Committee , demanded that the BBC should reconsider its Reithian mission , `` to inform , to educate and entertain '' .
He said little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should be and the public television channels in Australia Canada is an example take this change in `` inform , educate and entertain '' .
On the question of partnerships said Elstein , the BBC should do more . In areas such as the Proms , of which he said that only a handful of TV show , and go with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes against rivals due to allegations wrestling back
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of the Tackling his players as `` agenda-setting '' of two Premier League favorite NRL .
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have the Storm players `` wrestling '' allows his team during the high-Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night . He called the game a `` prime example '' of Rugby League , saying that not `` too good '' were the two from Queensland in wrestling .
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg his team and said that they are focused only on their `` Contact '' at the tackle .
Bellamy added that the review of two leading trainer at his team confident vote him because it meant that they were concerned to be hit by Storm team .
`` This comes up again and again - I did not hear that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when she 24 us : have 2 hit , '' Bellamy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing defensive in our system or the techniques throughout the year . But in the last six weeks we have made a real focus our contact in tackles , and has provided the turnaround for us .
Trent is now three years there , and he obviously has to train a great team . It is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
It 's funny how this keeps coming up this time of year .
Bellamy has Bennetts idea of `` exciting football '' attacked and remembers his mentor because Bennetts St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with `` boring '' football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , `` Bellamy said .
I remember that St George was criticized as a boring team in 2010 , and Wayne said that he would not give a shit about .
But now he has a team that can play and which we consider interesting , especially his young players with their speed .
That 's the ball game that you want to play when you have these types of players .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his own way of playing football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like this .
I build more confidence , because they say these things , because they are a bit worried having to play against us .
Six weeks ago , they probably have not thought of us when it came to the big games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the game against Storm Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys .
The play of the Broncos was probably a good game , I have not considered it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
Or are making breaks and no points something exciting ?
For me it is the match schedule .
If they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase of it .
The Storm team has released this weekend , as they have won the right to either North or the receiving Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening at Vorfinale in AAMI Park . Ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning .

Delicate folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago , Sufjan Stevens sitting on stage in Cologne Prime Club ( now Luxor ) .
Next to him stands a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with a felt pen .
The entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken from Stevens lecture .
He told through various places he inscribes repeatedly on the map , what its minutely and delicately arranged songs report .
Where they originated and what it looks like , in his home .
Since then , Stevens proves wonderfully creative madman .
By published in 2003 and the third album `` Greetings from Michigan : The Great Lake State '' cleverly composed songs that blend very close clinging to American folk of the late sixties , but any time can drift into great opulent appear .

Hammer Artist invested for three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold ) Crown of Thorns is one of the masterpieces that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alte Post wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not at Otmar-Alt-Bible , which is now published with magnificent images .
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt , who has formulated in 150 designs his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
His `` language '' with bright colors and fanciful shapes received the 75-year-old - but this is by no means synonymous with `` funny '' pictures .
On the contrary : Adapted to the respective topics that may well look quite gloomy .
Around three years , Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many themes of the `` book of all books '' .
The result are cycles , dedicate themselves issues such crossroads , plagues , bids or the Our Father .
He has spontaneously several partners intrigued : This applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as for the Kettler publisher with its emphasis on art books .
And there is especially the author Klaus Alte Post , which has dealt on the basis of the painting with the respective passages .
He interprets the selected Otmar Alt scriptures and `` translated '' into today , in current relationships .
These texts are as verbal levels of Alts painting .
Nestled them between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and each one set of the artist who expresses his personal thoughts on the situation here .
The jewelry cover has golden letters .
So the 75-year-old allowed twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high degree of intimacy .
Feelings were ultimately any trigger for the Bible project : Otmar Alt , born in 1940 in Wernigerode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Medal .
`` Since the education happened already with the cane , '' says Otmar Alt recalls .
`` I 've tried to work up to perhaps again to tolerate me with the Lord father '' .
be His second concern , the art in fast-moving time to help back to more important : `` The perception of imagery is today dominated by advertising , and is loud .
Symbolism is displaced there .
Artists have another delight and bliss , things to show .
Images always have something mysterious and not decorative .
`` In this regard , I 'm a dinosaur . ''
Otmar Alt wants to let the viewer in the pictures `` fall into it '' , they soak up , discover and sense the energy they have : `` The picture looks for his opponent . ''
Klaus Alte Post admitted on Tuesday during the presentation of Otmar-Alt-bible in Otmar-Alt-Stiftung , `` always '' a lover of Otmar Alt to have been art : `` I like how he understands life with his pictures . ''
Alt did not pay attention , the Bible fully grasp but selected are important to him , even mysterious subjects .
`` That was not cooperation on an equal footing , '' said Alte Post : `` This is about the images , the text explains only '' . The result is a photo-Bible .
For Hans Mohler from Luther-Verlag this is an invitation `` to deepen his life and to find freedom . ''
Otmar Alt 's images speak for Mohler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
Part of the originals - paper and canvas pictures - will be unveiled in an exhibition which will be opened in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung on 15 November .

Friends Festival : the comedy show which gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up , is now made more desperate than ever , as evidenced by suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high .
In 2013 it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common in men than in women .
In an effort to tackle the issue , announced the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM - campaign against a miserable life ) of 2015 as the year of the man who , with the aim of placing culture at issue that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
Friendship is the heart of the fight to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that when the sufferer a sufficiently high percentage of friends with `` healthy atmosphere '' had his chances of recovery doubled .
For those who are not depressed , halved , a group of sane friends the risks of mental health problems .
Of course , one must first have friends so a friendship can work .
In the era of guided through social media communication , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immediacy of response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have the need to appear strong , cheerful and successful , doubled , although in reality dominates the insulation .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values ; Money , image , social status , all intrinsic cost values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which affects much deeper on our mental health .
And like a video game creator billionaire recently declared , money can buy happiness not really .
The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down .
Each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality that shone through the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey and Chandler 's frequent hugs , moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross by Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case , even if they often hold back fully their feelings to explore .
As an employee of the telephone counseling it told me : ... `` my listeners role for people who feel depressed and suicidal are , I really shown clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
The old saying , `` I come so rightly '' has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking openly about problems. ``
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms .
It presents very clearly the little moments of male friendships .
Like My objective outsider status over the phone to help people so much in moments of desperation and that long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so , when you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friends festival with the honor of the day completely redesigned backdrop , why do not you take your friends for a drink in the Central Perk with .
Or , better yet , if you see someone sit in Starbucks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
You never know what difference could make your friendship .
Friends sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the whole 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest

EU wants to double mercury limit in predators
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish and expect consumers so that a significantly higher dose of nerve agent .
The consumer organization Food Watch , which there is a corresponding one of the EU working paper , the plans sharply criticized : `` risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy are passed on in full force to pregnant women and infants , '' explained Matthias Wolf Schmidt of Food Watch .
According to Wolf Schmidt to the limits of the nerve agent for big fish at the end of the food chain , such as shark or swordfish from `` economic reasons '' be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
Large predators are but already so contaminated with mercury that about 50 percent of the catch can not be sold on the basis of currently applicable limits .
After doubling the thresholds then only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable .
In return for this easing the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram , according to Food Watch .
Foodwatch but called it a `` trick '' because smaller predatory fish , such as carp usually charged so low that they comply with the proposed maximum values already .
The reduction in young fish is therefore `` a perfidious diversion that helps the economy alone , '' said Wolf Schmidt .
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal to humans , which concentrates heavily on the food chain , especially in predatory fish .
The Federal Government warns that can `` even small amounts especially in unborn damage to the nervous system '' cause .
The Federal Environment Ministry said on its website with regard to the maximum levels applicable but that a `` health risk in the general population '' could not be expected .
Mercury passes mainly through the combustion of coal in the environment .
The German coal-fired plants , according to a written inquiry from the Federal Environment Ministry to the Greens parliamentarian Annalena Baerbock more than six tonnes of mercury a year from two-thirds of the radiation emitted in Germany total .
The concentration of mercury in fish as in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was `` permanently and exceeded coverage '' , the `` mirror '' was quoted in March from the paper .
Last year included Europe warnings of mercury in fish already among the commonly reported health risks EU RASFF .

She softens the slightly bitter taste of some salad greens such as chicory and radicchio .
And a mango chutney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand before the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere , that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario is already that Wilshere sure at least the next four games for England will miss and , given its history is its participation in the next summer at the European sure still uncertain .
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had strong finishes last season after a separate ankle injury and had then found back again to his old swing during preseason .
`` This type of injury does not threaten the career , '' said Wenger .
It 's a bone that does not heal well .
This is no more matter .
This was just an accident .
It was not in connection with his knuckles or with the injuries he had before .
That may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wenger also recognized , there is the inherent risk of further injury , always when a player tries to return in mid-season .
It also developed an unpleasant pattern .
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd. listed 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago .
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal 's 157 league games in the last five seasons .
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most days of injury .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement will continue in the injury rate during the last season .
`` Sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power , '' said Wenger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabilizes , I am confident that he will do it and it will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday , and Wenger makes a rotation within the teams .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start .
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
`` I try to keep the balance and the players who need to indulge a little breather , '' said Wenger .
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to progress through Group F , the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe .
Dynamo are unbeaten after 41 games , after which was launched `` invincible '' campaign last season .
The stadium was rocked Tuesday night by an earthquake , which measured 3.2 on the Richter scale .
This year was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes that Arsenal has the doctrine drawn from the last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope , with his management team to lead to his first European Cup triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '' said Wenger .
It has never worked at Arsenal .
We were in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand , I am in business long enough to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .

That Viktor Orbán now sends more Thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
Instead of helping the camp Röszke immediately in the construction of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has high officially and publicly pushed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of National Socialism .
Victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing in the border areas with chaotic conditions .
The fugitives will have to find that the `` promised land '' , which she has invited and welcomed , not as another refugee camp is .
It will be a major challenge , given the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , make decent conditions for those seeking sanctuary with us .
And it will be even more - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .

In an emergency call professor to have shot his girlfriend admits
In an emergency call Professor Shannon Lamb with a slightly quavering told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was it important to stress that his `` sweet dog '' but still live and probably was excited , and he said that the dead woman 's family contacts could be found on the phone .
Inside the house , the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss , a handwritten note , scribbled on a white block : `` I am so sorry , I wanted to , I could make it back , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . '' This was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
There was no indication that Lamb , who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , 300 miles already went to the school grounds , according to the police , a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his office was shot and killed .
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn said Wednesday that university staff the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m. heard .
He said that Lamb made the disastrous emergency sometime after that .
By the end of the day , there was another death : Lamb took her own life when the police einkesselte him .
A day after the shootings at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb .
The investigators at both ends of the state released details , as well as revelatory as students and staff who knew him , helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
Students said that they were happy with his teaching .
The police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt Lamb himself had mentioned in a book written by him , in which he spoke of the `` beautiful people '' with whom he shared his academic life .
Both taught in the department of social sciences and history , whose teaching staff consists of 17 members , and many students attended classes from both .
At the same time , there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors .
A student , Brandon Beavers , praised Lamb , said he seemed a little too excited and nervous , `` as if something was wrong with him . ''
Another student , Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had told him that he was at the end of the academic year 2014-15 had to do with stress .
Lamb had the Delta State University , asked for a leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
Recent changes in the employment of the university meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard , for it does not guarantee an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor .
University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , of course , but `` there was something in Mr. Lambs idea . ''
These are questions that can no longer answer Lamb .
After fleeing the campus police later found Lambs when he could back into Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be arrested Lamb killed , selbstmit a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said .
His car was still in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of approximately 12,000 and taught geography and pedagogy .
He received his doctorate in education in the spring .
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla hair tone said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her the guitar .
He was then the women swarm .
All the girls melted away when he was there , `` said hair tone , now 40 , and in the suburb of Brandon Jackson resident .
Lamb and Prentiss were apparently some time together .
In an emergency , Lamb said , `` I 've killed my wife , '' but there was no certificate of marriage .
You had a dog named Lightning , with them in the brick house , located on a Bayou in Gautier .
The police said that the dog was in order .
The ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn O 'Steen , said that they had been divorced 15 years ago , but have remained friends and had a daughter , now 19 years old .
`` She was totally devastated , '' O 'Steen said of his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O 'Steen said he had never met Lamb , but by his daughter Abigail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played guitar .
Lamb met Prentiss , as he and Abigail three years ago at a summer fair .
Later , they played a gig .
O 'Steen said , his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a barman and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a dimly lit bar near Gautier , said that he and Lamb Prentiss Night at night 5 September saw for the last time , after Lamb , his guitar and harmonica playing stopped in front of a sparse audience had ended .
There was no indication that anything was wrong .
`` Just a happy couple , '' he said .
We were laughing and joking with each other the clean up .
I think they both had a good sense of jokes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first-year seminar program , specialising in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee .
At Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including faculty , staff , students and members of the community participate in a candle-light ceremony .
Schmidt 's wife , Liz , and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil , the university choir `` Bright Morning Star '' and `` Amazing Grace '' while singing .
The classes will resume on Wednesday .
`` We are trying to encourage our students to return , '' said upon .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and Lamb described in his emergency Prentiss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two were ever married .

The Brexit camp = Brexit ( British exit from the EU ) are gaining popularity as the economy by the year 2017 is in the doldrums
David Cameron 's half-baked Neuverhandlungs Strategy in order to keep Britain in the EU , with each day deeper into trouble , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy `` Is it yes or no ? '' Corbyn for leader of Labour and the TUC , because Europe was renowned on Tuesday .
Foreigners also have their Corbyn 's and Nigel Farage 's .
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states , so deeply enmeshed in various crises , such as the EU , it is now , and not always through their own fault , Britain 's own agenda with divided concessions and disruptive changes that they are not usually like that .
In Brighton , the TUC decided at their annual meeting that it may not be them if they threaten social protection .
We could also have Dave and Georges Selfie-agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb summits and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , a photograph of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reform .
It is always about me .
My European friend , an outwards-looking Britain inside the EU tent wants - `` Let us not just with France , '' says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals came to the point where it is no matter to them , whether we stay or go .
Germany 's careful prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , such as lunchtime of those like Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand and Kohl ( 14 ) ( 16 is in the overly long ) .
France 's François Hollande looks back on his re-election or its replacement in 2017 .
He is also a declining force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government , Spain left .
It is hard to imagine that they will bend over backwards to help the Selfie-Britons , whose energy should be used more , Scotland 's exit from the UK - to prevent something they may not want to , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
So maybe some of these ministers are planning even deliberately unhelpful comments , SNP-style , while Britain 's referendum campaign in 2017 , in order to accelerate the process of Brexit , thought my friend .
`` The renegotiation was a bust , '' and `` Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation . ''
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and the EU sceptics is the oligarchy of the press barons , as they did during the referendum in 1975 , inspired by Tony Benn were not , however , that our entry in 1973 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
You can be weak to Boris Johnson , the ore-euro opportunists , who has a reputation as an EU `` straight bananas '' Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s .
For all its craziness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
This included a medley of tax-fearing-rogue , phone-hack of foreigners and the pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers .
Tony Blair really thought much about it , but noted that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage , you better distributed bananas to distract him , rather than on his lunch and dinner .
In fact , Miliband was more Blairianer as Blair himself when he resisted Cameron 's referendum , because Blair had not adopted the principle of the EU Constitution , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , he opened the back door .
The press has never forgiven him. ``
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn , of me in Westminster on Monday for a friendly slap on the back - I told him that he had no time for me to waste need - seems in danger of Neil Kinnock 's boycott Murdoch strategy of 80 years to repeat a mistake then and now .
It may be , but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win over the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyn 's official position on Europe is - I express it politely - in development .
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
Now , most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye-tendency and the wilder climes of Tories Klein-Engländerismus can say yes to everyone .
It is to admit it , `` said Hilary Benn , not a Bennite '' Benn on the radio and on television this week , when the Scouts fought in it , not that Corbyn 's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 1970s , when his old father on television what , disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his Cabinet job .
Hilarys fight was even more attractive .
But struggling to remain `` under any circumstances '' - Benns - was not what McDonnell said , nor what JC and his colleagues told delegates after all the reports on their conclave on Monday evening .
Whatever the mawkish bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that even he has moved me - news-discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock , and , above all , in the maelstrom of social media , a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe , which allows him to Labour 's support in the referendum campaign to keep a foregone conclusion , as McDonnell , it said .
Sure Simon Jenkins thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyn 's fundamental ambiguities to EU membership - in line with its Bennite Belagerungs-economy , its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents , for whom the narcissism of small difference a central principle of dogmatic disputes .
As with all its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC is launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors .
Why Paris or Berlin should waste political capital - they have to make distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British , if anything can be meaningless ?
The US is already quite disappointed by the lack of military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in the Tory government in power , how do I start on Monday was reminiscent of something , which is called British Influence Security Forum .

Robot cars : Government wants to lead for Germany
Germany should be according to the will of the federal government to change the car a technological pioneer .
The federal cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which , among other things , investment in digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the IAA auto show of a `` new era of mobility . ''
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide less congestion , Dobrindt said .
He also wants the issue with his counterparts from the G7 to discuss at the IAA will also meet with representatives of the industry .
The strategy of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , stressed the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio .
Testing new technology at a test track on the highway 9 is currently in Bavaria .
So no additional liability risks being saddled with the `` driver , '' the federal government wants to review the legal framework `` and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . ''
So , for example , Germany wants to work internationally to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
The federal government also wants to push for an amendment to the Vienna Convention , which so far only the people as a driver .
The automated driving the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver will be more and more to the passenger .
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture and process the data in seconds .
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020 .
Nevertheless , driverless cars on public roads `` were not expected until well after 2020 . ''
The added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors of the study estimate for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
`` The digital networking of the cars to improve safety and efficiency in road transport , '' said the SPD politician traffic Sören Bartol .
The question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver but clearly needs to be clarified .
The Germans , however , self-driving cars are sceptical - much more than the French or Americans .
On Wednesday one of the AA 's poll by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the inspection organization Dekra has come to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars over the next ten years will prevail , only 32 percent expected in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in them .
In France , 21 percent of respondents anticipate that by 2025 , with autonomous driving cars , 33 % in the US .
Anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self-driving vehicle .
According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom only seven percent would agree to cede control over the whole driving on all roads .
On the highway , it could present in flowing traffic as much as 15 percent to 45 percent in a traffic jam .
Well , one in four would car control under any circumstances .

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy 's beats against rivals because of allegations to ring fight back
The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism of the tack Ling his players as `` agenda setting '' of two Premier League favourites in the NRL .
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the referees the Storm players `` wrestling '' with his team during the Storm 's victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening have allowed .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team after his team 's victory in the final against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night had made . He called the game a `` poster child '' for rugby league and said that the two Queensland is not `` too good '' in the struggle .
The Tacklimg Bellamy defended his team and said that they were only focused on the tack-on their `` Contact . ''
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainer on his team confident with him , because it means that they were worried that the Storm team to be beaten .
`` It comes up time and time again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling than they have beaten us 24 : 2 , '' Bellamy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed throughout the year in our defensive system or the techniques , but we have made over the last six weeks our contact in football makes a real focus , and this has provided us with the turnaround .
Trent is now there for three years , and he has obviously losing to a great team , so he is probably not used to it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
It 's funny how it always comes up at this time of year .
Bellamy Bennett 's idea has attacked the `` exciting football '' and his mentor recalled that Bennett 's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with `` long '' because of football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night game and how exciting it was , `` Bellamy said .
I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take a shit dirt .
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
This is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kind of players .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his type of football - not every team two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt has , so that they can play like this .
I build stronger confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
Six weeks ago , they have probably not thought of us when it came to the big games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the game against Storm ROOSTERS achieved a higher score than the Broncos game against the Cowboys .
The game of the Broncos was a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game 20 : 18 , it was two more attempts in our game , but this is an exciting game ?
Make or breaks are no points and exciting ?
For me , it is the game plans .
If they say to us , it means that we will be taking in a period still on it .
The Storm team has released this weekend , as they have won the right to either North Queensland Cowboys or the quiet surrounding the Sharks next Saturday night at AAMI Park to receive Vorfinale . The ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning .

Peter Moody claimed that stewards attempted to spy on him and threatens to end the racing
Peter Moody claimed that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to end the race immediately .
He appealed to the stewards and the Integritäts Department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race-day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , as the positive cobalt-swab sample at Lidaris was that he could not explain .
He had 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want it to look like `` high-hanging grapes . ''
`` I was going to say nothing about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , Moody said .
You know that it went further .
Sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I 'll go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to walk with my head held high , and I want my owners think that I will try my best for them .
If they start to think , I am not doing that , then I should no longer be coach .
Then I have to think about what I do with my license .
Previously , Moody 's had the bomb in an interview with racing.com high let go that the Integritäts department tried to spy on his stall .
`` Eighteen months ago , Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man , whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables , in order to provide information about what I am doing in my stables , '' Moody said on Racing .
You seem to believe that I am a cheater .
If that is the case , surely they should be on their noses because they have failed in an attempt to catch me .
Robert Roulston , former chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , President of RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of RVL , were aware of at the time and it still is today .
This should bring me to the view that it will personally ?
The RVL Hat behave cowardly and perhaps people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I so bad for the industry ?
Perhaps the people out there thinking that I am there .
Maybe they have to give me my license and I run , and I have no doubt that what I say , think about it .
But I am now at the point where it is no matter to me , and that makes me sad .
This makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The levels of the trainer is to have the long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari , and the late scratching meant that he said that he was `` his license could throw on the table . ''
Moody , best known for its preparation of the master 's unbeaten Black Caviar , described the race-day treatment rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or clay on the horses legs had been applied , which was against the rules .
`` It is against the rules of racing .
I have to take the full responsibility for it , `` he said .
`` One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg .
So it would have been last night .
It would have been all day yesterday , which was the case .
But it was also so on race day .
Moody with a three-month disqualification for the treatment to be confronted with the pack on race day , and opened an investigation into this matter .
It is a joke .
People who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse .
`` We all understand that we need rules , but here they have gone too far , '' said Moody .

EU wants to limit mercury in carnivorous fish double
The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and consumers expect a significantly higher dose of nerves gifts .
The consumer organisation Food Watch , submitted a working paper of the European Union , sharply criticized the plans : `` The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policies with full force passed on pregnant women and young children , '' said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of the Watch .
Wolf Schmidt , the limits of the nerve poison should be increased for large fish at the end of the food chain such as swordfish Hai- or for `` economic reasons '' from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
Large predators are already burdened with so much mercury that approximately 50 percent of the catches should be based on the current limits have not yet sold .
After doubling the limit then only 14.5 % would be unsaleable .
In return , the EU wants to tighten this easing in food Watch the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams of 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
Food Watch described it as a `` trick '' because smaller Fried fish , such as carp are usually charged so low that they already comply with the proposed limits .
The reduction of small fish is therefore a perfides diversionary tactic that helps the economy alone , `` said Wolf Schmidt .
Mercury is highly toxic to humans , a heavy metal that accumulates in the food chain , especially in carnivorous fish .
Therefore , the federal government warns that `` even small amounts can cause great damage to the nervous system in the unborn . ''
The Federal Ministry for the Environment said on its website in relation to the current levels , but that a `` health risk to the general population '' is not expected .
Mercury mainly by the burning of coal in the environment .
The German coal-fired power plants to meet a written information of the German Federal Ministry for Environment at the Green members Anna Lena Baer wanted more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two-thirds of the total issued in Germany .
The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was `` permanently and all the '' mirror `` in March exceeded '' from the paper , was quoted as saying .
In the past year were Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish is already among the most common reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF .

At their most anticipated meeting in years Fed strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran-mahogany table , to decide whether it is time , for the first time in almost a decade to raise the federal funds rate .
Loom over them at one end of the ornate , two-story meeting hall there is a mural of the United States .
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues on the economic interests of the nation above all other things to do .
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : The US employment and keep prices stable here .
But since the Great Recession , the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate : Financial stability .
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision , which is too close to predict , it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to start , from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 to be weaned .
Although most of the economic data show that it is solid , the recent turmoil in global financial markets already cautious Fed officials are fearful that this volatility by increasing the interest rate for Bunds to increase - if only by a quarter of a percentage point .
`` Obviously , the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing they '' observe , Lindsey M. Piegza , Chefökonomin at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co. , said
`` But I think if they were looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate is not the increased uncertainty is to wait around the global market enough justification to continue , '' she said .
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what insecure themselves in the financial market .
About half of the economists who were recently surveyed by Bloomberg , have forecast a rate hike this week .
The financial markets expect a wait of the Fed , with a key indicator , showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates , unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points , or 1.4 % to 16.599,85 .
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed 's policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed raise rates at this time would be , `` he said .
If it does , `` they would have to go very far in its statement to calm the financial markets , so that they do not end up in panic . ''
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
Even a month ago , the Fed seemed well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States .
Yellen had in the spring and early summer said that this year , despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would require an increase in the rate expected .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labor market has been solid this year .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years , and close to the levels that the Fed considers full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And although inflation is below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed officials said that the main reason for the temporary impact of sharply lower oil prices .
`` The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labour market , '' Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said .
But the financial markets around the world together zuckten late last month , after China had devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16 % below its all-time high , as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth .
The market has recovered somewhat this month , while the Dow is now down by almost 10 % lower than in May .
The Fed representatives influence the market turbulence , the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates .
`` If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks had not occurred , they would attract the reins in this session , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve .
Now he predicts that it will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the impact .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , '' said Oliner .
The health of the global economy is not the main concern of the Fed , so technically they should not be involved in their decision-making .
But in the end , the Fed has become monetary authority in the world .
The influence of the central bank was enormously in recent years .
The mere hint of then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed 's monetary expansion could `` narrow '' triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , representatives from the Fed can be expected to not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts advise to get a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision-making is `` more art than science , '' Zachary Kara Bell , head of global strategy , said the asset management firm Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA. , said this month that `` the Fed has a history of over-reactions to financial market movements that have apparently not associated with the economic fundamentals . ''
Lacker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is campaigning for a rate hike , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings `` despite limited visible impact on growth in the United States , '' Lacker said .
A year later , the Fed representatives made these cuts .
The Fed should only include aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse in the first place , Adam S. Posen , a former member of the committee , said the interest rate set by the Bank of England .
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level , he said .
`` You will certainly not get into a situation where they fear a rise in interest rates , because the markets '' are concerned , Poznan , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , said .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe that they should jump ahead of time .

The Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack must be Goal.com
Wenger told Goal.com stressed that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he ca n't play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario means that Goal.com will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given his history , his participation in next summer 's European Championship will still uncertain .
The great shame in this current problem is that the Goal.com had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then was back to his old swing found during the early season .
This kind of `` threat of injury is not the career , '' Wenger said .
It is a bone that has not healed well .
This is not a major issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not linked to his ankles , or with the injury he had before .
That may be true from a purely medical point of view , but also , as Wenger acknowledged , there is the risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
It also developed an unpleasant pattern .
The investigation of Premier injuries Ltd 23 different diseases from Goal.com recorded since his debut six years ago .
He also played in just 65 of arsenal 157 league games in the last five seasons .
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs , who have had the most injuries .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season .
`` Sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain power struggle , '' said Wenger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabilized , I am confident that he will do it and go through a career of the sort that he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday , and Wenger is a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start .
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
`` I try to keep the balance and the players who need to get a little breather , '' Wenger said .
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress from Group F , the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe .
Dynamo is unrivalled , even after 41 games after the `` invincible '' campaign was launched in the last season .
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale .
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes that Arsenal , the lesson from the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco has taken and will continue to be driven by the distant hope , with his management of the club to its first UEFA Champions League triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '' Wenger said .
It has never worked at Arsenal .
In 2006 , we were very close , but on the other hand , I am long enough in the business to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .

`` Each EU member must complete its obligations , otherwise the system will not work , '' said Györkös Znidar .

Through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates were all night , around 500 kilometers away from the Macedonian border with Serbia .
`` We have heard that Hungary has closed down , so the police told us that we should go here , '' said one of the refugees .
You wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
So could it actually to observers already predicted shift of previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a nearby stretch a little further .
Croatia : `` Comprehensive opportunities for border control . ''
Croatia 's Interior Minister what had previously said that his country had prepared in case of a large influx of refugees , the plans for possible emergency situations .
He gave no details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member `` comprehensive opportunities for border control ' .
We carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership of the Schengen area .
Slovenia this since 2007 , the EU partners provide the country consistently since a testimonial to what the standard of border controls .
On the Serb side about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
According to Belgrade media reports they had spent the last night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings and Horgos Backi Breg continue to be blocked completely .
Whether the remaining refugees want to move now to the Croatian border , is still unclear .
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Horgos : He thought the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , is premature .
It would not be very large numbers of refugees .
It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Aides to migrants - dangerous - alternative routes rates
However , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps where alternative routes are drawn by Croatia .
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless , however : In parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia has still not cleared minefields .
On Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern was sent to the border region .

Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with a crown of thorns ( gold ) is one of the main works , Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus old post has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not in the Otmar-Alt-Bible , now with splendid images appeared .
In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt , who has put in 150 designs his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
His `` language '' with bright colors and fanciful shapes , the 75-year-old - but what is not synonymous with `` funny '' pictures .
On the contrary , in line with the relevant issues , which may seem pretty bleak .
Roughly three years , Otmar Alt worked on his Bible Project , for which he has a subjective artistic choice from the many areas of the `` Book of Books '' .
Born cycles that address issues such as crossroads , plagues , bids or Our Father .
So has he spontaneously several partners fascinated : This applies to the Luther-publisher with his theological orientation , as well as for the Kettler-Verlag , with its focus on art books .
And since the author Klaus old post office , who has worked on the basis of the painting with the relevant biblical passages is especially .
He has interpreted the Bible chosen by Otmar Alt , and so to the present day , in the current context `` translated . ''
These texts are like verbal mirror of Alts painting .
They are embedded between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and a set of the artist , his own personal thoughts on the situation .
The jewellery cover has golden letters .
This allows the 75-year-old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high level of intimacy .
Emotions were the trigger for the Bible Project : Otmar Alt , 1940 in Wernigerode , born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that the strict Protestant doctrine-Order .
`` As the education was '' already with the cane , Otmar Alt remembers .
`` I tried to come to terms with it , to stand by me , perhaps with the father . ''
His second concern was to help the arts in faster time to value : `` The perception of visual worlds today is dominated by advertising , and it is loud .
Symbolism is out there .
Artists have a different pleasure and joy to show things .
Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
`` In this respect , I am a dinosaur .
Otmar Alt wants the viewer into the images `` fall '' are allowed to work , discover and feel the power they have : `` The picture is looking for his counterpart . ''
Klaus post confessed on Tuesday during the presentation of the Otmar Alt-Bible-in-Otmar Alt-Foundation , `` has always been a lover of Otmar Alts art was to be : '' I like how he sees life with his images. ``
Old did not care to fully understand the Bible , but the key for him , even mysterious issues .
`` This was no cooperation on an equal footing , '' the post says : `` This is about the images , the text merely explained . '' It was a Bible .
For Hans Möhler from Luther-publishing this book is an invitation to `` deepen his life and find freedom . ''
Otmar Alts images speak for Möhler ( biblical ) both the language of love and responsibility .
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , on 15 November in the Otmar Alt-Foundation will be opened .

Four times the increase in use of hand disinfectant by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 , the strong alcoholic hand disinfectant swallow , the Georgia Poison Center .

`` Children are becoming more common on these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them will end up in the emergency room , '' Lopez told CNN .
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectant , while some do it to impress their friends or because of an Estonian in social media .
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers disinfectant drink only because of a cheap experience .
Young people are supposed to be mixed with disinfectant mouthwash containing alcohol to get a hard drink .
Younger children can be attracted by attractive aromas of disinfectant .
`` A child does not think that this is bad for it is , '' Lopez said .
Many of the more attractive ( hand-disinfectant ) are the ones who are perfumed .
It disinfectants with textures , its orange scent , the children are very appealing .
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
Particularly in infants just a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning .
`` It is '' highly concentrated alcohol , Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the hospital of the University of Kansas , the broadcaster told Fox 4 in Kansa City .
So , you would be standing around a sip of whisky , but people make these hand-disinfectant within reach of children , and if children are involved , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splash of strawberry scented hand disinfectants in the school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , two times higher than the threshold for an adult is considered legally drunk , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency room doctor and , in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
Nhaijah lallte their words and was not able to go , when she arrived in the emergency room .
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children 's hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had alienated , Ritchey said .
`` It was very scary , Ortoria Scott , Nhaijahs mother , CNN said .
It would be fatal for my child .
Lopez has encouraged parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and hand disinfectants should be stored out of the reach of children .
About alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants have been linked to deaths .
In 2013 , two women in Ontario women died after swallowing of hand disinfectant , which contained a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol , a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol , which has been listed as an ingredient .
In January , three of the planned fourth grade students in the state of New York to poison their `` nasty '' teacher by misconstrued antibacterial products around the classroom , `` it reports a police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished them from their room .
The police saw the foiled plan as `` chatter '' and disciplinary action by the school authority .

You should come in equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
A second instance is also provided for the first time .
It would allow to make appeals against judgments .
So far , the procedure involved agreed among themselves on a referee , an appeal against their sentences , there was not .
In the discussion of the past few months is clear that citizens of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice can not be trusted , `` said Malmström .
In the long term , she wants to work for an international investment court .
Also , for example , there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
The especially large corporations required investor-state arbitration ( ISDS ) is considered as one of the main reasons for the strong opposition in Europe against TTIP .
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice system through which businesses can only compensation at the expense of taxpayers , nullify national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
In the first comments described anti-TTIP organizations like Campact , the EU Commission 's proposals as insufficient .
Criticism that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CETA ) was especially .
The German economy , State Secretary Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a major step forward .
The Commission has to say on the reform of key points , the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers have drawn up .
The old system of private arbitration is off the table .
The French government has welcomed the plans of Malmström .
The European business association BusinessEurope warned to limit the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by it .
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will be completed on Wednesday remained unclear .
The negotiations since mid-2013 .
The issue of investor protection has been discussed but not with the United States .
Originally a framework should stand for the agreement as early as the end of this year .
This date is considered to be no longer tenable .

Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team , but it is still difficult
Against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if the squad that was selected for the tour of England , is a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card .
`` I would not rule out a victory .
Alastair Cook 's side may have less than three years ago , but there are good players of spin in the batting and fielding , and the community spirit is strong ; they will bear no scars of 2012 , only a youthful , positive attitude .
With the ball , Moeen Ali as a spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
In related news : Adam Lyth leaves England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex was .
The decision to leave Adam Lyth , of course , is for me to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire .
In his seven Tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results .
There was no question mark at Joe Root , for example , that led to the nomination - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser .
Long ago , it would have extended the run of Lyth , but he had control of his own destiny .
Hopefully , if he beats out more runs for Yorkshire , another chance .
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even if he is not so good services , and this does not surprise me ; he is first and foremost a team man .
The question of how much time a test-shot man gets to his character , is difficult .
Lyth had seven chances - as Sam Robson got in front of him - while Nick Compton nine .
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away .
The only criticism I can make is that England was Jonathan routine first began in the Caribbean - as Lyth in top shape - but that lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex disaster comes in , and he is a man , and I have .
He is an X-Factor-cricketers in Yorkshire we saw early in this season , when he 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch was what hit us .
He must be at least the same opportunities as those in front of him , but this of course depends on the line-up in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of letting Moeen alongside Cook beat what an extra spin-Bowler and provide four Quicks would receive , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a man could not beat , and this left-handed has already shown that he is a vicious bastard of cricket players .
Moeen has perhaps done his job for his county Worcestershire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop , before he appeared in 2001 as an opener .
He has managed three hundred runs immediately and not looked back .
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner , and in my limited dealings with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
People might look at his statistics , an average of 31 to 35 with the bat and with the ball - and think it 's a punt , but there is no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the Sri Lanka batsman out , as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup .
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience , having played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood for the white-ball stage of the tour and will bring energy and a powerful presence in the setup .
I always felt that he was on the international cricket competition is created , as a player or as a coach , and how he had Mahela insights from which we can benefit .
Sometimes , new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room , even if the messages are consistent with the previously said .
Collys teammate at Durham , Ben Stokes , is not in the One-Dayers , Root received a similar break against Australia and , for my part , I have no problem with that .
Some will not agree , but coaches and team director do not determine the timetable .
And you must remember that their jobs depend on the players from the results .
Such decisions are taken not with a light heart .

8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump should be taken seriously .
Some have tried to brand him as a flop .
Others have dismissed it as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw Donald Trump from the top echelons of surveys , it has not worked ( yet ) .
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump with a double-digit lead , and some begin to seriously ask what it 's chances for the nomination of the real-estate mogul .
Of course , it is still too early in the term .
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that it was at this time in 2011 by Rick Perry 's leadership to the rising Herman Cain , none of which also won only one state in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth economy now see Trump 's perseverance and begin to make their dollars go to overthrow him .
Here are some recent poll numbers , which indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase .
Trump 's popularity ratings have revolved around 180 degrees .
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , showed a poll by Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans , the real estate mogul was positive .
By mid-July , there were 40 percent .
At the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
About three in ten say they have a negative opinion .
And these figures are in early states .
A Quinnipiac-vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump .
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the GOP candidate .
In a CNN / ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they were either `` enthusiastic '' or `` satisfied '' if Trump were nominated .
Only two out of 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the nominee .
Only Ben Carson creates the same enthusiasm about how Trump ( 43 percent say they would be `` enthusiastic '' vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio , with only 21 percent .
On the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters said they were `` dissatisfied '' or `` angry '' when Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate said .
A majority of Republicans see Trump 's temperament is not a problem .
While Donald Trump is widely known for his bombastic and insulting statements is criticized , 52 percent of the Republicans , but Irish voters that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
The same number applies to the first pre-election state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander-in-chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
Still , 44 percent said that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively , and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
If they put their scholars hats , Republican voters think Trump is for real .
When they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week , four out of ten that Trump is the best bet .
This is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP voters had in the past , not the clearest crystal ball .
At this stage in the last cycle , four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry will win the nomination , compared to only 28 % were for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
However , it appears that a large number of GOP voters , Trump 's campaign as a plausible .
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate , Trump still beats almost everyone .
Some experts suggest that the splintered field probably contributes to Trump 's leadership , while the anti-Trump-support to more than a dozen other candidates distributed is diffuse .
But a poll by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates , Trump is reaping the majority support .
He has a 13-point lead over Carly Fiorina , Marco Rubio 14 points before Walker 15 points , 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally , Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points .
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would be the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race .
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have made up their minds .
A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump , saying that they have given their votes .
Of course , much can be done to change that , and no one can really say never to change their opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
Still , Trump 's strongest competitors at the moment , the other outsiders , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say that they have made up their minds are twice as often for Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration .
Since then , Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago immigrants from Mexico as `` rapists '' who called immigration , was the lynchpin in the public discourse on 2016 .
Some are concerned that the bombastic language of Trump crucial Hispanics from the Republican Party will keep and will damage the Neuorientierungs-efforts .
But according to the new ABC / Post poll on Monday said six out of 10 Republicans , with Trump on immigration issues .
So , as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it will also do Donald Trump apparently .
The frustration with the government climbs to new highs .
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson , now accounts for around half of the support from Republican voters , especially by their outsider status .
Six out of 10 Republicans said Monday in the new ABC / Post poll , they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience .
And they are also angry at Washington .
A poll by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago , shows that three out of four Iowa 's Republicans frustrated with the Republicans in Congress are `` dissatisfied '' with 54 percent and 21 percent use extreme caution `` angry . ''

Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and earned according to the president of the Association of Tennis Australia , Steve Healy praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly referred to as the `` Special Ks , '' came through the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters into the spotlight .
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon after his opponent had Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison twice to be separated by the referee , with Harrison stated : `` Kyrgios beat Wawrinka would have to , and I should beat the child . ''
While he was last seen , as he smashed a tennis racquet after a spasm of a potential US Open victory in Group of thwarted , Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind an artist 's Bernard in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain .
`` One thing that I 'm quite ereifere is the fact that , in my view , Thanasi was embroiled in the dispute , '' Healy said .
He has broken a racquet when he Krampfes due to a lost in the US Open , but he is not the first player to make a racket out of frustration with himself has broken , Thanasi and I know well enough to know that he is not proud of .
But , really , he was in the US Open have behaved extremely well , even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
He has a great team around , he has a great family around , and I think he was treated a bit too strict .
He is a very mature 19-year-old , he works extremely hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is respected in the dressing area , he trained hard , he is in good form , he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits .
Healy also supported the decision to take Kyrgios at the important precedent , which starts on Friday , and he describes the `` joint decision '' as a right for all , but he assures the man from Canberra , as an integral part of a long-term return to the team. ``
`` First of all , we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [ Kyrgios ] , Healy said .
And I think that Nick has managed to rise very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , he is rising in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him , we try to explain to him the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think , is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .

Ecumenical hospice help Mannheim has been around for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz threads you might want .
People do their errands , sometimes fast , sometimes a breath .
You control the two stations of the Mannheim auto salons at the Paradeplatz .
City cars .
Vibrant , long life on a lovely late autumn sunshine and four large panels , each with the title `` Before I die I want to ... . ''
The Ecumenical hospice help with this action on its 20-year anniversary and is still faced with mixed reactions .
`` It comes to life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and the people , '' said Josefine Lammer .
The head of the Ecumenical hospice care is the passers-by and available for questions and discussions as the volunteer staff .
While a passerby to chalk up some spontaneous and the phrase `` in my life , '' `` read , '' with the campers in the United States , `` '' stop the war `` or '' not `` suffer long , others are short , read , I say phrases like '' I am not yet so far `` and then go further .
Again , small discussions evolve on the fringes of the action itself , about life , dealing with the dying .
Even Peter Hübinger is on the ground .
`` Only if I am clear that for me comes at the end of the world , I can live responsibly , '' the director of outreach work in Mannheim , which is working with the Caritas Association of Ecumenical hospice help says .
So is this high-profile action on the 20-year-olds .
Not that anyone wants to be on the boards say publicly is understandable , however , because it is a very personal thing .
The issue of death and dying is still fraught with taboos , so the experience of Josefine Lammer , although the hospice movement in recent years have contributed a great deal to allow people to open up .
An assessment that shares Angelika gode cold .
The Sterbe- and mourning companion is one of the volunteers in the first hour .
Confronted by personal experience with the subject matter , they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia .
When the Ecumenical sought help by calling hospice volunteer they have reported immediately and was at the foundation in 1995 .
Gode cold belongs to a team of 45 volunteer - 43 women and two men - the individuals and families in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and hospice in St Vincent .
They are all trained carefully .
Angelika gode cold can deal well with their task and the experience and experiences .
`` I see life from a different point of view , it is precious and appreciate the moment , '' she says .
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and regardless of religion .

Election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll , halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground to her .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 percent previously , while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent ( an increase of 17 percent .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is standing for president , the support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the primaries .
More than five months before the start of the primaries , most Democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates say they will support .
But Clinton 's supporters are more consistent in their choice than the other candidates .
Since the CBS News poll showed Clinton with a range of demographic groups , while Sanders has achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a wide lead among women and moderates , but these canopies have diminished .
Their support for the men has fallen significantly , and Sanders is only 5 points behind .
Clinton 's advantage among Democratic voters under 50 years has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now at the same level .
Clinton still has a big advantage among the older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead over the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage in this group .
About half of the Democratic voters in the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party .
A quarter would support them with some reservations and a further 15 per cent they would only support because she is the candidate .
Six percent would not support them .
Perhaps not surprisingly , that Clinton 's current supporters are particularly thrilled by it .
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton , only about a quarter would enthusiastically support .
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
If Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want to be the candidate , the most common response is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be President ( 13 percent ) and that they are the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Of Clinton 's supporters , including her relationship with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
Support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited .
Since the vice president casts a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - although one-third believes that he should not do it .
If the Democratic primary voters are asked who would be the party for their second choice , Biden is at the top .
For more than half of Clinton 's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sanders .
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton is ahead of Sanders by 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month .
Biden , a second is by far in this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the `` most eligible '' has risen .
Nevertheless , the question of what is more important for a candidate to call Democratic voters questions about eligibility .
Similar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters in the primaries as unacceptable .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates for their party 's primaries provide good results in a number of important characteristics with voters .
Majorities see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy , and with strong leadership .
Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty , Clinton 's strength is in the lead .
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , and 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic voters in the primaries , Clinton , Sanders and Biden are generally ideologically in line with their views .
In all of these measurements , about a quarter of Democratic voters had no opinion of Sanders .
Since questions about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State will continue to be asked , are the most Democratic voters in the primaries is satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions .
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement , while only about one-third are satisfied .
Public opinion on this issue was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , divided .
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy has no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , while 36 percent said that their opinion of her was even worse .
They are mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
Although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall , only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and less than 15 points since May .
62 % of voters do not believe it is an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time , 55 percent of voters nationwide see also Trump as not honest and not trustworthy .
Clinton and Trump , however , get good marks for leadership .
Of the six candidates tested Biden , Carson and Bush are doing best with honesty .
A majority of Sanders looks rather than honest , but as with Carson , many have no opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .

Brown was shocked with disbelief beleidigtem and shouted `` Hoo ! WoW . Okay , '' as the actor 's comments steadied by The Martian .
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and Farr Elly-brothers , on the show to discuss the finalists .

Damons comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the discussion .

In February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards .
`` Albums still matter , '' ( albums ) still have their importance , he said .
Like books and black lives , albums still have their importance .

`` The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group , the leaders said .
Recently , it was announced that Damon is on a list of entertainers , producers and media moguls , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West .
Whether he has accepted the invitation and has already met the Pope , is unclear .

The world is watching , if the US Federal Reserve in two days , Wednesday and Thursday , come together to make the important decision to make , whether for the first time in nearly a decade , the interest rates will be raised or not .
A survey of 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters , found that a little more than half who only last week was of the view that the Fed will do so , now that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent .
It is a historic event , because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero .
`` For the first time , we are moving towards a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero-field and a process of normalisation of interest rates will start , '' said Angel Ubide , chief researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The US economy is in a relatively good performance , trillion will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low level of inflation .
However , the Fed can not ignore the less rosy view of global conditions .
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the evidence suggests that the odds are against such a move .
The decision is at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday will be announced

The Brulljesmacher starting from
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called a show-off .
This property combines some of the billionaire , who wants to be US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for Aufreger .
Whether he is xenophobic , male journalists regard or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy revealed - the candidate for the US presidency falling sharply on the campaign .
It and doing well .
It is also registered in starting in 2008 , where the grandparents of Immobilienmilliardärs Conservator .
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is many in the village in the early 1960s .
Some in the 1200-residents-site is used on dozens of corners with him .
His grandfather came from starting in the Palatinate : Donald Trump , here in campaign mode .
The Kallstädterin Simone spiral shot a film about Trump .
And what the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I think that this is somehow exciting , but are also impressed in their Kallstadter kind not so deeply , '' says Simone spiral .
The native Kallstädterin has an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts shot , including Trump , the Heinz ketchup family .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , comes in `` Kings of starting '' ( 2014 ) , so to speak - by saying that he would be successful if he would live in starting .
The king of hearts , he has put it there .
While there is respect for the power of the family , but also tend to be of the opinion that Trump is `` a bit of a big mouth , '' Wendel said .
As it happens , but the nickname that was starting in the vicinity , `` The Brulljesmacher '' - too high : The show-off , she says .
So Trump comes from the village of a show-off .
The Trump 's success story began in 1885 , when the grandfather immigrated to the United States and opened a restaurant for gold mining .
The cornerstone of the real estate company first land purchases in New York .
But the lives of grandparents was not free of tragedy : Her desire to return to the homeland , the Bavarian state to which it belonged .
He took Trump because he is hewn down once without permission , the director of the Institute for pfälzische history and folklore , Roland Paul , had declared the movie launch .
Trump was the grandson of an `` illegal immigrant . ''
This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of the descendants .
He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
`` As the poltert , is not so appealing , '' says Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant cousin Trump ( `` The grandmother was a born Trump , Grandpa was born Heinz '' ) .
The retired sees the Americans rather aloof , `` he is always so quick-tempered . ''
Does he believe that Trump is ?
`` I do n't think it can , '' says the 72-year-old .
`` He has never cared about much . ''
The boarding house landlady Veronika Schramm Kallstadter as some mentioned that a descendant of the family donated Heinz during a visit to the church organ , which was generally good .

Europe 's refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closing the border , refugees back
Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte from the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and stuck all who tried to come into the country illegally , all with the aim to stop the influx of migrants .
Chaos ensued at the border , as hundreds of migrants have refrained in a no man 's land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation .
The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land along the road between the two checkpoints and built tents and settled there .
But frustrations grew .
As a police helicopter hovered over them , the migrants chanted `` open the borders ! '' And screaming insults against the Hungarian riot police .
Some had food and water in protest .
Serbia 's foreign minister , said that it was `` unacceptable '' that migrants from Hungary were returned , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) will be part of the solution and not a collateral damage .
It must take place in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries , `` Ivica Dacic said in Prague .
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels to agree on a common immigration policy .
However , the ministers agreed that the responsibility for 40,000 people to share the überrumpelten in Italy and Greece had taken refuge , they expressed their hope that finally , next month , or until the end of the year , an agreement was reached that EU states further 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary , would resume .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union , to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent .
Hungary , however , was not his hopes for a speedy action from Brussels or from its neighbors .
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , so that they were able to seal off roads and speeding up asylum procedures .
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto , meanwhile , said that his country also planned to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence along the Serbian border .
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates in the race , the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia , have been used .
In recent months , many war refugees in Hungary from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted , however , that most of the economic refugees are arriving in search of a better life and not war refugees , who are entitled to protection - a view very much at odds with other EU countries , including Germany .
The new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , making the crossing the border or the Beschädigen of the 4-meter ( 13-foot ) high fence which the government along the southern border with Serbia was build to a crime . These laws also give higher sentences for convicted traffickers .
`` Because of the situation caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand , '' said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
We say it very clearly : Illegal border crossing is a crime .
Procedurally , the parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but Associated Press reporters saw heavily armed soldiers at the border with vehicles and dogs for days already .
Gyorgy Bakondi , national-security adviser to Orban , said that 45 people authorities while trying to cross the border caught , 15 others were already penetrated deep into the country .
You come across as they damage the fence , they are now in police custody and the committing of crimes are accused under the new laws .
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a Zugwaggon arrived with barbed wire to close the borders .
Confusion surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , when the Hungarians a small office opened in a metal container , in order to process the data from people and a crowd of people pressed to hineinzudrängen there .
20 managed to get it , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .

In the `` liberation , '' it went to the roof , which will be mandatory for energy reasons - other than the construction plan - under ten degrees .
The volume of the hall will be considerably reduced .
Therefore , a `` liberation '' was necessary because the development plan allows for the roof no `` exceptions '' - whereby the Bern Rieder council usually proceeds with exemption applications rather restrictive .
The physical structures , however , this is not a recurring project : `` We are creating a precedent , '' said Steinberger .

Di Maria is to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö .
Di Maria is making its debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass in Malmö .
Here 's the match report and the response to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course , as Paris Saint-Germain 's Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday .
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG , the French champions on the road , but then they missed a series of chances before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61st minute a Kopfballtor .
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions , because they not only the qualification for the K.O.-Runden , but an improvement on the way to the quarter-final in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs team with real Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of goal , and he was later in the game against his hometown team , and against the club with which he began his illustrious career began back in 1999 , changed .
`` It is not easy to win at home and away in the Champions League , so it is a good place to start looking back , 2 : 0 to win , and to cause problems for our opponents , even if there are certain things that '' over the course of the season , we still need to improve , `` Blanc said .
`` This is a good omen .
We wanted to win and we have won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals. ``
Who returned after his injury in one of three changes to the team back in Paris , at the weekend , a 2 : 2 draw against Bordeaux on home ground in the league could hold , but it was in the fourth minute by Di Maria trumped .
The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man , the PSG to the next level in Europe can take when he last month was taken over by Manchester United , and he hinted at why he in Marco Erzähler TTI pass behind the Malmö-defense ran into it before he passed on Johan Wiland well long into the corner of the net .
If anyone believed , however , that PSG would achieve a great victory , was disappointed .
Malmö , Celtic beat in a play-off to reach this stage , joined by National Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a five-man defence and two deep in the midfield lined up a serious opponent .
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , who passed away at Kevin Music post in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PSG gave themselves sometimes , with some bad passes and poor qualifications , not least from Inter , patzte in no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot .
Nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill , when he brought his players into the game , and it was a pass from Inter , Di Maria turned in a low shot which by Wiland in the 52nd minute was turned past the post ...
The second goal finally came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani . The Uruguayer scored his sixth Saisontor after Inter left flank of Maxwell had been exploited .
That ended any thoughts that Malmö could come back into play , and only a superb intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz was the end result , keep low , before substitute player was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end .
The coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , was later that PSG was a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : `` Our last Champions League game was in December last year .
Since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level .
The qualifying games are not enough. ``
Hats off to Paris !

`` Sono Genetics ' may control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by explosions of sound waves .
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that the threshold of human hearing at high frequencies in order to be heard .
The impetus to work through the involvement of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves .
Further on this subject : Read and write brain activity with light .
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure , called sono Genetics , where ultrasound can be used to create a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure will one day replace the deep-brain stimulation , an invasive procedure , the electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles .
The bubbles , he found that the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the worms .
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures , the TRP-4 called ion channels in the membranes of cells , some of the worms are found .
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , according to a report in Nature Communications .
By ultrasound-controlled nematodes to create genetically modified Chalasani , the worms so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels .
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro-bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified motor neurons .
The procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics , a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to neurons with pulses of light on and off .
But Chalasani said that sono Genetics may have some advantages over this technology .
Unlike light in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain needs to be sent down to low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass through unimpeded and tissue in the brain from the top of the skull .
`` We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible that the human neurons were temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments to make , '' said Chalasani .
Other applications could be on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells , he added .

Now that Viktor Orbán sends many thousands more to us , is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
Instead of helping in the camp at Röszke on the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly brought up the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of National Socialism .
Victim of this policy not only those Austrians , who are now faced with chaos in the border areas .
The countryside will have to conclude that the `` promised land '' that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing more than another refugee camp .
It will be a major challenge , given the continuing flow of refugees and of winter to make us humane conditions for asylum seekers .
And it will be an even bigger - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .

Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better ?
There is one thing that all parents will soon learn : If your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost by heart .
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
As a provider of childcare systems was asked his favorite children 's book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax , published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. / he .
It is a difficult choice , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company super camps , and continues : `` It was funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I read to my children , because it always seems to be an image or a message that we 've been missing . ''
All well and good , except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , but a summary of the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to the relatively short text .
`` In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where all nature is gone and the air is a commodity , is hoping for a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams to win by their desire to see a real tree , '' reads one . Dr. / he was a love interest , whose real name was Theodor / he hostage and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
As if that were n't suspicious enough : The text proposed by Cameron reads , in part , as the summary of the Lorax 's film , on the website of the Internet Movie Database , and so begins : `` In the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams to win . ''
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron the plot of the book is so unfamiliar , hears an unnamed boy , as the local environment by the greedy , trees cases , Thneed knitting Once-ler , despite the protests of the name Lorax , Hock , schnurrbärtigen nature , `` that '' speaks on behalf of the trees , is devastated .
Most likely , it was such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper , The Lorax not 20 times in a row , read to a child .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text probably come from Cameron 's constituency office .
Super camps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron 's staff , but had no further immediate comment .

Munich , Sylt and Co. : The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the most expensive residential Hobookenweg - with views over the North Sea watts .
In the street , a square metre of a thatched roof house costs an average of $ 73,300 .
`` The supply of properties on the island of Sylt is inherently limited , '' reads the study - so why the high price .
A new study shows , in which special situations a square metre costs the most .
Of course , 18,70 euros per square meter for a student room in Munich are not really little .
In contrast to Germany 's top residential locations is the price but as peanuts .

For slightly overweight diabetics can be helpful for weight loss surgery .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes , according to a new study may take at least five years .
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight-loss surgery live longer than those who received non-surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data takes a long time to get something to show , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert in weight loss surgery , an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery .
Weight-loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods in order to reduce the size of the stomach .
You reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
Over the years , have obesity-surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been carried out by people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal is between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , researchers used from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng General Hospital data since 2007 , they have collected in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery , gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those who undergo this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study .
Meanwhile , the BMI was among those non-surgical diabetes treatments were roughly equal at 29 .
Among those who have undergone surgery , with 36 % of the total diabetes disease and at 28 % .
In the medically-treated group disintegrated completely diabetes compared to only one percent , with only about two percent .
In addition , the results were in the control of blood pressure , triglycerides and `` bad '' LDL cholesterol `` generally better in the 'surgical ' group , '' the authors found .
The researchers also monitored the patient 's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c , blood sugar levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
After the surgery , the average hemoglobin A1c levels fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , remained stable at around 8 % .
But this better `` glycemic control '' - as in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - not reflect reduced the mortality rate in five years , so the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year had the bypass surgery group compared to the gastrectomy group lost more weight ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , achieved greater reductions in BMI ( 7.4 versus 5.1 ) and hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( million vs. 16.7 % ) .
While the new study shows no survival advantage for surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Blackstone , of the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix .
In the Swedish study was in obese people who are subjected to an obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years of dying - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
Although the new study no advantage for survival in the surgery patients showed , Blackstone said , it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process .
`` This is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower , '' without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take seriously weight , once the patient with a BMI between 27 and 30 .
`` I think that we wait too long , until we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that a reversal `` as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their body with obesity and diabetes is hard , really hard .

Eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
Eleven years ago I moved and even forgotten 19-year-old into student housing , still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the strained smile of those I 've annoyed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned , can be distilled into eight simple rules .
In the student residences ranging from slightly nerve-wracking up to absolutely terrifying .
It is tempting to chat about : People , where you are coming from , and where you 've taken sabbatical , where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you Marmite `` frankly neither love nor hate , because seriously guys , it 's only a yeast extract hahaha , I 'm in my room .
You breathe through .
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
It steers the conversation and helps you to find the people you would like as opposed to those with whom you do not speak , even if your eyelashes were caught on fire and the fire extinguisher .
Let people .
The rooms of people turning into drink-receptions , movie-night venues and local venues , but they are also the places where people dress up and her underwear back .
Related to this : You do n't start thinking about at the university with a relationship
Introverted get a rough treatment at the university .
Your bedroom should be a haven , but many student residences form a room-to-room-stroll-culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life-long friendship .
It can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
Nothing in the culture that allows you to say , `` I love you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to leave so that I get back the energy that I used for the interaction with you . ''
Try to feel when the marshals is weary of sociability - and you will send an SMS knocking him .
Speaking of knock on the door : Do it .
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a locked door was not an invitation .
He saw some things .
Close friendship by baking .
Since the university at the height of the Back-mania , is the knock on the doors of people with a plate of brownies , less strange than the greeting of the 1950 's `` Welcome to the neighborhood , I 've baked you something . And now , please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . ''
Homemade offer is a good way to strike up new friendships .
Her housemates feel obliged to talk and perhaps eventually will associate your face with a tasty morsel .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
Badly mixed clumps of flour , sugar and fat cause people are sleeping , if you knock on the door .
To steal food , is a common crime in student residence halls .
Of course , the claws of chicken is a theft , but it is the Milchs take a drop in your tea ?
Check with the dairy owner .
The chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook inside .
If someone steals your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my resident who added their milk a detergent to punish thieves .
She is now in prison .
You should not make noise , dissuading people from sleeping or at work .
It is not just a matter of being a decent human being , but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb about the people who sit in the glass house .
A girl in my hall asked her neighbour to ask whether it makes them something a little quieter drum & bass , because it 's three o'clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
They responded with even more loud music .
When they finally stop at 5 p.m. , they let their neighbours kindly sleep two hours before they had their own music blaring , their door graduated and embarked on their three-hour exam .
Would it not be romantic , if your future spouse would randomly collected in the same student housing ?
Conversely , it would be deeply embarrassed if you keep your future as a resident assistant , a special feature to separate them , and then they have to see every day , and maybe see how it moves across all common friends ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way , but if a resident assistant is definitely not your future , try at least to persuade your body a little common sense .
Leave In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has not verschlossenem his keys in his room , the line between having fun appealed and bullying is finer than it seems .
A good prank is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a boomerang .
Submit by hiding a valuable lesson about safety and amusing - but you never to flood someone 's room with toothpaste and shampoo .
You are closing their doors , and put the key in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but you see tackern their possessions on the ceiling not more than twice .

No diet-fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet .
But who wants to pay attention to his slim line , which is not recommended by them more often .
Because mangoes contain quite a lot of sugar - particularly sucrose .
Nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy , they are B-vitamins and vitamins E and C. Especially mangoes contain as much vitamin A and its precursor beta carotene .
Anyone who eats the fruit , thus supports vision , immune and metabolic processes in the body .
When buying mangoes should not be too soft or too hard and pleasant smell .
The shell color alone tells us nothing about how ripe the fruit is , can also taste delicious green mangoes .
They should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days .
Then , of course , they taste pure or sweet dishes .
A mango savoury dishes , but there is a special touch .
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and Colonnata lard and Radiccio .
A Mangochutney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and wild game .

There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus , who want a state of their own .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clashes since the 10th
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but it is a very contentious issue in Nepal , which has been ruled for centuries .
Work on a new constitution since 2008 is on the way , but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
The lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution would come into force on Sunday .

Metcash Bodenständigkeits launches campaign to combat Aldi- invasion
Metcash tries , the IGA stores from Aldi-march in South Australia and Western Australia .
Food wholesaler Metcash has a Bodenständigkeits campaign launched to the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million to defend Aldi-invasion .
While Aldi opening two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as through events such as Adelaide show .
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo from DUNS Borough in IGA stores samples distributed and shopkeepers , the cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
It is expected that Metcash further details of his defense strategy , published on September 29 , when the wholesalers for food , drink and equipment-Strategietag conducts its annual investors .
There is a lot at stake , with South Australia and Western Australia , nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA shops and higher profit margins than the IGA network Metcashs Oststaaten generate .
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in the Oststaaten .
However , as Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi 12 months after opening its first markets will snatch away around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states and all existing players , but mostly independent retailers will take away sales .
In a report published this week shows that the estimated by Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath , IGA retailers $ 360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 , could lose .
This prediction is based on the assumption that in the next year , Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss in food and grocery store and the quantities on Metcash Metcashs high fixed-cost base could be around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr Kierath said .
At the same time is losing market share in the Metcash Oststaaten , mainly at Aldi and Coles , although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs turnover in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund managers today Douglass , founder of Magellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade , Metcash .
Metcash refused to publicly respond to the comments of Mr. Douglass .
But it is assumed that a director of Metcash has contacted Mr Douglass last week .
IGAS is market share since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Metcashs food and food trade , which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers , has fallen by 43 % since 2012 , the operational debt reduction while pressure on sales and margins .
However , the wholesaler is resisting and invested more than $ 150 million to date and sale price with Coles in hundreds of products every week , align and IGA retailers to improve their stores by faster-growing fresh food to improve and better selection of private-label foods .
Metcashs Chief Executive Ian Ferrin says that the price adjustments and store-rehabilitation programs to drive up and hopes that the wholesaler in 2017 for the first time in four years , will return to profit growth .

Why I will be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch a man is put to death .
If it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I am in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State from 1929 , when Richard Glossip will be executed by lethal injection .
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
The invitation was made in January for the first time about his best friend , and even though I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day approached , I began to fear me .
So , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would provide a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to witness executions in the United States , and there are often more applicants than places available , a macabre lottery will be held to decide who will be elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
Whoever is selected , will observe it dispassionately .
I can do that .
I will sit alongside Richard Glos IPS a friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a visit to two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we talk .
The prison authorities say that I was not a witness and can be a journalist , so it will not be allowed me , a notebook and a pen to take to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality .
Here is the lesson .
Tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she `` could have put it better , '' but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
He tells me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
But he wants an international reporter is here to write there .
If he dies , he thinks that the promotion of the movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell , a reporter for the Huffington Post , will sit next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts , which I have done .
I will not go back on all the details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed .
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from this perspective , I am going to see him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn to it .
What you will get from me , is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .

The BBC should give up Eastenders , former head of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as Eastenders and The Voice . He said that commercial rivals `` would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used in order to make the kind of programmes that are not by other UK broadcasters .
He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in solid window against the most popular shows of its rivals and placing of channels such as BBC4 .
After the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company in partnership with other organisations to do , Johnson said that he was six years into his time at Channel 4 have tried , without success , to get in touch with the BBC .
`` I have a problem with the idea that the BBC has commissioned programmes or broadcasts which are clearly non-subsidized rivals would be shown , '' said Johnson , the House of Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep the licence fee , which I consider medium- or long-term is not a good idea , you should at least give its production programs that others do not .
Send The Voice in a prime-time window because they want to reach the broadest possible support for their future .
The idea that no one else would show , this is a joke , it is ridiculous , it is of course nonsense .
Johnson said : `` I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could be funded without subsidies .
The Voice is such a programme , Eastenders is another , admittedly , both in-house productions .
Frankly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings `` because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support . ''
His comments on the BBC 's most popular programmes are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows such as Eastenders should sell .
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programmes to BBC4 `` should go where you can measure the audience not quite , but they do their job , and they can argue if they on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees go , '' Well , of course , we have all these obscure programs that no one has seen. ``
You put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
The broadcasting fee , Johnson told the committee : `` I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value .
Of course , you all think we all think that for £150 per year , here is a great value , but for people who are £150 is a lot of money , whether that is true wonder , because they do n't consume much of the BBC .
The former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to inform , educate and entertain. ``
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be on the public television channels in Australia and Canada are an example of this change to `` inform , educate and entertain . ''
On the issue of partnerships Elstein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , he said that only a handful will be shown on television , and make alliances with commercial channels said to make everything available online .

JVA Berlin-Tegel : Five square metre cell are degrading
The Federal Constitutional Court has an ex-prisoner which role he can fairly given that for months in a small cell was housed .
Because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation , if they are housed in small cells .
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision released on Wednesday .
According to the judges , the parties can even hope to get money , if they were locked up for a few days in tight spaces ( Az . : 1 BvR 1127 / 14 ) .
It was an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : He was in the prison hospital Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space housed ; the toilet was not spatially separated .
After that , the man who , according to his lawyer now been released , had been transferred to a larger cell .
His liability lawsuit because of the substandard conditions of detention against the country failed in Berlin .
But the constitutional judges waived the judgment of the Court of Berlin and had the case back for further examination .
You can see the dignity of the man .
Now the supreme court decides on the amount of compensation
Even if only for a few days in prison days are compensation for legal reasons from the period in question was relevant , given a compensation claim , it said .
Otherwise , its decline is a legal protection of personality `` would be to fear . ''
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation .
The constitutional judges have strengthened in the past often the rights of prisoners .
So they spoke only in April a detainee compensation because he was locked naked in a cell .
Degrading the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is , according to a decision by 2011 .
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday , the German Constitutional Court , which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 , a decent accommodation .
The plaintiff was placed on three months between 15 to 21 hours in the same type of cell , such as in the case of Karlsruhe .
The Berlin prisons had come in recent weeks due to a lack of personnel in the headlines .
Prisoners are locked up for 23 hours , again and again , the increasing aggressiveness , even with beatings , it should be because of the tense situation .
According to the press office of Justice 21 posts in Tegel are not due to defect , 19 , 2016 will be lost .

Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Smokers not only harms the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study in Potsdam .
The good news : The risk of abandonment is falling fast .
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
It emerges from the long-term study by an international team of researchers , including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
Compared to non-smokers , smokers , the risk of losing their teeth prematurely , the 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher .
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants .
Main causes of tooth loss are dental caries and inflammation of the meat , DIfE stressed .
For these periodontitis smoking is a risk factor , the authors say .
The connection between smoking and tooth loss , go back to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers .
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries .
People who stop smoking , reduce their risk , but within a short period of time , `` the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research . ''
However , it could take more than ten years until the threat to sinke back to the level of non-smokers , said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham , England .
We need to convince people to be non-smokers , study director Heiner Boeing from DIfE declared : `` Smoking shortens the life . ''
Not to smoke in the lungs and blood vessels and leads to our knowledge is good to a good dental health well into old age .
In Germany , more than 20 percent of the population over the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness , DIfE said .
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
The new long-term study , the findings untermauere .

Experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
A government-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with ties to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
Experts in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , joined in the Lancet , by Public Health England ( PHE ) in its report on e-cigarettes are used as evidence .
PHE report published the `` principle '' last month and describes him as a `` comprehensive review of the evidence . ''
But some researchers have called into question the reliability of the data , and highlighted the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the `` extremely windy basis , '' reasoned on the PHE his main conclusion .
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the allegations `` on stone or sand build up . ''
Martin McKee , professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . ''
You said that the public expects of PHE 's assertion that `` the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking '' on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling are based .
In fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to make a model of a multi-criteria decision analysis ( Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis ( MCDA ) to develop their opinions about the damage caused by a variety of nicotine-containing products to lead to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health , whose CEO is earlier by British American Tobacco ( BAT ) to have an independent study .
He also signed the credentials of BAT for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that funds from an e-cigarette manufacturers , but not the funding , which he previously after reports from tobacco company Philip Morris International is said to have received , she added .
The reasons for the selection of the members of the Board are not supplied , but that includes several well-known e-cigarette-champions , some of whom even an industry funding in the paper .
Some of the other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
At the meeting , also took the tobacco-of PHE .
The research group `` significantly , '' recognizes that there is a lack of hard evidence of the damage of most products on most criteria , `` wrote , McKee and Cape .
But none of these compounds or restrictions in the PHE report discussed .
McKee and Cape well said that the allegations of PHE that `` there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes as a way of smoking for children or non-smokers '' were premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and wellbeing at PHE , said that it was responding to the allegations by the BMJ earlier .
He said : `` E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . ''
Every second lifelong smokers dies of his addiction .
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison , but we still have to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the health service £2 billion per year .
The clear proof of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking , are we fulfilling our national jurisdiction .

BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its `` dumbing down ''
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals .
He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The bathrooms smelt
House-colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 `` turns '' to Classic FM , a leading member of parliament and new claims increased pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something that the private sector do not .
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham said the BBC bosses that public service radio station `` verdumme '' and increasingly unable to distinguish from its commercial rivals .
`` Radio 3 seems to be - I use the word '' verdummen `` not like - but it seems to turn on Classic FM , '' he said .
He was also on the BBC Music Awards , which launched last December .
The BBC Music Awards , which launched last year , seem to be The bathrooms smelt just under a different name .
So if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you really only `` imitate what is already on the market , said Mr Bingham .
BBC Director-General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and educating the public .
What I learn from Radio 3 , which I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly unmatched .
`` And the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and new works , I think is really important , '' he said .
Earlier this year , Radio 3 controller Alan facilities that should be working harder to engage the audience argued the BBC , as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
Radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production , during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , it came under fire , commercial rivals on the feet .
The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show on the BBC , the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million was purchased .
Take a look at why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - `` on a special BBC way '' was produced .
He added that he wished that the company `` is a hit from our barn , '' when we start the next time an entertainment series .
However , he refused to order for another series of The Voice in the future , or to exclude the fee payers money for other entertainment formats .

Friends : The comedy show that serious lessons about male friendships granted
The lack of similar images in the show is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever , as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high .
In 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common in men than in women .
In a bid to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM - Campaign announced against a pathetic life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim to challenge the culture in question , the men to seek help when they need it .
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the suffering a sufficiently high percentage of friends with `` healthy '' mood , had doubled his chances of recovery are .
For those who are not depressed , cut a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
But , of course , you have to have friends , a friendship can work .
In the age of social media-led communications , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
Our digital lives are lively , strong , and to be successful , doubled , even if , in fact , dominated the isolation .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values ; money , reputation , social status , all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health is much deeper .
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money really ca n't buy happiness .
The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down .
Each character has been defined by his work , but because of his personality , which was notable for the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs , moments when football peering into comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross , Rachel , all of which came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case , even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings .
As an employee of the telecommunications ministry told me : ... `` my audience role for people who are feeling depressed and at risk of suicide , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
The men who contact us , often feel unable to talk with friends .
The old saying `` I get it '' has a huge impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about issues openly. ``
Friends of one of the shows that comes to my mind is when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms .
You clearly presents the small moments of male friendships .
So my objective outsider status over the phone to people in moments of despair , may also contribute to the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so if you visit this weekend , Comedy Central friends decided to celebrate the day with the completely redesigned backdrop , why do n't you take your friends for a drink at the Central Perk .
Or , even better , if you are sitting around in Starbucks alone someone see you give him a smile and say hello .
You never know what difference could make your friendship .
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # friends fixed

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered during the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven a double fracture of his right leg .
While this brought the left side defenders cry and it was ruled out for at least six months from the games , Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw can play again this season .
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute , after the 20-year-old Shaw in the PSV area collapsed .
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
Van Gaal said : `` He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital . ''
He will be moved tomorrow , or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , then it is very difficult and great plays , and then this happens .
In the dressing room , he had an oxygen mask on .
He wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fracture then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group stage .
I hope that he can play again this season .
Moreno was lucky to escape a red card and the imposition of a Elfmeters .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee , was not punished the Mexicans .
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong .
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
It was a very serious attack with both feet .
A tweet on Shaw 's account was : `` Thank you all for your messages , words can not describe how broken I am , my road to recovery begins now , I come back stronger . ''
This Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw related : During the defeat at PSV
The England defender has with the European Championship in France an extra incentive to recover until next June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV coach , said : `` It is a very serious violation . ''
If a player leaves with this kind of violation of the place are all very sad .
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent .
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico against Van Gaals Holland team played in the World Cup in 2014 .
`` It is very difficult because it was not his intention to injure the opponent , and then when you hear that it is a very serious violation , it is not good , '' Cocu said .
For me , it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see the ball , which was in a different direction , so that it looked as if he had touched him [ Moreno ] , but I could not see the attack on Luke .

The plans for a holiday house in the small seaside settlement at Emden beginning to take shape .
The investor presented publicly for the first time plans for the project .
Many local residents are more worried - they fear the selling off of their leisure Sanctuary
For months was negotiated behind closed doors , has been pondered , debated and plotted .
Now the plans are for a new holiday house in the small seaside village near Emden , on the table .
The prospective customer , the medium-sized company Emder `` system-building , '' on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Council Emder his plans publicly for the first time .
Initially this point on the non-public part of the agenda .
Under pressure from critics of the project and the FDP group , the investors and accusing the administration secrecy , Ralf Behrends from system-construction-management on the offensive : `` We have not yet an answer to all the questions , '' he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .

This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming , and the boom will falter , as bond yields will rise , and the economy is sliding into a recession .
What we know .
What we do not know how long it will take and how long it will last .
In particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process .
A recession came in just 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months .
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial system .
Therefore , representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather on the period which is needed for normalization .
In fact , several variables play a role .
In the end , however , market participants could see that all the fuss was exaggerated , perhaps because of a rate increase .
`` The Fed 's first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of '' cheap money , `` Julian Jessop , economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still at a low level , the seismic shock that many seem to fear to lead .
This does not mean that there will be no impact .
Here 's a look based on historical trends , as some sectors of the economy might react :
As the market has seen in the last month , the anticipation of rate hikes could make things volatile for a while .
Once it arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
`` There seems to be a tendency for asset returns of 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be undermined , perhaps again reflecting the delay in monetary policy , '' said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happened after the Fed 's interest-rate increases .
More specifically , the market is mostly over the last 35 years in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to a rate hike , pretty flat over the next 250 days ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average rate of return over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent , according to a recent analysis , Bob Doll , chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , published in Barron 's .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle , and thus increase the yield begins to decrease .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but they often promote interest rate hikes .
In the current case , the Fed is faced with a number of conditions , which did not exist before and which could hasten a recession .
Most remarkable is that GDP is near its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed .
According to Deutsche Bank 's nominal GDP stood at 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950 under 4.5 percent .
Although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 per cent , only a few , and we expect that this will continue in the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed just 1.5 percent .
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of `` whether it is different this time , '' said Deutsche Bank .
Market participants throughout the year on a rate hike by the Fed have been taken , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee addressed this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC increased could approve during this session , the futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
`` In our study , all have cycles increase from 1950 to today in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade provided , '' according to the report .
In contrast , this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
The current cycle is by far the longest , the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and there have been 74 months .
The fixed income was also volatile , because the market is anticipating a rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks if the change their strategic direction .
With bond yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle .
At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields fall , Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Schwab 's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause bond yields between longer and shorter closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve .
High-yielding bonds often bring better returns in such a climate , although `` we are still cautious , to expect higher yields , '' said Kathy Jones , fixed-income analyst at Schwab , in an analysis .
It is interesting that Jones believes that the markets are already in Fed policy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has changed , '' she wrote .
Short-term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit spreads have widened and volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market , when the Fed tightened its strategy .
By and large , companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US , will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive .
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of their debt .
`` History shows that '' quality `` stocks tend , three months after an initial rate hike to respond very positively , '' Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients .
Companies with strong balance sheets have surpassed companies with weak balance sheets after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , on average , by 5 percentage points .
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with lower quality ( by an average of 4 percentage points ) , and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debt is a big problem .
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Goldman said .
Outside of the pure stock games consumers also will benefit from the rising dollar .
Savers could see profits through higher yields , although experts are divided on how soon that will happen .

Jewelry will net curtain - `` top as a fashion niche
Previously , it was the long embroidery machines in Plauen to make yards .
The embroidered fabrics and lace in large quantities for customers who , for example , processed them with blankets and curtains .
That alone no longer works , Andreas Reinhardt , CEO of fashion tip Plauen explains .
Instead , the fashion is important .
In the early days of the `` top fashion played a major role , was then replaced by the home textile industry - and now being rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt cites some examples : Lead in jewellery , accessories such as handbags and in regional costumes .
Put all the so-called vintage fashion , which in past eras , a growing job potential .
Anyone who served in the textile industry in Germany is not a niche that is no longer on the market .
With us , they already account for half of all orders .
Fashion tip Plauen is a member , along with nine other companies in the industry association `` lace and embroidery .
Only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
In the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales are there .
Private shops and wholesale , there is almost no more .
Our products reach the customers in this way .
Today 's mass-produced goods will be cheaper in Asia and sold almost exclusively on chains .
In addition , the export schwächle , after Russia and the United States .
So plenty of reasons for new ways .
The industry association is trying to score points by environmental awareness , as Cordula Bauer said of the stick pearl in Falkenstein : `` Since this year , we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable manner . ''
Reinhardt added : `` This also refers to the materials used . ''
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the snow Berger of West Saxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace .
To counter the competition from Asia , you need to find high-quality and innovative products .
It takes time and courage .
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and companies , especially the need to think economically , `` says Schmidt .
Therefore , an existing design will often vary only slightly to keep a customer base .
A few years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic pyramid top .
The machine uses small beads in some places .
The Goldsmiths `` champion Bianca Hall Bach did it inspire Krauße became : '' Before , I could n't deal with traditional `` top . ''
Now she uses the snowball head for her jewelry .
In an elaborate procedure it shapes the pattern in silver .
`` Many people in the region to identify with the subject '' tip - young and old , `` says Reuter .
It also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento .
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of `` tip .

Terraced houses for refugees , single parents , low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
So , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : `` Wohnhraum need not only refugees , but also the single mother and the low earners . ''
`` I show how you still can build cheap and good , '' says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees are pushing on the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : He builds in a project terraced houses for refugees .
Mr Gildner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability .
Because the people here are to a large extent .
In view of the refugees , we also need enough housing in the next few decades .
A very facile , three-storey terraced house is the solution .
Gildner : A terraced house needs less space .
It facilitates the integration .
It is different when you are among the people who live in apartment buildings .
Each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project , consists of three apartments , each for four asylum seekers .
Each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
It may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back .
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs .
What is the cost ?
Gildner : The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000 , without a plot .
This is manageable .
Took six months of construction .
This is appropriate .
The building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gildner : Planning , I have learned through my project .
Particularly complicated there is always the looming sword of Damocles and expect the pitch regulation .
Creepy. ``
It is still assumed that anyone who creates in a terraced house with three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
Only in the cities of the lack of space .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How did the residents reacted to her terraced house project ?
Gildner : There were those who have accused me of creating luxury housing for asylum seekers .
What is definitely not true .
But you do not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : It is true that we have had in the last five years , a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that can afford a little more .
My project has the message that the ordinary people need housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low earners .
I show how you can still build cheap and good .
That is what it is .

Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep !
The ads shame Britain 's arms trade
Amnesty International anti-arms trade fairs-video .
Terrible killer-drones !
Ankle zerschmetternde leg shackles !
Cluster bombs !
And electric shock sticks , causing the nagging pain , but leave no trace !
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world 's biggest arms fair is a combative parody , which was produced by Amnesty International , the willingness of the British government in the spotlight to bring arms to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International event at the ExCeL Centre in London 's Docklands to bestow gifts .

In September , a swarm of arms dealers will take the DLR ... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair .
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland .

The Amnesty video was more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , the non-profit organization with the graphic designer and voiceover artist , who also works for free .
VCCP-creative director Matt Lever was astonished by the silence around the advertising of the arms fair - there was a lacuna in the ExCeL-calendar - and thought : `` We give them the campaign that they try to avoid . ''
They played with the invention of a more realistic dodgy corporate advertising , but `` by the dinned into with bright colors and animation , it remains more liable . ''
`` You have done a fantastic job in helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the exhibition to raise , '' says Tom Davies , of Amnesty .
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not traded on our doorstep is illegal .

Jeremy Corbyn 's debut at the Prime Minister 's Question Time
Since his election , Mr Corbyn 's debut is expected at the Prime Minister 's Question Time with
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to his debut at Prime Minister 's Question Time , and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Corbyn will gather for the first of his six questions set out shortly after noon , with his performance of the media and probably the Labour MEPs will be examined closely .
He called for `` less theatrical and more facts '' at this weekly event .
He has also said that he could skip some meetings to leave to colleagues .
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn 's leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC 's annual conference on Tuesday .
In the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain to remain in silence , criticism from a number of Tory most recent provoked and is at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyn 's decision not to sing the national anthem , has drawn attention to
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had `` stood in respectful silence '' and he had acknowledged the `` heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . ''
But a member of Mr Corbyn 's shadow cabinet , Owen Smith told BBC Two 's Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader , to sing the national anthem , `` independent '' of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn 's top team , and they rely on differences in economic , defense and foreign policy , while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader .
The BBC 's political correspondent Robin Charles says that political differences within Labour `` pile up '' after Mr Corbyn 's comments on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits .
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour changes present to the whole idea of a limit to remove altogether .
Hours later , said Mr. Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister , that the party was `` very clear '' that it was only against the government 's plans , the cap of £26,000 to £23,000 .
Mr Corbyn is the fifth to be Labour leader , David Cameron , the Tory leader , in the last decade at the Dispatch Box in the House , is facing .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says that he `` Crowd-sourced '' ideas for questions for Mr Cameron , he has more than 30,000 comments were made .
The Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister 's Question Time is too confrontational , and that he will both repartee `` and refrain from arguing with the barbs and has instead decided to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business minister , will represent him , if he does not take part - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
He has also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues speak occasionally , and that he had contacted John Bercow , the Speaker of the House of Commons , to discuss the problem .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is out of politics in the style of a `` Ditherer-theatre '' to remove , which is often associated with the Prime Minister 's Question Time , but a few years later , he admitted that he had failed it .
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons , and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that she had become a caricature , and needs far-reaching reforms .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : `` We create the ''
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to adopt them .
What lies ahead for Germany ?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come after predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year after Germany , according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) is even able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination , given the unusual challenge : `` I say again and again : We can do this , and we do it . ''
What is in store for Germany , conveys the following overview .
Used to be , according to various estimates between 350000 ( estimate ) and the German Federal Ministry of 400,000 ( estimate of Pestel Institut ) homes a year - and the next five years .
That is almost twice as much as previously ( 250000 homes will be built .
Dramatically , however , is the lack of housing , especially affordable rental properties : 60000-80000 per year falling out social housing from the rental price , and the affordable housing will apply as refugees .
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) intends to double the funding , currently 518 million to one billion euros .
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel-Institute : 80 000 social housing should occur annually , and the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year .
Agree scientists and federal minister of construction is that it must also give more tax benefits for investment in housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the countryside can be employed in Germany in the long term .
However , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications , in order to help them start , criticised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation .
For the integration of refugees is crucial , however , whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the host society , but also the self-esteem of immigrants , migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt says .
In Germany , according to Thränhardt , there has been a political shift : The work ban for refugees on the recognition of work .
While there was once a work ban on asylum seekers for up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement limits the asylum seekers to a place of residence .
In the view of society - is also due to the shortage of - mostly enforced that refugees should be allowed for faster access to the labour market .
A big hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of German .
So far , there is still no sufficient supply of general and work-related language courses .
Moreover , studies show that most jobs are conveyed through personal contacts .
The development of networks is , therefore , in the opinion of Thränhardt the royal road to integration .
The Berlin school administration has noted that few parents from giving their children in day-care centres , there are an estimated 10 to 15 percent , `` for the displaced parents is very important to keep the family together , '' says Ilya Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
However , in order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita , managing leaflet distributed in different languages .
The demand for teachers is rising due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example , by not allowing multiple schools .
In countries without knowledge of German pupils in classes to be prepared for the classroom .
But they are not always taught by fully qualified teachers , but , as in Berlin , also from teachers who have a qualification in English as a second language .
There is no shortage of them , Beate Stoffers says of the Berlin school administration .
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle , no state asylum seekers or indulgent prohibits the study - the only exception Berlin interior senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has so far but now has abandoned its stance .
Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitated access to university .
As refugees with a stay of reimbursements or receive no benefits under the current law more asylum seekers when they begin their studies .
The latter have basically no Bafög , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to trainees .
Refugees waited until now had to have lived in Germany for four years , in order to be Bafög-entitled , from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months .
This funding gap needs to be closed , Steffen crash , Berlin 's Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studentenwerk .
The students should immediately get Bafög .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
Islam , the state should grant the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state-church law to a new state-religions-relationship develop .
Also important is the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association , the professional cares for the newcomers .
To the rights and obligations .
The representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some control .
This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Ayman Mazyek , said on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany .
Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany have , `` for her right now , here , in Germany , forfeited , he said in the Bavarian Radio .
He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
Integration in the future will be much more so than today , be a matter of the whole society .
The majority of society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Germany has , as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade , an anti-discrimination and a general equality law .
But it is very slow , as the spirits-murder series showed that the police and authorities are systematically ignored the racist motive .
Equal opportunities for all : What migrant organisations and stakeholders not white German demand for a long time and which require international agreements such as the anti-racism convention , must become a reality in the next few years , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens to exploit their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
In general , Germany was able to provide the expected refugees medically , doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says .
`` As far as a power and capacity , we create that , '' he told the Tagesspiegel .
However , this extra money to flow into the system .
In order to avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery wants to distribute to all arrivals when registering for health cards .
Services could be charged later with the Länder .
And in the long term , it is highly questionable to fob off so many people with limited services , the law stipulated that asylum seekers performance .
Otherwise , the doctors make the language barriers .
Until now , the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are informed about their illness worse than other patients .
Not only in clinics , in doctors `` offices interpreting costs would have to be accepted , she says .
Many refugees would be helped but also with more general medical correspondents in emergency ambulances .
And with a different diagnostic .
Among refugee children , for example , there are significantly more untreated disabilities , and young people go for HIV awareness .
With some of the other diseases German doctors would come from their training , but clearly , Montgomery says .
`` Parasite infections or tuberculosis are not so difficult to discern . '' And as far as the shortage of doctors , even through the refugees might be relief in sight .
The Syrians have a highly developed education system , many refugees are even doctors .
In order to be able to practise , but they would have to prove their qualifications and may drop again .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany , according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists ( BPtK ) mentally ill , most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable , said Dietrich Munz , President of BPtK .
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany .
Anyone who is suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder , among other things , suffers from so-called flashbacks with breathlessness , dizziness , palpitation and Todesängsten .
Other symptoms of sleep and concentration , strong shock and emotional numbness .
In order to prevent the symptoms would be chronic , early treatment needed , Munz said .
So far , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy .
While mentally ill asylum-seekers in the social services can make a request for psychotherapy , but the process usually takes several months .
In addition , officers or doctors who are trained for mental illness would not usually in the social services , decide whether or not a therapy is necessary .
This often leads to miscalculations , Munz said .

The former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop programmes such as EastEnders and the voice send . He said that commercial rivals `` her right arm would give '' for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programs which will not be sent by other UK broadcasters .
He criticized the BBC for that to place public service programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , highly controversial window against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4 .
After the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said , the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years during his time at Channel 4 without success to come with the BBC in contact .
`` I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes commissioned or sends , which would also clearly of non-subsidised rivals , '' Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee within the framework of his inquiry into the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep the licence fee , which I in the medium or long term not consider a good idea , you should the others not to make its production at least on programs , or Commission .
They send the voice in a prime time , because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it 's ridiculous , it 's nonsense , of course .
Johnson said : `` I do n't see why a regressive tax funded programs could be financed without subsidies .
The voice is such a programme , EastEnders is an another , admittedly both in-house productions .
Frankly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I try to see how this is to be public television .
I do n't think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame in the hunt for reviews `` because of the ambitions of the people of who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support . ''
His comments to the BBC 's most popular programmes reflect that the former head of sky , Tony Ball , in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows such as EastEnders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public niche programs `` should go to BBC4 , where you pretty much ca n't , measure the audience but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion £ licence fees go , '' well , of course , we have created all of these obscure programs that no one has seen . '' ''
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see her .
To the licence fee , Johnson told the Committee : `` I urge you to find who can get the best value from it a more regressive system in terms of conditions .
Of course , you all think we all think that one for £150 per year here a great value for the 150 gets , but for people , £ is a lot of money , wonder if that 's true , because they consume much of the BBC .
The former sky and channel 5 Chief David Elstein , who testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review their Reithian mission `` to inform , to make and to entertain '' .
He said little of the BBC production would be classified officially as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and she should take on the public broadcasters in Australia and Canada an example this change to `` inform , educate and entertain '' .
On the question of partnerships , Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , which he said that only a handful of TV shows and with commercial channels enter alliances , to make everything available online .

EU wants to double mercury limit in predators
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and the consumers expect a much higher dose of the case .
The consumer organisation Foodwatch , which there is a corresponding working document of the EU , sharply criticized the plans : `` risks and side effects of misguided industrial policy and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant women and young children '' , explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch .
Wolfschmidt according to the limits of the nerve for big fish should be raised at the end of the food chain like about shark or swordfish for `` economic reasons '' of one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
Large predatory fish are contaminated with mercury that 50 percent of catches can not be sold on the basis of the force limits about but already today as strong .
After doubling the limit values , then only 14.5 percent were not for sale .
In return for this relaxation of the EU according to Foodwatch wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
Foodwatch called this but `` Trick '' , because smaller coarse , like about carp usually as low charged , that they already comply with the planned maximum levels .
The reduction in small fish is therefore `` a perfidious diversion , that alone helps the economy '' , said Wolfschmidt .
Mercury is a highly toxic for the human heavy metal which greatly accumulates through the food chain , especially in predatory fish .
Therefore the Federal Government warns that `` even small amounts especially in unborn damage of the nervous system '' can cause .
The Federal Environment Ministry declared on its website in terms of the existing maximum levels , but that a `` health threat to the general population '' is not to be expected .
Mercury passes mainly through the coal combustion in the environment .
The German coal-fired plants bear buck more than six tons emit mercury according to a written report of the Federal Ministry of environment to the Green Member of Parliament Anna Lena in the year , two-thirds of the total emitted in Germany .
The concentration of mercury in fish around in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is `` permanent and nationwide exceeded '' , had quoted in the March from the paper `` The mirror '' .
Last year , Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF .

Met cash launches Bodenständigkeits campaign to combat Aldi-invasion
Met cash tries to protect the IGA stores before an Aldi March in South Australia and Western Australia .
Food wholesaler met cash has launched an Bodenständigkeits campaign , the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a 700 million $ to defend Aldi invasion .
While Aldi opening two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers met cash and IGA supermarkets and build the brand IGA by mainstream marketing and marketing on the social media , through events such as the Adelaide show .
IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker Samir from Dunsborough samples distributed in IGA stores and store owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
It is expected that met cash released more details of its defense strategy on 29 September , when the wholesaler of food , alcohol , and equipment performs its annual investors strategy day .
There is much at stake because South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of met cash 's IGA stores and IGA network in the Eastern States to generate higher profit margins than met cash 's .
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia , and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to 14 percent in the Eastern States .
However , believe analysts like Morgan Stanley that Aldi twelve months after opening its first stores around five percent of the food market in these two States will snatch and all existing actors , but mostly independent retailers sales will take away .
According to a report published this week estimated the analyst Tom Kierath by Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers $ 360 million sales per year and met cash 250 million $ could lose by the end of 2016 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opened 25 stores next year in United States and 30 in WA and a turnover of 500 million $ 600 million and $ will achieve in each market .
The loss in the food and grocery store and the quantities to met cash 's high fixed cost base could met cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and tax costs , said Mr. Kierath .
At the same time , met cash loses market share in the Eastern States , to Aldi and Cole 's , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley assumes that sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 per cent will be met cash in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in the year 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
Last week the leading Fund Manager Hamish Douglass , the founder of Magellan financial group , at a business lunch in Melbourne , told that met cash will likely disappear within a decade . met cash .
Met cash refused to publicly respond to the comments made by Mr. Douglass .
But it is assumed that a Board member of met cash last week has made contact with Mr. Douglass .
IGAs market share has declined since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from met cash 's food and food trade , which supplies 1,200 IGA retailers , has fallen since 2012 by 43 % , reflecting operational debt reduction for simultaneous pressure on revenue and margins .
The wholesaler resists , however , and invested more than 150 million $ , to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster-growing fresh food and to provide a better variety of private-label foods .
Met cash 's Managing Director Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and loading clean-ups to Elan will grow and hopes that the wholesalers will return again in the year 2017 for the first time in four years to profit growth .

Other districts have to make their contribution .

Peter Moody claims that stewards were trying to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody claims that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried in the last year a spy in his stables to install and threatened to quit the race .
He took aim at the stewards and the Health Department of Racing Victoria , claiming that scratching of Lady Tatai for Raceday treatment , the last straw on Wednesday , carrying out a personal campaign against him with the late .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself have found even under difficult conditions , when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at lid ARIS , he can not explain .
He had held back 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want that it `` look like too high hanging grapes . ''
`` I planned to say anything about it , and I sat long on it , but sometimes they are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , '' Moody said .
You know that it went on .
Sometimes , reaction and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will now go home evening and sleep well .
I would like to go around heads , and I want my owners to think that I will try my best for them .
When you start to think , I do not , I should be no more trainers .
I must then consider what I do with my license .
Before Moody had let go off the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Health Department had tried to spy on his stall .
`` Eighteen months ago , sat in a room with a man - whom I 'll call when asked - Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I do in my stables , '' Moody said at Racing.com .
Apparently , you believe that I am a cheater .
If that 's the case , they should consider themselves certainly on their noses , because they have failed while trying to be brief .
Robert Roulston , former Chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of RVL , were aware of this at the time and still are today .
Should that bring me to the view that it 's personal ?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and responsible people may make outside of coaches , what 's going on in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
I am so bad for the industry ?
Maybe people out there think that I am .
Maybe you must take me my license to offend me , and I have no doubt that what I 'm saying now think they can be .
But I am now arrived at the point where it does n't matter for me , and that makes me sad .
That makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The frustration levels of trainers have built up with the long-running investigation of cobalt at Lidari , and the late scratching led that he said that he `` could throw his license over the table . ''
Moody , best known by his preparation of the undefeated master Black Caviar , described the competition treatment rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse 's legs , which violated the rules .
`` It is against the rules of racing .
I must take full responsibility for it '' , he said .
`` One of my employees has applied erroneously mud on the leg .
It could have been last night so .
It could have been all day yesterday so what was the case .
It was so on race day .
Moody could be an investigation into this matter with a three-month disqualification for the treatment facing Pack on race day be . was opened .
It 's a joke .
People who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse .
`` We all understand that we need rules , but here it has gone too far , '' Moody said .

At their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve spend strategists two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table sitting to decide whether it 's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
Looming above them at one end of the ornate , two-story meeting room a mural of the United States is .
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress : maximizing the US employment and prices here hold .
But since the great recession the Fed acknowledged leaders that there was an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow , it to predict . it is announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short-term interest rate since late 2008 .
Although most of the data show the economy that she grow steadily , could the recent turmoil in the global financial markets make the already cautious fed representatives anxious to reinforce this volatility by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point .
`` Obviously the labour market and inflation primarily will be , the most important thing what they observe '' , said Lindsey M. Piegza , Chief Economist at the broker firm Stifel Nicolaus & co .
`` But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , '' she said .
There is no consensus on what the Fed intends to do , what unsettles to itself the financial market .
About half of the economists who were surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate hike this week .
However , the financial markets expect a wait for the fed , with a key indicator that displays only a 30 % chance to increase .
This indicates a decline in the stock market , if the Fed raises the rate , unless the strategists to soften the blow , they pledge that a further increase is far .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial jumped average by 228,89 points or 1.4 % to 16.599,85 .
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed 's policy maintains the set this week , said John Lonski , Chief Economist at Moody 's capital markets research group .
`` It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at this time '' , he said .
If she does , `` she would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets so that they are not panicking . ''
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would reassure the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
The Fed is on track to increase , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month seemed to be a month ago .
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expect an increase in the rate this year despite the complaints of Liberals , that more economic progress would be required .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % in the last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and in the vicinity of the level , the view the fed as full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And even though inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
The economy `` can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , '' said Ian Shepherdson , Chief Economist at the Pantheon of macroeconomics .
But the financial markets around the world flashed together late last month , after China had devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in the may by more than 16 % below its all-time high , as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow down global growth .
The market has recovered somewhat this month , with the Dow now is up by almost 10 % below the high of May .
For the representatives of the fed , the market turbulence affect the complex calculation when you should raise interest rates .
`` If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last not occurred few weeks , they would attract the reins at this meeting '' , said Stephen D. though , senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for real estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve .
Now , he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better handle the effects .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , '' said though .
None of the Fed 's main concerns is the health of the global economy , therefore she should not involve technically in their decision making .
But in the end the Fed monetary authority of the world has become .
The influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .
The mere reference to the former leader Ben S. Bernanke triggered in 2013 , that the Fed `` could narrow its monetary expansion '' , confusion around the globe .
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , can be that they monitor not only the developments elsewhere , but consult with other central banks and experts , to provide a better understanding of the global economy expected by the Fed 's representative .
Their decision making is `` more art than science , '' said Zachary Karabell , head of global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA. , noticed this month that `` the Fed has a history of overreaction to financial market movements with not seem associated with the economic fundamentals . ''
Lacker , a voting member of the Federal open market Committee , de cited decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example set for an interest rate hike .
A financial crisis in Asia led to the fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions `` despite limited visible impact on growth in the United States '' , said Lacker .
A year later the Fed representatives made these cuts back .
The Fed should aspects of financial stability during a major crisis such as the collapse of the market 2008 first put , said Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee for determining the interest rate the Bank of England .
The recent turmoil will not come close to this level , he said .
`` She will not be certainly the situation , in which she is afraid of an increase in interest , because the markets worry '' , said Posen , President of the Peterson Institute for international economics .
The Federal always contains Reserve Act still this double mandate and mentioned the financial stability , and until that changes , I do n't think that she should be ahead of time .

Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of great fashion show and a waxworks horror : the designer Jean Paul Gaultier ( 63 ) on Wednesday in Munich an exhibition of his work presented .
The highlights : mannequins , which look frighteningly human thanks to video projections .
You wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which among other things , with Madonna 's stage outfits to the big star who became fashion scene – and that he put men in skirts .
`` I can no longer say that I 'm terrible of Haute Couture the enfant because I have white hair . ''
`` It used to be bleached , it 's real , '' said Gaultier .
For the visitors of the exhibition `` From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk '' ( from the sidewalk to the catwalk ) , which is from the 18th September at the Kunsthalle of the hypo Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed its initial opposition to a show about his person .
He was actually against it , because : `` For me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , '' he said .
If you die , you get into the Museum .
The impressive collection had made previously in Montreal , Canada and Paris station .
`` It 's so much more than just nice clothes , '' said the Director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Diederen .
It is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhibits give an insight in the work of the man of who has made fashion history , without ever having completed training to overlooking .
Chronologically , the show is not established , but it is a perfectly choreographed piece of art for much effort : to style the dolls , a stylist was hired for specially .
According to the curator Loriot of maxim of Thierry , 14 tons of material have carted the makers to Munich .
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with corset .
Heidi meets Madonna .
He interested himself for strong women ( `` women are smarter than men '' ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaultier said .
Horse animal 's old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
It stands for the first , tentative fashionable steps of the designer .
As a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) he attracted bras and dresses his teddy , Gaultier said .
His parents were not allowed to play with a doll .
He taught later even the design of fashion itself .
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gaultier in Munich .
Later I bought the but of course .
For his first own fashion show , he did not pay the models .
They got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .

Angela Merkel and refugee policy : `` we do it ''
The influx of refugees is an enormous challenge – the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
What to expect in Germany ?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will be according to projections of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) is Germany able to absorb one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination given the unusual challenge : `` I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it '' .
The following overview provides what to expect Germany .
Apartments are needed according to different forecasts between 350000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of construction ) and 400000 ( estimate of Pestel Institute ) per year - and the next five years .
That 's almost twice as much , built as before ( 250000 apartments ) .
The lack of housing in affordable rental properties is dramatic : every year 60000 to 80000 social housing from the rent controls fall out , and these discounted apartments will apply for refugees .
Therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
Is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute : 80 000 social housing units per year would have to emerge and that the Federal Government would have to invest funding amounting to 6.4 billion a year .
Scientists and federal Bauministerin agree , that there should be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
According to the Institute for labour market and occupational research , it is assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be gainfully employed in the long term .
However , the refugees would not systematically criticized asked in Germany after their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation .
For the integration of refugees is vital if they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the host society , but also for the self-esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt .
In Germany , there has been a change in policy according to Thränhardt : from the work ban for refugees to the recognition of work .
While there was a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years , this was limited , in November 2014 to three months as well as the residence requirement , asylum seekers on a place of residence .
The view has prevailed in society - also due to the lack of skilled workers - the majority , that faster access to the labour market should enable refugees .
Lack knowledge of German is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
So far , there is no sufficient offer of General and professional language courses .
Research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts .
Networking is the best way to work integration according to Thränhardt .
The Berlin school administration has determined that only a few refugees parents give their children in the day-care centres , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : `` For the rootless parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , '' says Ilja Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the daycare center , the Administration distributed handouts in different languages .
Should the need for teachers by the large number of refugees to rise , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about , by allowing more technical schools .
In the countries , students without knowledge of German in welcome classes are prepared for teaching .
You are taught but not always by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also of teachers , who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
Them there is no lack of , says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration .
The German Student Association estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
In principle , no State prohibits the study of asylum seekers or tolerated - Berlin was the only exception so far , Interior Senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) but gave up his stance .
Access to the University could be facilitated study willing refugees .
For refugees with a residence permit or condoning get no benefits according to the laws , when they start studying .
The latter have basically no student loans , as they fall outside the circle of bafögberechtigten persons .
Tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany in order to be eligible for student loans , so far four years from January 1 , 2016 shortened to this margin to 15 months .
This funding gap must be closed but , call noise , Berlin 's State Secretary for science , and the German Studentenwerk Steffen .
Students should immediately get student loans .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
The State should gradually the same rights give Islam as they have the churches , and further develop the existing State Church law to a new state religions ratio .
The establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association , who take professional care of the newcomers would be important .
The rights include responsibilities .
Must agree the representatives of Islam on a clear point of contact and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to give him some control .
This includes the willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism .
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Aiman Mazyek , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflict could be brought to Germany .
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany `` have forfeited immediately their right to stay , here in Germany , '' he said in the Bayerischer Rundfunk .
He proposed to translate the basic law in Arabic .
Integration will in the future much more than today to be a theme of the society as a whole .
This is also the majority society must change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Although Germany has - as a result of European decisions – for a decade on a tight a federal agency and a general equality law .
But as the NSU murders showed in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive learns very slowly .
Equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the non-white German interest groups long demand and why international agreements such as the Convention against racism oblige Germany , must become a reality in the next few years , when the country remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their facilities for the benefit of all .
In General , Germany is able to provide the previously expected refugees , medical doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery said .
`` We create with regard to man power and capacity , '' , he told the Tagesspiegel .
However , additional money into the system must flow for it .
To avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery calls immediately upon registration health cards to hand over all comers .
Services could be charged later with the Federal States .
And in the long term , it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited range of services , which provides the laws .
Otherwise , above all the language barriers to make the doctors .
Already , so the Berlin health scientist has demonstrated Thea Borde , migrants are worse about their illnesses enlightened than other patients .
Not only in hospitals , including medical practices interpreter costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
Many refugees already with more general focal points in the emergency care would help .
And with another diagnostic view .
There 's significantly more untreated disability among refugee children about , and young people is about HIV education .
German doctors from their training would be clear but with different syndromes , says Montgomery .
`` Parasites or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect '' . and with regard to the shortage of doctors , whether the refugees even relief in sight .
The Syrians have a highly developed education system , many refugees are even doctors .
In order to be able to practice , they would have to prove their qualification however , and may again take examinations .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill according to the Federal Chamber of psychotherapist ( BPtK ) : most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Munz , President of the BPtK explains refugee children , are particularly vulnerable .
A recent study at the TU Munich proves that five Syrian refugee children traumatized is on in Germany .
Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , among other things , suffers from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath , dizziness , heart palpitations , and fear of death .
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , severe irritability and emotional numbness .
Early treatment is necessary , to prevent that the symptoms were chronic , Munz said .
So far , only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy .
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services may submit a request for psychotherapy , but does it take for several months to the process .
Also mostly officers or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness , would decide in the social services , whether or not treatment is necessary .
This would often lead to misjudgments , says Munz .

Officials of Aich/DOB because of infidelity in court
At the regional court of Klagenfurt two officials of the Austrian volleyball Vice master Aich/DOB due to breach of trust and tax evasion have must answer on Wednesday .
The defendants confessed not guilty .
One of them had been indicted for abuse of authority .
From this accusation , he has been finally acquitted in May .
The current process was postponed .
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel had emerged in the preliminary investigation , that the defendants used funds from the Club 's accounts , which they were able to manage in their functions , in the years 2006 and 2011 for private purposes .
He estimated the damage at around 400,000 euros .
The sports officials are also accused of financial crimes .
This fact was the Chairman of the Senate of the jury , judge Michaela Sanin .
It is to be negotiated at a later date .
To the wastage of infidelity , the Defense pointed out that a financial loss caused the Association at any time .
The sports officials had charged only allowances and out the sports club had for whom she worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which she invested time and money , out of debt - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600,000 shillings ( about 44,000 euros ) in 2001 .
`` At that time we were faced with the situation : we continue the club or we close down ? `` , told one of the defendants , in the lack of large tax accountant .
With his colleague and co-defendant he then decided to take on this task .
With all the risks .
`` We have shot for money , made our life insurance as collateral at the Bank , '' he said at the hearing .
Had been agreed with the Association : you can freely manage the money , just no debt may be made .
Furthermore be - with appropriate financial - success the payment of allowances retroactive to 1991 decided been .
Therefore you have a portion of the expenses until years later , namely from the year 2003 , as a plus on the account had been paid out .
Therefore , also package and not detail charges seemed , explained the former Chairman of the operations .
The accounts and passbooks managed the two defendants together , said the second accused .
Why the payouts not in detail had been published in the Association , asked the judge .
The Club have not been interested in the detail for financial management , only the pursuit was important , so the answer .
When in 2011 against a the official investigation for abuse of Office , an amount was transferred from 120,000 euros to the account .
Reserves were , the defendants said .
This trading account in the name of the second accused , and was not aware of the association according to the statement .
`` Why ? '' asked the judge .
That the respondent knew long no answer .
Then , finally , he said he believed that this was the best for the Club .
If something had happened to him , no one would have known some of that money was the Prosecutor in the room .
The co-accused had been informed , the official explained himself .
This transfer was formulated as '' damage '' .
Why make good damage ? , judge and public prosecutor wanted to know .
On the first defendant said that he had been not agree with this wording , because never was a damage to the Club .
But what should I do if the lawyer says : `` With all of you are off the hook '' .
`` I am a legal representative ? '' he asked .
Furthermore , the official said he had never a penny content based , charged he had only mileage and diets .
On diets he set the Association 1,000 euros per month , the actual cost was much higher , he added .
The defendants could not have accurate records for the early years .
They had no longer been kept after an audit in which everything correct had been assessed , they said .
Also the second defendant had obtained a mileage allowance .
All fixes have been made in cash , that he have to drive from his home in international market for the Bank to Bleiburg , he said in his statement .
The hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses .

Eight golden rules for living in student residences
Eleven years ago , I moved as a young 19 year old in a dorm room , still in the belief in berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the tense smile of that I have - annoyed and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned , can be distilled into eight simple rules .
The move into student housing ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening .
It 's tempting to talk : tell people where you 're from , if and where you took sabbatical , where you stand in terms of CORBYN and why `` neither love nor hate , because seriously , guys , it 's only a yeast extract HAHAHA , I 'm in my room Marmite honestly you . ''
Breath .
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those that you would not speak , even if your lashes were on fire and that fire extinguishers would be .
Let people .
The rooms of people transform venues and communal gathering places often in drinks receptions , movie night , but they are also the places where people get dressed and put her underwear .
This involved : not remember to start at the University with a relationship
Introverts get rough treatment at the University .
Your room should be a refuge , but many student residences form a room to room shopping culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship .
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
Nothing in the culture allows you to say : `` I like you , and I want that our friendship will continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . ''
Try to feel when a fellow student of socializing is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of knocking .
Speaking of knocking : do it .
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a non-locked door was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Friendship close by baking .
As you begin the University at the peak of the back-mania , the knock on the doors of people is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s to present with a plate of Brownies , `` welcome in the neighborhood , I have you baked something . so , and please smile when I ask you some personal questions . ''
To offer homemade treats is a great way to make friends .
Her roommate feel obliged to entertain and will associate your face with a tasty morsel at the end of May .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent Baker .
Poorly mixed lumps of flour , sugar and fat cause that people be sleeping when you knock on the door .
There is a common crime in student dormitories to steal food .
Of course , the claws of chicken is a theft , but it is also taking a drop of Milchs for tea ?
Check with the owner of the milk .
The chances are good that they say to use , even if they cook inside .
If someone steals your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try so balanced to deal as my roommate , who added a detergent to their milk to punish thieves .
She is now in prison .
You should make no noise , which prevents people from sleep or work .
It is not simply to be a decent person , but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb to the people , in the glass house sitting .
A girl in my Hall asked their neighbors , whether it matters you , drum & bass to put something down because it three o'clock in the morning , and she had in the morning a test .
You have responded with even louder music .
When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock , she let her neighbors kindly two hours sleep before she all had their own music , completed her door and went to their three-hour exam .
Would it not romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same dorm ?
Conversely , it would be not profoundly embarrassing if you keep a roommate for your future spouse , to make them turn back and see every day have to and perhaps see how she pulls across all mutual friends to ?

He demanded that the interests of humanity before the interests of individual Nations or even continents should be placed under the circumstances .
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis , although admirable , but was not appropriate to the situation .
`` It is impossible that everyone in Europe can come , '' he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama of in Germany and Austria praised efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .

Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis rather deserves praise as criticism for his behavior .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise as criticism according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy , rather for his own behavior .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo , the as `` special KS '' is referred to , Montreal was the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the masters in the spotlight .
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon thereafter Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee and Harrison cried out : `` Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios , and I should hit the child . ''
While he was last seen as he smashed a racket after a spasm of thwarted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Groth for second place in individual Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against the United Kingdom .
`` One thing about which I quite ereifere , is the fact that I believe Thanasi a little in the dispute was involved , '' Healy said .
He broke a racket when he lost because of a spasm in the U.S. open , but he is not the first player who broke a racket out of frustration with himself , and I know well enough to know that he is not proud Thanasi .
But , really , he has behaved extremely well in the US open , even in the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think that he deserves a lot of credit .
He has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think that he has been treated a little too severe .
He is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in the locker room area , he trained hard , he is in good shape , it is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits .
Healy supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios , which starts on Friday , for the important preliminaries and he describes the `` joint decision '' as a right for all , but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term integral part of the team . ''
`` First we want that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around it [ Kyrgios ] , '' Healy said .
And I believe that Nick has risen very quickly , what people like Federer and Murray to have . it goes in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we are trying to support him , we try , some time out of the limelight , in which he only can think , I appropriate , consider him the consequences of his actions to make . and it is best for the team and it 's the best for him .

The Brexit camp ( Brexit = exit Britain from the EU ) could win at inlet if the economy up to the year 2017 in a lull
David Camerons half-baked renegotiation strategy , to keep Britain in the EU , is with each passing day more deeply get into trouble , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy `` it is Yes or no ? '' CORBYN , Director of labour or the TUC , which itself fell sharply because of Europe on Tuesday .
Foreigners have also their Corbyns and Nigel Farages .
A European diplomat friend said recently that some Member States , so deeply involved in various crises such as the EU is it and not getting out of their own debt , Britain 's own agenda with split concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty , which most of the time they do not want are fed up .
In Brighton , the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also does n't like this , if they endanger the social protection .
We could call it Dave and Georges Selfies agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of finance climb to the Summit and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
It 's always about me .
My European friend , the one for outside lighting UK inside the EU tent wishes - `` Let us not only with France '' , says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted Ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point , where it is they do n't care whether we stay or go .
Germany cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but it has been 10 years in power and wants to leave the Office before it looks bad for them as it happened with the excessively long waiting out like Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and cabbage ( 16 ) .
France 's François hollande looks at his re-election or its replacement in the year 2017 .
He is also a fading force .
Poland has a left a nationalist right-wing Government , Spain may soon .
It is difficult to imagine that they will bend over backwards to , to help the Selfies British , whose Energie should be used better for Scotland 's exit from the UK to prevent - something they also do not want , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
Therefore some such Ministers even deliberately unhelpful comments in the SNP style might plan during Britain 's referendum campaign 2017 , in order to speed up the Brexit process , my friend suspects .
`` The renegotiation was a bust , '' and `` Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation . ''
The Europeans know how predatory , the fleet can be street at their expense and the oligarchy of the press barons is what EU skeptics , as they in 1975 but were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1 .
You can contact weak Boris Johnson , remember ore euro opportunists , who has made a name as an `` EU straight bananas '' Brussels correspondent in the early 90 's .
In all of his craziness , Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies .
This includes the medley of tax have villains , phone hacking aliens and the pseudo belonged to non-residents , who own most of our major newspapers .
Actually , Tony Blair thought much about it , but found that if you sit down with a hot gorilla in a cage , you spread better bananas to distract him , rather than for his lunch and dinner .
In fact , Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron 's referendum back , because Blair had been the principle of the Constitution not adopted the EU , which then was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door for him .
The press has never forgiven that .
But the Nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave a friendly Pat on the back to me on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he needed no time to waste for me anymore - seems in danger of Neil Kinnocks boycott Murdoch strategy of 80 years to repeat a mistake then and now .
It may take , but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to attract the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , the BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyns official position to Europe – I say time friendly - in development .
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU .
Well , outside of Ukips traditional blue dye tendency and the Wilder realms of Tory small Engländerismus everyone can say most people Yes .
It is what this week said Hilary `` A Benn , but not a Bennite '' Benn on the radio and on television as the Scouts in it struggled not to admit that Corbyns appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 70s , when his father tried on television about to be disloyal to his labour Cabinet colleagues not to go too far and lose his Cabinet job .
Hilarys fight was even more attractive .
To fight , but to stay `` in all circumstances '' - Benns expression - was not what said McDonnell , still what JC told his comrades and members by all accounts at its closed-door meeting on Monday night .
You are thinking what will - give always the sentimental image of bottom-up from CORBYN that he has stirred even me - news discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock important and above all in the vortex of social media , a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right to give Cameron no free pass for Europe , which allows him to keep Labour 's support in the referendum campaign , as McDonnell said it goes without saying .
Simon Jenkins thinks certainly so .
But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguities to EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy , its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents for the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes .
As Tom Watson is rock solid with its ambiguities to NATO - convinced that JC is launching a campaign to exit the - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors in all at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – they have also suspicious voters – to make concessions to the British when all this may be pointless ?
The United States are already quite disappointed by the poor military performance in the Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost-cutting the Tory Government in power , what I was reminded of something at the start on Monday , what British influence security forum called .

Choice 2016 : Bernie Sanders ahead of Hillary Clinton 's national poll halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders her gains compared to ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary ( 58 percent previously ) , while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is running for President , receives support from 15 percent of democratic voters in the primaries .
More than five months before the start of the primaries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that your opinion is , which candidate they will support .
But Clinton 's supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates in their choice .
Since the CBS News poll , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while Sanders scored some gains .
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates , but these projections have been reduced .
Their support among men has fallen significantly , and Sanders is only with 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has not materialised , and she and Sanders are now at the same level .
Clinton has , however , a big advantage among older voters .
Last month Clinton before Sanders was with double-digit lead the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group .
About half of democratic voters in the primaries across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when she was nominated by the party .
A quarter would support with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate .
Six percent would not support them .
It is perhaps not surprising that Clinton 's current supporters of her excited .
The views are more mixed for those who do not currently support Clinton -- only about a quarter would support enthusiastically .
While 48 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say about their top candidate Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
If Clinton 's supporters in an open question asks why they want that she is the candidate , is followed by the view that it is time that a woman President is ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) .
Of Clinton 's supporters , also their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is mentioned .
Consent to deal with the problems and the eligibility are also cited .
As the Vice President raises a potential for the Presidency in the balance , 57 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it .
When democratic voters in the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , is Biden at the top .
More than half say of Clinton 's supporters that Biden would be their second choice well ahead of Sanders .
Biden , decides not to run for the Democratic nomination Hillary Clinton 's lead over Sanders , of 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race increases .
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election ; however , this figure of 78 percent has decreased in the last month .
Biden is a second in this measurement by far , but the percentage that `` wählbarsten '' sees it as the , has increased .
Nevertheless , at the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about eligibility .
Similar as in the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters to the primaries as unacceptable stands out .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results for some important characteristics among voters of their party primaries .
Majorities consider Clinton , Sanders , and Biden as honest and trustworthy , and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Biden performs in the three candidates the best in honesty , while Clinton 's strength is the lead .
Thirty percent of democratic voters believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic voters in the primary elections see also Clinton , Sanders , and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views .
About a quarter of democratic voters in all of these measurements has no opinion of Sanders .
As questions continue to be made Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal email address and server during the term as Secretary of State , the most democratic voters in the primaries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole .
But it 's a different story in the American public as a whole .
Now , half of Americans is not satisfied with their explanation , while only about one-third is satisfied .
The public opinion was divided in March , shortly after came the problem to light .
Most Americans said that the E-Mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had even deteriorated .
There are mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 , saying that their views of Clinton have become worse .
Although Clinton by the voters of their party is considered honest and trustworthy , as this is still a problem for them among registered voters as a whole : only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points since May .
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time , 55 percent of voters view across the country also Trump as dishonest and not trustworthy .
Clinton and Trump get good marks for leadership .
Of the six tested candidates , Biden , Carson and Bush cut off best with honesty .
A majority view Sanders rather than honest , but as with Carson , many have no opinion of him .
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .

The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place where the residents are called show-offs .
This property combines some with the billionaire , who wants to become President .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is good for excitement .
Whether he expressed xenophobic , male goes to journalists or revealed knowledge gaps in the international policy of the crisis – the candidates for the Office of the US President vigorously stirs up the election campaign .
And good cuts .
That is registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt , where the real estate billionaire grandparents come from .
The New Yorker with the hair dryer hairstyle is a term for many in the wine-producing village on the wine route .
Some on-site 1200 inhabitants is over many corners with it is related .
His grandfather came from Kallstadt , Germany : Donald Trump , here in the campaign mode .
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump .
And what do think the villagers about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I think the find this somehow exciting , are but not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter way '' , says Simone Wendel .
The native Kallstädterin has turned an amusing documentary about the village and its famous offspring , which trump even the ketchup-Heinz family counts .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , comes in `` Kings of Kallstadt '' to speak - so with the statement that he would be surely successful if he lived in Kallstadt ( 2014 ) .
He has not placed it to the King of hearts .
Although there was respect for the achievements of the family , but also tend to be the thought that Trump was `` already a bit of a big mouth '' , says Wendel .
Coincidentally the nickname noisy , the Kallstadt in the vicinity , `` The Brulljesmacher '' - to high German : she says the blowhard .
Trump is from the village of show-offs .
The Trump'sche success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold miners in the United States .
First land purchases in New York were a cornerstone of the real estate company .
But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy : your desire to return permanently to the home , failed due to the Bavarian State , to which the Palatinate then belonged .
He had not included Trump because he was once left without permission , said the Director of the Institute of Palatinate history and folklore , Roland Paul , to the film 's release .
Trump was the grandson of `` illegal immigrant '' .
This is in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of the descendants .
He had repeatedly disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
`` So as the rumbles , it is not so nice , '' says Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant relative of trumps ( `` grandma was a born Trump , Grandpa was born Heinz '' ) .
The winemaker in retirement sees rather distant from the Americans , `` he is always so short-tempered '' .
Does he believe that Trump come ?
`` I can not imagine that '' , says the 72 .
`` He never cared about Kallstadt '' .
The boarding house landlady Veronika Schramm as some Kallstadter mentioned that a descendant of the family Heinz when visiting donated something for the church organ , which was generally well received .
`` I can not imagine that of the Donald '' says the 68 .
It would be better if he could not win the election , because `` has such radical views , I do n't know if that 's good '' .
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States , would have been so like him , `` he would have never reached '' .
`` There are more interesting subjects than him , '' says Winemaker 's daughter Sarah Bühler .
And as President ?
`` My President is not Yes '' she says .
And : `` The grapes are ripe without the Trump of President of '' .
12 000 filmgoers have seen Wendel movie for the Trump was interviewed long , also in the United States , the interest awakened .

Angel Di Maria and Edinson CAVANI held course , as Paris Saint-Germain its Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö in the Parc des Princes Stadium started on Tuesday .
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champions on the way , but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when CAVANI scored a header in the 61st minute .
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A , Paris needs as they strive not only qualifying for the knockout rounds , a strong start against the Swedish master , but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances before the goal he was later in the game against his hometown team and the Club , with whom he already began his illustrious career in 1999 , replaced .
`` It 's not easy , at home or abroad in the Champions League to win . so it is a good start to win 2-0 , to cause problems for our opponents and relaxed look back , even though there are certain things that we still need to perfect in the course of the season , '' Blanc said .
`` That 's a good sign .
`` We wanted to win and we have won , although I regret that we do not have scored one or two more goals . ''
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team held a 2-2 draw on its own course against Bordeaux in the first division at the weekend , but he was cut out by di Maria in the fourth minute .

But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , Trapps post passed to Kevin in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead PSG was on himself sometimes , with some wayward and bad accounts , not least by Ibrahimovic which Championship no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after CAVANI had used it after the restart .
Nevertheless he proved much more skill , when he brought his team-mates into the game , and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic , the Di Maria is transformed into a ball , which past directed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second goal was finally shortly after the hour mark thanks to CAVANI . the Uruguayans scored his sixth goal of the season so , after Ibrahimovic had fished on a left flank of Maxwell .
That ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game , and only excellent intervention of Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz , could keep the end result , before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was stripped of a gate at the end .
The coach of Malmö , age Hareide , later admitted that PSG played a class above his team , and the Norwegians said : `` our last Champions League was game in December last year .
Since then , we have played only in the Swedish League , which has the same level of .
The qualifiers are not sufficient '' .

FriendsFest : the comedy show which gives us serious lessons about male
The absence of similar appearances in shows is obvious , especially in noting how the need for men to open up , has become now more desperate than ever , how to prove suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high .
In 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common in men than in women .
In an effort to tackle the problem , the campaign against living miserably ( CALM - campaign against a pitiful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim to put culture in question prevents the men to seek help when they need it .
Friendship is the heart in the fight to address this challenge .
A recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with `` healthy mood '' , his chances of recovery doubled .
For those who are not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends cut in half the risk of mental health problems .
But of course you must first of all have friends make a friendship work .
In the age of communication through social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , cheerful and successful , although in reality dominated the isolation .
This superficial success is dominated by the , what psychologists call extrinsic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which has a much deeper effect on our mental health .
And a video game inventor and billionaire recently said that money ca n't buy really good luck .
The nice thing about friends was that this focus on the head was placed .
Each character is defined by his work , but because of his personality , which shone through the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey and Chandler 's frequent hugs , moments of football watching in comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men may relate to in any case , to explore their feelings even if they often hold back completely .
As an employee of the telephone emergency service explained it to me : ... `` my listener role for people who feel depressed and suicidal , really clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
The old saying `` I get along this '' has a tremendous effect , such as the fact that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . ''
Friends is one of the shows of that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms .
It clearly presents the small moments of male .
So my objective outsider status over the phone also may help people in moments of despair , the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so , when you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest with the scenery completely redesigned to celebrate this weekend , then why take your friends for a drink in the Central Perk .
Or , even better , if you see sitting around someone alone in Starbucks , give him a smile and say hello .
You never know what difference could make your friendship .
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest

`` Since no one can say in principle , that does n't concern me , I have nothing to do . ''
`` This should interest every one to get this issue '' , said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach .
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin he intends to discuss intensively the refugee situation in Germany .
`` I 'm next Wednesday in the Chancellor 's Office and meet the Minister Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor there . ''
`` Since the theme will play certainly a central role '' , he announced .
Football could and would help .
But , the policy must set the decisive course .
The German Football Federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative `` 1:0 for a welcome '' by four years .
Niersbach said `` About the Egidius Braun Foundation , we have made sure that this program will continue until 2019 '' , on the verge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian 's / Malta .
Some Bundesliga support this program .
Already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs send a clear signal if they `` Help - # refugeeswelcome '' will carry the imprint on the left sleeve of the Jersey instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Hermes ) .
`` We want to make it also clear that everyone should help where and how they can '' , said Leverkusen Sports Director Rudi Völler ( Tuesday ) the `` Bild '' newspaper , and described the project as a `` Matter of course '' .
`` The refugee drama concerns everyone , no one can look away . ''
`` We can Bundesliga , no , we have to our power , our influence and our opportunities use to help the many refugees who have suffered already so incredibly , '' , said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz .
Hoffenheim General Manager Peter Rettig spoke of a `` prominent sign in the League '' .
To the European Championship qualifier against Hungary on Friday , the national team of Women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale .
Niersbach called the support of refugees as `` a great community work German football '' .
That all 36 licensed clubs in their places had started their own projects , was great .
Just as great is that small and very small clubs are active there .
The message `` 1:0 for a welcome '' , which we have spent is lived in football .
`` This is of enormous importance , '' he said .
In this and the next year , the Association together with the DFB-selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 EUR for the integration of refugees .
`` The clubs have obtained already the whole sum for 2015 '' , said Niersbach .

For slightly overweight diabetics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years according to a new study .
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data need a long time to show something , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert of weight loss surgery , wrote of an editorial to the new study in JAMA surgery .
Weight loss surgery or weight loss surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
Over the years , obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 is considered to be obese .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , the researchers from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng used general hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare these two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were overweight .
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
Meanwhile , the BMI for those receiving non-surgical treatments of diabetes about the same at 29 remained .
Among those undergoing a surgical procedure , the diabetes disease broke up completely and 28 % partly at 36 % .
In the medical treatment group diabetes fully only at one percent , and with only about two percent was in comparison .
In addition , the results in the control of blood pressure , triglycerides and `` bad '' LDL cholesterol were `` Generally better in the 'surgical ' group '' , found the authors .
The researchers monitored also the patients blood levels of hemoglobin A1c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c the best below 7 percent is held , write the researchers .
After the operation , the average hemoglobin A1c decreased level of around 9 per cent to about 6 per cent .
In the medical therapy group , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
But this better `` glycemic control '' – as the improved hemoglobin A1c level is reflected in you - not the mortality was reduced in five years , according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team compared the average results for the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , the bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrectomy Group had lost more weight ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , reached larger declines in the BMI ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) , and rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.9 % vs. 16.7 % ) .
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden , that operation leads to a longer life , says Blackstone from the University of Arizona , College of medicine Phoenix .
In the Swedish study , it was in obese people who underwent obesity surgery likely to die about 29 percent - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods in the course of 15 years .
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival in surgery patients , said Blackstone , it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process .
`` This is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , '' without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin seriously to take weight , as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30 .
`` I think that we can wait too long until we encourage people to take this seriously , '' she said .
`` I think that as soon as they have accumulated genetic changes , which have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really hard . ''

Why I will be witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will to see how a man is put to death .
When it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spectator Gallery in the death Chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary , when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection .
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
The invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day neared , I began to fear me .
So , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States , and as more applications than places available , a macabre Lottery takes place to decide who will be elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
Who is selected , which will monitor it emotionless .
I ca n't do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glossips close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship in the months with phone calls and a visit to two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
We laugh often much when we talk .
The prison authorities say that I may be not a witness and a journalist , so it will be me not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen , to record what I see .
I must just try to remember all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter , to give up my impartiality .
Here is the lesson .
Tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she `` would have to put better it '' , but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I 'm doing .
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I 've said and written .
He does n't tell me what I have to write , and I would n't do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can at any time remove me from his list of witnesses .
But he wants that an international reporter is present there to write .
When he dies , he thinks that the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim portraits ware , a reporter for the Huffington Post , is sitting next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , you hear the series of podcasts that I made .
I will not turn on all the details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions would make him guilty for the murder of Barry Van Treese to be a beneficiary of the Act .
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is guilty not of murder .
I sure think that there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from that perspective , I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really objective .
There will be other reporters , which you can use for this .
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .

FC arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must be ahead of the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger compared Wilshere to stressed that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England , and given its history , its participation is still uncertain in the next summer at the European Championships .
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere after a separate ankle injury had finished last season strongly , and then back to his old swing had returned during the previous season .
`` This kind of injury threatened not the career , '' Wenger said .
It is a bone that is not well healed .
This is not a major issue .
This was just an accident .
It was in conjunction with his ankles or the injuries that he had before .
That may be true from a purely medical standpoint , but as Wenger also recognized , there are the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
It developed also an unpleasant pattern .
The study of Premier injuries Ltd has 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago .
He played in only 65 of Arsenal 's 157 League games in the last five seasons .
The broader picture for arsenal is that they Premier were League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 of one of the two , which have recorded the most days of the injury .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury will continue during the last season .
`` Sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time in which you strengthen your body and have to win power '' , said Wenger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body is stabilized , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career out of the way he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and Wenger is a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start .
Wenger can begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
`` I try to keep the balance and to treat those who need it , a small breather , '' Wenger said .
Although arsenal are favourites to progress from Group F , the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe .
Dynamo is undefeated after 41 games , after the `` Invincible '' campaign was launched in the last season .
On Tuesday night , the stadium was hit by an earthquake , which measured 3.2 on the Richter scale .
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year .
Wenger believes that arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope to lead the Club to its first European Cup triumph with its management .
`` This drive is immense , '' said Wenger .
It has never worked for arsenal .
We were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand , I 'm long enough in business to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .

Experts criticize public health England report on E-cigarettes
Allegations of a State-funded agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with ties to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
Experts who write in the British medical journal ( BMJ ) , joined Lancet by criticizing the of public health England ( PHE ) used evidence in its report on e-cigarettes .
PHE in last month published the `` policy report '' and describes him as a `` comprehensive review of the evidence '' .
However , some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the `` extraordinarily windy basis '' on the PHE founded his main conclusion .
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have wondered whether the claims `` based on stone or sand '' .
Martin McKee , Professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine and Simon Capewell , Professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . ''
They said that the public expects , that the claim of PHE , that `` The current best estimate is that E-cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking '' based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling .
In fact , comes this statement from a single session of 12 people , who were called up to be a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis ( multi criteria decision analysis - MCDA ) to develop , to get their opinions on the harm of nicotine-containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss health , whose Managing Director before should have benefited American tobacco ( BAT ) of British for an independent study .
He signed the references of the BAT to the public health in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that to get funds from an E-cigarette manufacturers but they added not the financing , he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
The reasons for the selection of members of the Board are not included , but include several well-known E cigarettes champions , of which some specify the paper industry funding .
Some other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
Also the tobacco line of PHE took part in the meeting .
The research of group `` admits significantly , '' that there is a lack of `` hard evidence for the damage of most products for most criteria '' , McKee and Capewell wrote .
However , none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report is discussed .
McKee and Capewell said that were the allegations of PHE , that 'there no evidence so far is that E-cigarettes are used as a way to smoking for children or non-smokers ' premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , Director of health and well-being at PHE , said that the allegations of BMJ previously has been responded to .
He said : `` E-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking . ''
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction .
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of E-cigarettes in comparison are low , but that we have continued to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform of the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year .
By the clear presentation of current evidence that E-cigarettes without risk are , but represent only a fraction of the damage of that is caused by smoking , we meet our national competence .

JVA Berlin-Tegel : Five square meter cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has been quite Tegel an ex-inmate of prison , which for months was housed in a small cell .
Due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation in principle if they are housed in small cells .
The Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday has decided .
The people concerned can the judges according to even money hope , if they were only a few days in the narrow spaces ( file No . : 1 BvR 1127/14 ) .
Thus , an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in the prison of Berlin-Tegel Airport between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was not spatially separated .
Then , the man who is now back at large according to his lawyer had been moved to a larger cell .
Although his official liability proceedings of the degrading conditions of detention against the State of Berlin failed .
However , the Constitutional Court reversed the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination there .
You can see the human dignity of the man injured .
Supreme Court decides on the amount of compensation
Detention days for compensation are decisive of the period in question for legal reasons only a few days , a claim for compensation is given , it said .
Otherwise , it would be `` a decline of legal protection of personality to fear '' .

The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
So they spoke to only damages a prisoner in April because he was naked in a cell .
Also the multiple occupancy of a cell without toilet is a decision of 2011 according to unworthy of man .
Karlsruhe , also confirmed the Berlin court , which had certified an inhumane accommodation in November 2009 an inmate in a Parallelfall in addition , on Wednesday .

Melbourne storm Coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals because of allegations to wrestling
Melbourne storm Coach Craig Bellamy has referred to as `` Agenda-Setting '' criticism of the tackling of Player favorites of the NRL by two Premier League .
Sydney roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have allowed `` Wrestling '' the storm players with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly-veiled remark to the storm team , his team reached the final victory against the North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night had . He called the game a `` perfect example '' of Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not `` too good '' in wrestling .
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were focused only on their `` contact us '' at the tackling .
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team confident voice him because it meant that they were worried to be beaten by the storm team .
On Wednesday , `` that appears again and again - I have n't heard that Trent spoke Robinson about wrestling matches when they beat us 2-24 , '' said Bellamy .
I can guarantee that we changed have . but nothing on our defensive system or the techniques in the whole year in the last six weeks , we have made our contact in tackles a real priority , and which has yielded the turnaround for us .
Trent has been there three years , and he obviously has a great team to train he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so was it a bit of a shock to him .
It 's funny how this keeps popping up at this time of year .
Bellamy has attacked Bennett 's idea of the `` exciting football '' and his mentor recalled that Bennett 's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with `` boring '' football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
`` He has his game on Friday night compared with our on Saturday night and their game was exciting '' , Bellamy said .
I remember that in the year 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take a shit about .
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
That 's the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all of his kind of football to play - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like this .
I build confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
Six weeks ago they have not thought to us when it comes to the big games .
Bellamy also noted that the game storm against the roosters scored a higher score than the Broncos game against Cowboys .
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is an exciting game ?
Or breaks make and no points something exciting ?
The game plans are for me .
If you mention us , it means that we will meet in a period still on it .
The storm team has free this weekend , as they have won the right , either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla sharks next Saturday night in the preliminary final at AAMI Park to receive the ticket sales starts from next Tuesday morning .

That Viktor Orbán sends more thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
Instead of in the camp Röszke immediately in the construction of structures to help , ensuring humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the atmosphere of national socialism .
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing in the border areas with chaotic conditions .
Also the refugees will have to determine that the `` promised land '' , which has been invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp .
It will be a major challenge , given the continuing flows of refugees and the onset of winter , to produce decent conditions for asylum seekers in us .
And it is an even bigger – peace , to maintain security and stability in Austria .

Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven .
While this cry brought the left fullback and will close it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Gaal hope does n't give up that Shaw can play again this season .
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute , after the 20-year-old Shaw in the PSV area was broken up .
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
Van Gaal said : `` He has a double fracture of the leg and is in the hospital . ''
He will tomorrow or maybe a day later and then surgery in Manchester .
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic plays , and then this happens .
In the locker room , he had an oxygen mask .
He was crying .
I 'm not a doctor , but if you have a double fracture , then that lasts for six months , and he will not play in the group stage .
I hope that he can play again this season .
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee has not punished the Mexicans .
Van Gaal thought that the Italian referee had made a mistake .
You can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty kick and a red card were due .
It was a very bad attack with both legs .
A Tweet to Shaw 's account was : `` I thank you for your messages . words can not describe all of you , I 'm as tired , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . ''

If a player with that kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent .
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico against van Gaal Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
`` It is difficult very because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that 's not good , '' said Cocu .
For me , it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so that it looked as if he [ Moreno ] touched him had , but I could see not the attack on Luke .
In conversation with SBS6 , Moreno said : `` I know , how it feels , I know how hard that can be .
I feel very bad about . so sorry .

In an emergency call , Professor confesses to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call , Professor Shannon Lamb told with a slightly shaky voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb , it was important to emphasize that his `` cute dog '' but still alive and was probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
Inside the House , officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a hand-written note was scribbled on a white block : `` I 'm so sorry , I wish I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me '' . This was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by lamb .
There was no indication that lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had traveled already 300 miles to the school , where he shot a popular history professor , Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his Office and killed according to the police .
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10:18 .
He said that lamb has made the fateful call sometime after that .
Until the end of the day , there was a further death : lamb took his own life , when the police surrounded him up .
A day after the shooting in the University , forcing students and faculty to hide behind closed doors the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated lamb .
That helped by the investigators at both ends of the State of published details , as well as what students and staff who knew him said , to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
Students said that they looked forward to his lessons .
The police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the `` wonderful people '' with whom he shared his academic life .
Both taught in the Department of social sciences and history , whose teaching staff consists of 17 members , and many students attended classes from both .
At the same time , there are some tendencies to problematic behaviors .
A student , Brandon beavers , who praised lamb , said he seemed a bit excited and nervous , `` as if something is wrong . ''
Another student , Mikel Sykes , said that lamb had told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014-15 with stress .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons , and it said that he had some health problem .
In this year he taught only two online courses .
Recent changes in employment policy of the University meant that the promotion for the Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee of an automatic way to a job as an Assistant Professor .
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course there was something in Mr Lamb 's imagination . ''
These are questions that can no longer answer lamb .
After escaping from the campus , the police of later lambs found track when he won back in Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be arrested lamb killed himself selbstmit a.38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a House about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said Washington County coroner met Hel Johnson .
His car was still in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why lamb to this House went , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb was raised in the area .
Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and education .
He earned his doctorate in education in the spring .
One of the longtime friends of lambs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who some years tried to teach her how to play the guitar .
He was at that time the heart-throb .
All the girls melted away , when he was '' , said Hairston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident .
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time .
In the emergency , lamb said , `` I killed my wife '' , but there was no certificate of marriage .
They had a dog named lightning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a bayou in Gautier .
The police said that was the dog in order .
The ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn o ' Steen , said they were divorced 15 years ago were , but remained friends and had a daughter , which was now 19 years old .
`` She was totally devastated '' , o ' Steen said about his daughter .
She and her mother were best friends .
O ' Steen said he never met lamb , but by his daughter Abigail , he heard that lamb was interested in music and played Blues .
Lamb met Prentiss , he and Abigail were both on a summer fair three years ago .
Later , they played together the occasional gig .
O ' Steen said , his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a bartender and sometimes entertainment Coordinator at the Julep room , a dimly lit bar near the town of Gautier , said that he September 5 for the last time saw lamb and Prentiss night at night , after lamb finished in front of a sparse crowd had finished his guitar and harmonica .
There was no evidence to suggest that there was something wrong .
He said `` just a happy couple '' .
We were cleaning up and joked with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of jokes .
Schmidt , the dead Professor , led the freshman seminar program and specialized in native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three children .
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his fraternity and the Student Committee .
On the campus of Delta State in Cleveland , 900 people , including faculty , staff , students and members of the community in a candlelight commemoration took part on Tuesday night about .
Schmidt 's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also at the vigil took part , while the University Choir `` bright morning star '' and sang `` Amazing Grace '' .
Classes will resume on Wednesday .
`` We try to move our students to return , '' said LaForge .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Authors Emily wagon first of Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans were Associated Press report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that lamb made the distress call , after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb Prentiss although described in his distress call as his wife , but there is no indication that that the two were ever married .

'Sonogenetics ' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematode change the direction at the moment , in which they are irradiated with sound pulses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves .
The tiny nematode change the direction at the moment , in which they have the frequencies too high for the human ear to be heard , are irradiated with pulses of sound .
The pulses work by the switching of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
Further information on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure , called Sonogenetics , can be used with ultrasound to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the guardian that the procedure one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that emits electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat of the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Nematodes do not respond normally to ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did , when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles .
The bubbles , he found out , reinforce the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
The enhanced ultrasound waves effect on structures , the TRP-4 ion channels are called and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with , according to a report in nature communications .
To create ultrasound-controlled nematode , Chalasani changed genetically so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels carry the worms .
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves through the micro bubbles are transmitted more and the worms where they turn on the modified motor neurons .
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics , a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists , neurons with pulses of light on and turn it off .
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
Unlike light that must be revealed to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain can low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through unhindered tissue and can be sent from the top of the skull into the brain .
`` We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments '' , Chalasani said .
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells , he added .

60 employees from twelve Nations offer variety in every way .
`` The animals belong to our family , '' Stephanie 's mother , Brigitte Probst emphasized .
Maladministration in the keeping of circus animals are all too often theme in various animal rights groups .
Stephanie Probst also responds : `` Not feeling well our animals , not fine us '' .
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each caress .
, As they are affectionately called , each request is read whenever possible the `` four-legged artists '' of the eyes .
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
The animal feels uncomfortable , it does not want even in the ring .
So the top priority : make good for the animals .
Especially on your Zebroid , jumbo , a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a zebra Mare , is proud the family Probst .
The two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing has happened .
`` But then , suddenly , our little Jumbo was there , '' said Brigitte Probst .
The Zebroid is still not ready for the circus ring , but it is the unique mascot of the circus Probst .
So something should be for every visitor .
`` One thing is certain , '' says Stephanie Probst : `` Whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and with all my heart '' .

EU Commission proposes new Court in dispute over TTIP
The European Commission proposed a major reform of the current system of arbitration to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP .
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and States should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system corresponding to more traditional dishes in its functioning .
`` We want to establish a system that citizens trust '' , said the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation .
Sweden intends to present the proposal as European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States .
The German Government announced support .
TTIP is to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people .
The plans to reform of the current arbitration specifically provide that the EU and the United States select together independent judges for a new investment Court .
Equally , they should come from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
Also a second instance is provided for the first time .
It would allow it to appeal against judgments .
So far , the parties agreed among themselves on referees , there was not an appeal against their sentences .
In the discussion of the last few months had become clear , that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice , Malmström said .
In the long term , she wants to work out according to an international investment Court .
There , for example disputes between Chinese and EU States then could be sorted out .
The investor-State arbitration required by large corporations ( ISDS ) are considered as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
The traditional arbitration can be as a form of parallel justice criticized about the companies at the expense of taxpayers make compensation , national laws nullify or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards of opponents .
In first opinions , TTIP organizations such as Campact described the EU Commission 's proposals as inadequate .
It was criticized in particular that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( Ceta ) .
German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a major step forward .
The Commission take into account in the reform of key points , which have developed with other EU trade ministers Minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring .
The old system of private arbitration tribunals is off the table .
The French Government also welcomed the plans of Malmström .
The European Business Association BusinessEurope warned to limit the legal remedies available to the economy through too many new rules .
Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged as a result , it was said .
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( transatlantic trade and investment partnership ) can be completed , remained unclear on Wednesday .
The negotiations since mid-2013 .
The subject of investor protection was , however , not discussed so far with the United States .
Originally , a framework for the agreement should be the end of this year .
This date is considered to be no longer tenable .

Who smokes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
Who smokes , is damaging not only the lungs but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study of Potsdam .
The good news : In absence of the risk decreases quickly .
Smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
This is from the long-term study by an international research team out , including several employees of the German Institute for nutritional research ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
Compared to non-smokers , the risk to lose their teeth , the higher 2.5 to 3.6 was in smokers .
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants .
Main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums , emphasizes the DIfE .
For these periodontal disease , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
The relationship between tooth loss and smoking go back to more frequent gingivitis in smokers .
Is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
People who stopped smoking might reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the `` Journal of dental research '' .
However , it could take over a decade , until the danger again sink to the level of non-smokers , first author , said Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
You have to convince people to become non-smokers , said Director Heiner Boeing of the DIfE : `` Smoking shortens the life time . ''
Not to smoke is good for the lungs and blood vessels and leads to our findings to good dental health in old age .
In Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of loss of teeth are affected , the DIfE said .
Previous research had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
The new long-term study say the findings .

Terraced houses for refugees , single parents , low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds houses for people who do n't have much money in the Middle Franconia corners Valley .
So for refugees - but also as a signal : `` Not only refugees need Wohnhraum , but also the single mother and the low-wage earners . ''
`` I 'll show how you can build even today still cheap and good , '' says the 44-year old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are entering the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how fast can create more affordable housing : it builds in a project row houses for refugees .
Mr Gildner , many refugees are entering the housing market .
What solution do you have ?
Markus Gildner : Mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability .
Because people stay here to a large extent .
In view of the refugee flow , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
Very simple , three-story townhouse is the solution .
Gildner : A terraced house takes up the least space .
It facilitates the integration .
This is different , bringing among the people in apartment buildings .
Each of the six houses of that are built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers .
Each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room .
It may be that many refugees will say , it 's peace again , I will go back .
Then , the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs .
What are the costs ?
Gildner : The price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euro , without land .
This is straightforward .
The construction took six months .
This is appropriate .
Have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gildner : Building regulations , I have carried my project correctly .
Always the impending threat of special construction and parking regulation makes it very complicated .
Creepy .
It is still , who creates three apartments in a terraced house , needs at least three pitches .
Only in the cities , the place is missing for this .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How did people react to their row House project ?
Gildner : There , who have accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
What definitely is wrong .
But exacerbate not the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : Is true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built luxury apartments , which hardly any more can afford .
My project has the message , even normal people need housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low-wage earners .
I will show how you can build even today still cheap and good .
That 's what .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied micro-system technology in Regensburg , first with environmental analysis .

No diet fruit - mangoes contain much sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy sweet .
Who wants to pay attention to its slim line but , is not recommended by them often more the .
Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially sucrose .
The exotic fruits are still healthy : stuck in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. above all contain mangoes but plenty of vitamin A and its precursor of beta carotene .
Who eats the fruit , supports thus vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
When buying mangoes should be not too soft or too tight and pleasant smell .
The shell color alone does not indicate , the fruit is as ripe – so green mangoes can taste very delicious .
You should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
Then they taste , of course , pure or in sweet dishes .
A mango gives a special touch but also savory dishes .
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some Salad Greens such as chicory and radicchio .
And a mango chutney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilded ) the Crown of thorns is one of the major works , painted by Otmar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus senior post has written the introduction and updated texts of the Bible .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not with the Otmar ALT Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt , who has formulated his own interpretations of Biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 subjects .
The 75-year old has received his `` language '' with bright colours and imaginative shapes - which is by no means synonymous with `` funny '' pictures .
On the contrary : the respective topics adapted can have a quite quite bleak .
Three years , Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the `` book of all books '' .
Cycles , which are dedicated to topics such as the way of the cross , plagues , bids , or Lord 's prayer were created .
Thus he has fascinated spontaneously several partners : This applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as for the Kettler Verlag with its focus on art books .
And especially the author Klaus senior post , which dealt with the respective places of the Bible based on the painting .
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and so today , in the current context `` translated into '' .
These texts are like verbal mirror of old painting .
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and each set of the artist of who formulated his own personal thoughts on the situation here .
The cover of jewelry has golden letters .
Thus the 75th allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions double .
This is a high level of intimacy .
Emotions were ultimately ever trigger for the Bible project : Otmar Alt , 1940 in New York City born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Church order .
`` As the education happened already with the cane '' , recalls Otmar Alt .
`` I 've tried to work this might again get me along with the father '' .
His second concern was to restore the art to more important in fast-moving time : `` the perception of imagery is today characterized by advertising , and is noisy .
Symbolism is as displaced .
Artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
Images have always something mysterious and not decorative .
`` In this respect , I am a dinosaur '' .
Otmar Alt wants to , discover that the viewer into the pictures `` fall into '' , they let on , and feel what power they have : `` The image is looking his counterpart '' .
Klaus senior post admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar ALT Bible in the Otmar ALT Foundation , `` has always been '' a lover of Otmar ALTs art to have been : `` I like how he sees life with his paintings '' .
Old did not care fully to capture the Bible , but important , even mysterious themes selected for him .
Alte post `` That was no cooperation at eye level , '' says : `` this is the images , the text explains only '' . a picture Bible was created .
For Hans Möhler by Luther-Verlag , this work is an invitation `` to deepen his life and find freedom '' .
Otmar ALTs images speak the ( Biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility for Möhler .
A part of the original paper and canvas images - will be presented in an exhibition , which opens on November 15 in the Otmar ALT Foundation .

8 polls , which show that Donald Trump is to take seriously .
Some have tried to brand him as a flop .
Others have dismissed it as a joke .
And some are waiting for a breakdown .
But no matter , as some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump , down from the upper ranks in polls it did not work ( yet ) .
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in a double-digit lead , and some start to wonder what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul seriously .
Of course , it is still too early in the election period .
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry 's leadership was delivered to the ascending Herman Cain , of which no one won only one State in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and Club for growth , a conservative economic group recognize trumps stamina now and start to their dollars , to overthrow him .
Here are some recent survey values , indicating that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase .
Trumps popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees .
Before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a survey of the Monmouth University showed just that only two out of ten Republicans positive saw the real estate mogul .
By mid-July , it was 40 percent .
Beginning of August it was 52 percent .
Now , six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
And these numbers keep in early States .
In Iowa , a Quinnipiac poll stated last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump .
Two-thirds of GOP GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate .
67 percent of the Republicans said in a CNN/ORC poll last week , they were either `` enthusiastic '' or `` pleased '' If Trump was nominated .
Only two out of 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they were `` enthusiastic '' vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump ) .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 per cent .
On the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they were `` dissatisfied '' or `` angry '' , when Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would the candidate .
A majority of Republicans does not see trumps temperament as a problem .
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a President , so ABC News/Washington Post on Monday .
The same number is in the first area code State in the nation , the State of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander in Chief , according to the Quinnipiac last week .
Nevertheless , 44 percent think that he had not the personality to effectively execute his Office , and nearly six out of 10 independent say that suit his temperament not in the White House , according to ABC/post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
When they wear their hats of scholars , Republican voters keep Trump for real .
When asked , four out of ten say most likely to win the GOP nomination , according to a survey by CNN/ORC from last week that Trump was the best bet .
That 's a change since the time when four out of ten end of July put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP voters had in the past not the clearest crystal ball .
At this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination , compared to 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
However , shows that a large number of GOP voters view trumps campaign as plausible .
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate , Trump beats almost everyone .
Some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to trumps guidance , while the Trump support on more than a dozen other candidates is diffusely distributed .
But a survey of the Monmouth University early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and the most of the other Republican candidates , Trump Garners majority support .
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points ahead Walker 15 points before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally in front of RAND Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points .
It 's a head-to-head with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head .
A small majority of fans of Donald Trump says that they have formed their opinions .
A new CBS/NYT survey shows on Tuesday that only slightly more than half of the voters support the Trump , say that they have forgiven their votes out .
Of course , much can be done to change that , and no one can really say never to change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to other candidates .
However , trumps strongest competition is the other outsiders , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , at the moment , but voters who say that they have made their opinion , are twice as likely to Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration .
Since two months ago , Donald Trump `` Rapist '' in his campaign speech called immigrants from Mexico , immigration hub and pivotal point in public discourse was to 2016 .
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression critical of Trump Hispano Americans from the Republican Party will keep and will damage the efforts of locations .
But after the new ABC/Post poll from Monday , six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree the immigration questions with Trump .
As long as so remains the immigration in the spotlight , it will apparently do Donald Trump .
The frustration with the Government climbs to new highs .
About half of the support of Republican voters is on Donald Trump and Ben Carson by their outsider status .
The new Monday poll by ABC/post , six out of 10 Republicans say they 'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience .
And they are also angry at Washington .
A poll by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans about the Republicans in Congress are frustrated , with 54 percent `` terribly upset '' dissatisfied '' and 21 percent '' .

Rosbergs only currency : full attack
In the battle for the world title in the formula 1 against its clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton , Nico Rosberg knows only one motto : `` Full attack '' .
The World Cup second stressed before the start in the decisive seven overseas races , `` that I nothing left to lose '' .
53 points separate the Vice World champion before the night race in Singapore on Sunday from title holder and twice champion Hamilton .
The Briton won seven of the previous 12 races of the season and also takes the floodlit Grand Prix in the City State as a favorite in attack .
in 2009 , and last year the 30-year-old Briton won the race .
Whether the current smog in the City State on the Grand Prix of Singapore will have influence , is still unclear .
A haze over the city hangs for days , caused by fires on the island of Sumatra .

The mass that makes it : every two years the carmaker at the IAA show their new products .
2015 especially movement in the compact car is recorded , which are selling at the moment particularly well .
Cars from the compact class are currently most popular : about 28.1 percent of new registrations accounted for according to motor transport authority ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
This is reflected at the IAA ( public days from September 17 to 27 ) .
Between all the futuristic concept cars and new upper-class and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented this year .
The Opel Astra , which will be available in the fall at dealerships is one of the biggest premieres for the German car industry .
`` The Astra is an extremely important model for us , '' said Opel Chairman Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair .
It belongs to the core of the brand .
So that the solid model also sells , the new Astra for this will be much more expensive .
Opel represents an entry below the biggest competitor of VW Golf in Vista , which start at 17 650 euros .
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros .
There are the Astra with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW/100 HP .
Also the Hesse offer more diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 HP to 147 kW / / to 200 HP , which include for the first time three-cylinder petrol engine .
Unlike the main competitors of VW Golf and Ford focus is it the Opel Astra as a five-door hatchback .
As a second option , the station wagon will follow in the spring , which is already at the IAA .
And what will go next to the Astra at IAA on new compact cars ?
Renault Mégane : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane in the race .
The Mégane exclusively as a five-door in a conventional and an emphatically sporty GT version can be seen at the fair .
In the trade , he comes early next year , then as a station wagon .
Infiniti : Infiniti Q30 whole new is in the segment .
The Nissan branch wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model .
In the compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand .

On Wednesday , the Federal Cabinet decided a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which provides for investment in digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA auto show of a `` new age of mobility '' .
Automated and networked driving will improve road safety and congestion , said Dobrindt .
He wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries , which come together with representatives of the industry at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
The strategy paper of the Ministry of transport stresses the importance of the mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio .
A test track on the Highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being built for the testing of new technology .
So that the driver `` no additional liability risks imposed be '' , wants the Federal Government the legal framework `` review and , where necessary , adapt to new developments '' .
So Germany will advocate as internationally , increase the speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h .
The Federal Government wants to support also a change of the Vienna Convention , which provides for only the people as a driver .
When automated driving the car takes the lead in increasing , more and more the driver to the passenger .
The technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
According to a study presented by the Ministry of economy , highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020 .
Nevertheless , driverless vehicles on public roads were `` until well after 2020 to be expected '' .
The authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros will appreciate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany .
`` Can the digital networking of the car to the increased safety and efficiency in road transport lead '' , the transport politician Sören Bartol said .
The issue of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly understood .
Still , the Germans see self-driving cars sceptical - much more than French or Americans .
A survey presented on Wednesday to the AA of the Forsa Institute on behalf of the DEKRA testing organisation comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars over the next ten years will prevail , 32 percent believe only in 20 years , 31 percent believe it at all .
In France , 21 percent of respondents expect 33 percent by 2025 with self-driving cars in the United States .
Anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle .
According to a survey of the digital Association BITKOM , only seven percent would agree to relinquish control during the entire journey on all roads .
On the Highway 15 percent could imagine in traffic anyway , in a traffic jam 45 percent .
Every fourth car would leave control under any circumstances .

Poison control centers in the United States report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 who swallow strongly alcoholic disinfectant , so the Georgia Poison Center .
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , Director of the Georgia Poison Center , increased the cases of revenue of hand Sanitizer for children under 12 years , poison control centers report , 3,266 in 2010 on 16.117 in 2014 .
`` Children are the increase in these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room '' , Lopez told CNN .
He said that some children deliberately drinking disinfectant , while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a dare in social media .
YouTube videos show how young people drinking disinfectant only because a cheap experience .
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectant with benzene mouthwash to get a harder drink .
Younger children can be lured by attractive aromas of disinfectant .
`` A child does n't think that this is bad for it , '' Lopez said .
Many of the more attractive ( hand disinfectant ) are those that are scented .
There are disinfectant with Strawberry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children .
Disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
Particularly in young children , a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning .
`` It 's highly concentrated alcohol , '' said Dr. Stephen Thornton , Medical Director of the poison emergency call center at the Hospital of the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in Kansa city .
So , you would leave no SIP whisky standing around , but people let this hand disinfectant within reach of children , and when children come in , then it 's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year girl who recently had taken four splashes of after Strawberry scented disinfectant in the school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which applies in an adult by law as a drunk , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency room doctor who treated them at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
Nhaijah slurred her words and was not able to go , when she arrived in the emergency room .
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate hospital for children for signs of brain injury , because it had fallen girls by alcohol and himself had bumped his head , Ritchey said .
`` It was very scary , '' said Ortoria Scott , Nhaijahs mother , CNN .
It could be fatal for my child .
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and store disinfectants out of reach of the child .
About alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants with deaths were connected .
In the year 2013 , two women in Ontario died women after swallowing of hand disinfectant , which contained a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol , a lethal solution rather than ethyl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient .
In January three students in the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison her `` mean '' teacher , by they interpreted antibacterial products for the classroom '' , as it reports a police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to disinfectants and banished her from her room .
The police saw the foiled plan as `` Chatter '' and referred to disciplinary action to the School Board .

Already , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice of Enceladus .
So `` Cassini '' had discovered 2006 ice volcanoes at the South Pole of Saturn moon , which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn .

So if you try something else to do - this two are spontaneously mentioned examples where you imitate only that what is already on the market '' , said Mr Bingham .
BBC Director - General rejected the allegations and argued that Radio 3 far ahead of its commercial competitors is BBC , when it comes to live music and public education .
What I 'm learning from Radio 3 I will nowhere else learn about classical music .
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed .
`` And 3 , to find new music and to give new works , I think the commitment of radio really important , '' he said .
Earlier this year , BBC argued Radio 3 controller Alan Davey that harder work must be done to engage the audience , as it did in the past , because the British of less about classical music are informed .
However , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that it came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on culture , media and Sport Select to enter the commercial rivals on the feet .
The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked the voice - the musical talent show for the BBC , by the Dutch producer Talpa media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ was purchased .
See why this program is discussed often , because it 's not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - was produced with Paloma faith and Boy George as a judge - `` in a special BBC way '' .
He added that he hoped that the company `` find a hit from our own stable '' when it next time start a conversation series .
However , he refused to rule out ordering further rows of the voice in the future or to spend the fee payer for other entertainment formats .

Adam Lyth was threatened by exclusion from England 's team , but it 's still hard
Is a difficult task to come to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , but when you see the squad , England has selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not rule out an away win .
Alastair Cook 's side is less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will carry no scars of 2012 , only a teen positive attitude .
Moeen Ali developed as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid with the ball , even if it is an unknown quantity at the test level , is an option for the attack .
News related to this : Adam Lyth withdraws from the England test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales .
The decision to let Adam Lyth , is of course for me as his head coach in Yorkshire , hard to parse .
In his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players on results are aligned .
There were no question marks at Joe Root , for example , and that led players to the nomination , because - and I have said this before - are their own best selector .
Long ago , you would have extended the run of Lyth , but he was in control of his own destiny .
If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire , comes another chance .
The England coach of Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even though he did not so well , and that does n't surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to put his mark , is difficult .
Lyth got seven chances - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine .
Only Compton got the chance to home and away .
The only charge that you can charge was that England was Jonathan Trott set in in the Caribbean – first as a Lyth in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hales comes in , and he is a hit man , I value a .
He is an X factor cricketer , what we early saw at Yorkshire this season , when he scored 236 against us on a Trent bridge place , what really hit us .
It must have at least the same opportunities as those ahead of him , but of course this depends on the line-up in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea , hitting Moeen in addition to Cook , which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four Quicks , appeared , and I do n't mind .
I do n't see why a batsman there can not do , and this left-hander has already shown that he is a devil of a fellow of cricket players .
Moeen has perhaps not done his job for his County Worcestershire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there 's no big difference .
He joined as an opener in 2001 , my former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop .
He has managed three hundred runs immediately and did not look back .
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner , and in my limited dealings with him he really impressed me as a young man .
People might see his stats on - average 31 with the bat and the ball 35 - and think it 's a punt , but there is no large number of backup kooks who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Apart from the team , England has made a couple of clever additions with the coaching staff .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the batsman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup .
He is one of the nicest guys in the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cricket competition as a player or as a coach , and how Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from .
Sometimes , new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air even if the messages in accordance with the above .
Collys team-mate at Durham , Ben is not used Stokes , in the one-Dayers , root received a similar break against Australia and for my part , I have no problem with that .
Although some will not agree , but coaches and team operators determine not the schedule .
And you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
Such decisions are made not light hearted .

To compare : in this year , 260,000 units are finished in Germany .
Thus , 140,000 homes are missing .
Refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial recording accommodation after the first three months of their stay .
Many then encounter the housing market and ranks in the long queues in front of the rented accommodation .
According to the Federal Statistical Office , half of all asylum seekers for rent lived less than in the last year .
The negative development of the housing market is not only the rising numbers of refugees .
The study is also significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany put a housing deficit before him , which is growing from year to year .
Currently , approximately 770,000 units , were missing in the metropolitan areas complains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities inevitably in shared rooms .
Young adults were due to the downturn in the housing market involuntarily in the `` Hotel Mama '' .
In large cities the number of square meters per capita dropped for the first time in recent years .
To solve the problem , the Alliance of `` Social housing '' proposes a reboot .
In doing so , new incentives to stimulate social housing again .
So could the tax be avoided and are exposed to the real estate tax for subsidized apartments limited .
In addition , attractive tax depreciation allowances are necessary according to the Alliance .
The support programme for refugee shelters in the State Bank KfW is now well in cities and towns .
A week after starting more than half of the available around 300 million euros had been called off on Monday evening with 184 million euros already .
Now the project could even be increased .

Illegal torture devices - right at your doorstep !
The ads embarrass Britain 's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International anti-weapons trade shows video .
Terrible killer drones !
Leg cuffs zerschmetternde ankle !
Cluster bombs !
And electric shock rods that cause excruciating pain , but leave no trace !
The cheerful voice and the cartoon pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world 's largest arms fair is a combative parody , produced by Amnesty International , to bring the British Government into the spotlight , to sell arms to repressive regimes on the defence and security equipment international Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London 's Docklands .

`` You have done a fantastic job helping us to raise awareness on the sale of illegal torture devices at the show , '' says Tom Davies of amnesty .

Europe 's refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , holding back refugees
Hungary declared a State of emergency and the southern border with Serbia sealed off on Tuesday and detained everyone who tried everything with the aim of illegally in the country to come . to stop the influx of migrants .
Chaos followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no man 's land , and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
The people who had fled from violence , were stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of countries and built tents and settled there .
But frustrations have increased .
As a police helicopter over them was floating , chanted the migrants `` Will open the border ! '' and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police .
Some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia 's Foreign Minister said that it was `` unacceptable '' that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) want to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage .
It talks must take place in the coming days with Brussels and other countries '' , said Ivica Dacic in Prague .
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the block of 28 Nations could agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
The Ministers agreed , however , to share the responsibility for 40,000 people in the stunned Italy and Greece refuge sought . they expressed their hope from that , next month , or until the end of the year - an agreement would reached that EU States would absorb more than 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary , .

However , Hungary did not put his hopes on an early action from Brussels or from its neighbors .
State of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , so that they could shut off the roads and speed up asylum procedures .

CBS News correspondent Charlie D ' Agata reported that even prison inmates to create the barbed-wire fence between Hungary and Serbia , were used in the race .
In recent months , Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant bottleneck and the point of entry into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted , however , that are the most of economic migrants , who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees , who are entitled to protection - a view strongly at odds with other EU States , Germany , is among them .
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary , crossing the border or damage the 4-meter ( 13-foot ) high fence , which built the Government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws set higher sentences for convicted traffickers .
`` Due to the situation , which is caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government declared the State of emergency , '' Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
We make it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament must still agree to process even the use of the military , which is expected next week , but reporters from the Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days at the border .
Gyorgy Bakondi , country security adviser for Orban , said that authorities caught 45 people while trying to cross the border , 15 others had penetrated even deeper into the country .
They come by they damage the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of committing offences under the new laws .
Authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials signed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border crossings with Serbia , after a train car with barbed wire , arrived to close the borders .
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near the Roszke , Hungary , as the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and a crowd of people pressed to roll in there .
About 20 managed it to get in , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they may enter Hungary .

Jeremy Corbyns debut at Prime Minister 's question time
Since his election , Mr. Corbyns debut at question time of the Prime Minister with tension is expected
The new labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Minister 's question time and mess with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr CORBYN will rise shortly after noon to make the first of his six questions , with its performance by the media likely and the Labour Members closely examined .
He called for `` Less theatrical and more facts '' at this weekly event .
He has also said that he could skip some meetings , to leave to colleagues .
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyns leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the annual meeting of the TUC on Tuesday .
In the meantime , has provoked the decision of the labour Chairman , to remain on Tuesday while singing the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the battle of Britain in silence criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several front-page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyns decision to sing not the national anthem , has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr CORBYN said he would have `` in respectful silence been '' and he recognised the `` heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle of Britain '' .
But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told in the BBC two Newsnight programme he advised the labour Chairman , to sing the national anthem , `` regardless '' of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Almost a dozen of shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns top team and they refer to differences in economic , defense and foreign policy , while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
The BBC 's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also within `` stack of labour '' according to Mr Corbyns statements on the position of the European Union and limit profits .
Mr CORBYN said the TUC Conference that labour submit changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
Mr. Smith , the shadow work and pensions Minister said hours later that the party was `` very clear '' that it was only against the Government 's plans , the limit of 26,000 pounds to £23,000 to lower .
Mr CORBYN will be the fifth labour Chairman , David Cameron , since he became Tory leader , over the past decade on the dispatch box in the House , facing .
The labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says that he has `` Crowd-sourced '' ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and more than 30,000 suggestions were given to him .
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister 's question time is too confrontational , and that he will refrain from `` Repartee '' and fights with barbs both and instead has undertaken , to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality , and the challenges for young people .
Mr CORBYN said Angela Eagle , the shadow economic Minister will represent him if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is abroad .
He has brought the idea into the conversation , that other colleagues occasionally take the floor , and that he approached John Bercow , the speaker of the lower House , to discuss the problem .
When he became leader in the year 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove from the policy in the style of a `` puppet theatre '' , which is often associated with the Prime Minister question time is . but a few years later he admitted that he had failed .
Because it was sent first in 1990 in television , question time was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important barometer of the judgment of the leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that she had become a caricature , and would require far-reaching reforms .

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there are many other teams that last year requests sent after his impressive open training day end .
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision .
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench , when he so lost a tussle , the Aussie Rugby League convert did with his first punt-return on Tuesday when the 20-3 win over Minnesota .
But Tomsula entrusted his man and the next opportunity for a punt return and the running game gave Hayne after injury of Reggie Bush .
Tomsula continued to show its true face in the locker room after the game .
Rather than to grind his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tomsula strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game .
The 49ers sports reporter cam Inman reported that Hayne was encouraged by special teams Coordinator Thomas McGaughey , who advised him to forget his botched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jarryd Hayne messes with a punt , which was restored in the first quarter of the game of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start , Hayne and his massive Australian following for his NFL debut had hoped for .
Hayne left the field of play after the fumble cursing and told the Australian radio later duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could imagine a worse start in his NFL career .
`` That was a thing that happens now , they only care of the next game , and this is it , '' Hayne said .
Hayne compared the Carver with his origin debut back in 2007 , when a pass with led to a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area .
Overall , it was a great experience for the 27 years yet .

Certainly better knows David Cameron The Lorax ?
It 's one thing soon learn all parents : If your child loves a book , it is not long before you know it almost by heart .
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
When he was asked to name his favorite children 's book by a provider of childcare systems the Prime Minister chose the Lorax , the 1971 published environmental fable of Dr. Seuss .
It was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company of SuperCamps , and continues : `` funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my kids , because there seems to be a picture or a message that we 've been missing . ''
All well and good , except that the following paragraph in the Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , instead a summary the film version of 2012 reflects , which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
`` In the walled city Thneed-Ville , where all of nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams , he met her desire to see a real tree , by '' , reads one . A love interest was Dr. Seuss , the real name of Theodor Seuss which was hostage and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
If it still not suspicious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film , which will be presented on the Web site of Internet movie database and so begins : `` In the walled city Thneed Ville , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams . ''
Although he admits Yes to be a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron the plot of the book as little familiar is an unnamed boy , like the yarn local environment through the Thneed of money-grubbing , be felled trees , once-ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax , a crouching , moustached creature `` that speaks in the name of the trees '' , listen here is devastated .
Most likely , such a relatively low PR task to a helper has been delegated , not 20 times in a row has read the Lorax a child .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text probably came from Cameron 's electoral district office .
SuperCamps confirmed but no more immediate comments that the text was delivered by Cameron 's staff , was .

Refugees have safe passage : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
Hungary is practically impossible to get through more , as more and more refugees choose the path of Croatia .
Zagreb announced to grant transit via Slovenia to the North without hurdles .
The route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighboring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
`` I spoke with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior , and if it is necessary , we will arrange a corridor '' , the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
The EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
After the foreclosure of the Serbian-Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken up after Croatia , to get from there to Western Europe .
The Croatian television station RTL were 500 people come across the border at Tovarnik , reported .
Hungary had sealed off its border to refugees on the previous day .
New laws that came into force on the same day , practically eliminate , moreover , ordinary asylum procedure in Hungary .
Croatia wants to allow the refugees to pass .
The Croatian Minister Zoran Milanovic said : `` you can travel through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . ''
These people are there , they are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
However , there are people who wanted to live in Croatia .
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country Croatia in the morning .
Most came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan , according to media reports .
They came by bus , as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of SID .
Immediately after their arrival , they had tried to get to walk across the border to Croatia .
On the Croatian-Serbian border , the refugees may not encounter border fences .
For the border are other dangers : sharp mines of the Yugoslav civil war lie there in the 90s .
Deminers should quickly create a safe passage .
After Hungary , hardly more refugees come , however , after the closure of the border .
On Tuesday , the police counted 366 apprehended people .
It had been just before gate closure on Monday still 9380 .
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damage the security fence as a criminal offence .
Therefore 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated in the southern Hungarian city of Szeged .
Prison sentences threaten the person sentenced up to five years and deportation from the country .
We have 94 asylum applications according to the Immigration Department accepted on Tuesday in the `` transit zones set up anew at the border '' as a whole , almost all - 93 - at the main transition Röszke .
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two elderly people .
Would have stayed there 40 refugees on Wednesday morning .
Virtually no one has however granted asylum a prospect in Hungary to get .
According to Hungarian , Serbia is a `` safe third country '' .
The rejected asylum seekers will be deported there .
Before the `` transit zone '' in Röszke , only a few hundred refugees gathered .
Röszke started workers to clean up .
They collected the garbage , the tens of thousands of people had left in the past few weeks on the roadside .
Shutter grid were broken down and one of the centres in the border town was rebuilt .
No one wanted to talk about the aim of this restructuring .
Only a few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
The country has also strengthened its border controls .
To 20,000 migrants were according to government figures , but still in the country .
In Salzburg , people wait around 1400 on the onward journey to Germany .
Train services from there to Germany was halted in the morning on statement of German authorities .
Regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot arrived in Freilassing .

This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
Comes an increase in interest rates , and the bull market will be shaken , bond yields will rise , and the economy will slip into a recession .
We know that .
What we do n't know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
In particular , history offers little guidance to the end for the economy .
A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months .
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react .
Therefore , representatives of the US Federal Reserve have stressed so violently that investors should focus not on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather is the length of time required for the normalization .
In fact , several variables play a role .
At the end , market participants , however , may find that all the fuss because a rate increase was may be exaggerated .
`` The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of '' cheap money '' '' , said Julian Jessop , Chief Economist at capital economics , in a note to clients .
In contrast , we expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still at a too low level , to fear the to the seismic shock , many seem to lead .
However , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
Here is a look based on historical trends , as some areas of the economy could respond :
As the market has seen in the last month , the anticipation of interest rate increases can make volatile things for a while .
As soon as the increase , the impact is not so dramatic .
`` There is apparently a trend stalled investment income 12 to 24 months after the first increase which again reflects the delay in the monetary policy , '' said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after the Fed interest rate increases .
Specifically , the market is in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates , fairly flat in the 250 days ( average 2.6 percent gain ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average return in the last six past cycles of 14.4 % , according to a recent analysis , the Bob doll , Chief Investment Strategist at Nuveen asset management , at Barron 's published .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks later tend to occur in the cycle and the return begins to decrease .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but often promote increases in interest rates .
In the current case , the fed with some conditions is facing , which did not exist before and which could speed up a recession .
It is quite remarkable that gross domestic product near its lowest point the Fed 's interest rate increases will be .
According to Deutsche Bank was the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
Although the second quarter 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed .
Interest rate hikes in a so fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of `` whether it this time is different '' , said Deutsche Bank .
Market participants have made cool all year round on an interest rate increase in the fed , and all eyes were directed the meeting of the Federal open market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session , futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
`` In our study all increase in cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in the GDP have taken place and made previous recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade '' , according to the report .
In contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
The current cycle is by far the longest , the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far are 74 months .
The fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticipates a rate hike , and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market .
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares , if the change its strategic course .
For bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle .
At the end of the cycle , bond yields fall immediately , Deutsche Bank said .
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will cause that yields between shorter and longer bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve .
High-yield bonds better yields often bring in such a climate , although `` we are cautious to expect higher returns , '' said Kathy Jones , fixed income analyst at Schwab in an analysis .
Interestingly , Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to expectations of fed strategy .
`` There are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations '' she wrote .
Short-term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit spreads have been extended and the volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market if the Fed tightened up its strategy .
On the whole , companies which handle the greater part of their business in the United States , benefit if interest rates rise , and local products become more attractive .
Multinational companies with high levels of debt are worse position , as a rising dollar makes their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts .
`` History shows that '' Quality '' stocks tend to react , three months after an initial increase in interest rates very positive '' Sachs analysts in a report for the customers said Goldman .
Companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded after each of the interest rate increases by 5 percentage points in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 an average companies with weak balance sheet .
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their stocks exceeded even their counterparts with low quality on average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debt is a big problem .
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Goldman .
Outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
Savers could see profits through higher yields , although experts of disagree , how quickly this will happen .

Muslims buried in Mecca killed in the crane accident - bin Laden family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims in the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia puts the huge Saudi bin Laden group to load the collapse partially

Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of victims were carried through the streets to bury , who were killed when a crane at Mecca 's great mosque .
Mourners filled , largely dressed in white , the route to pay their respects , as the first of the dead began their final journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem .
The funeral procession passed in the holy place , where just days before a crane through the roof of the mosque and then on the prayerful crashed .
The bodies were released for burial , as the Saudi King about the family construction company for the disaster , which left also 394 injured , imposed a sanction bin Laden .
The bodies of 29 pray , who were killed when a crane by the large central mosque Mecca , were carried through the streets .
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton , greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane crashed down .
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj in the Grand Mosque .
Saudi officials have confirmed already , that the will go on Hajj to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
Today , King Salman said the bin Laden group should not have stand the arm of the crane , when it is not used .
An Arabic version of the Decree , which was published by the State Saudi press agency , said that the bin Laden group for the collapse was partly responsible .
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company are prohibited to travel abroad .
To reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the great mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims on the Hajj , which takes place later in the month , gathered earlier this week promised Salman .
The bin Laden group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were for an opinion not be available .
The Royal Decree reprimanding the group because not current security measures and because she have not cooperated with meteorologists .
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mecca large mosque as part of the massive construction project , which is headed by the bin Laden group .
The family bin Laden is linked for decades with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and takes over major construction projects .
The late leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a renegade son who was dispossessed by the family in the 1990s .
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
Officials said that 158 people in the hospital stay .
Government officials ordered that 1 million rial ( £ 174,000 ) to the families of those killed are to be paid and the same amount to permanently injured .

Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
Earlier it wanted on the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen to meters .
The embroidered fabrics and lace were built in large quantities for customers who processed it to blankets and curtains .
That alone no longer , explained Andreas Reinhardt , Managing Director of the fashion tip of Plauen .
Instead , the fashion is important again .
In the early days of the Plauen lace fashion played a major role , was then replaced by the home textile industry - and now is being rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt cited some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
Even the so-called vintage clothing , similar to past eras , make a growing job potential .
Who uses any niches in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market .
With us they account for half of all orders .
Fashion tip Plauen along with nine other companies is a member of the industry association of Plauen lace and embroidery .
They may carry the protected label .
In the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales were broken off .
There are almost no longer private shops and also wholesale .
Our products reach the customer in this way hardly .
The mass-produced will today much more cheaply produced in Asia and sold almost exclusively through chains .
Also schwächle the export , currently in the United States and Russia .
Plenty of reasons for new ways .
Industry Association tries to score as Cordula Bauer of the embroidery bead in Falkenstein explained through environmental awareness : `` Since this year , we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable '' .
Reinhardt added : `` This refers to the materials used '' .
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of applied arts - and is specialized in embroidery and lace .
To counter the competition from Asia , we must find high-quality and innovative products .
That takes time and courage .
`` There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies need to think above all , economically , '' says Schmidt .
Therefore , an existing design will often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
A few years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip .
In doing so , the machine in some places embroiders small beads .
The Plauener goldsmiths champion Bianca Hall Bach Krauße was inspired : `` Before I could do anything with traditional Plauen lace '' .
Now use the snowball tip for her jewelry .
In a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
`` Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauen lace - young and old '' , says Reuter .
It provides in the United States , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose driving out in Plauen and the surrounding area have lived and who want a souvenir .
So I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of Plauen lace .

Stevan Hogg used phone from girl to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse .
Stevan Hogg took the girl 's phone when this slept , logging into an online messaging service from which he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user .
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg .
She saw it through , found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother .
The police took care and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered `` concerned '' web search that used terms for searching indecent images of children .
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he did it , as it would lead to `` paedophiles on the Internet '' and he then `` pretended to be a policeman to scare them . ''
The prosecutor , Eilidh Robertson , told Dundee Sheriff Court : `` He said it would be an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people .
He admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles .
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
He said he did it to lure them .
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking , and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
Ms Robertson added : `` When the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trepidation and on the wines .
She then also saw the indecent images on the phone and confrontational the defendant .
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and Playstation to speak with girls who looked much younger than him .
Hogg , 23 , of Ward Road , Dundee , pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to include indecent images of children on June 14 last year , on 25 January this year , against the conditions , and did not appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders as one could argue that `` no significant sexual element '' could be found in his offense .
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases .
He was admitted to the directory of sexual offenders before the date of the ruling .

The last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
Secret revealed ?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows , Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have been unknowingly obvious who wins The Bachelor .
The woman , at whom Sam Wood eventually landed in The bachelorette , was wrapped in greatest secrecy .
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay , Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before coming out of three two , you may have inadvertently given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until Thursday 's final
All three women have missed out on lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
However , if the question is asked `` If not you , who should get Woods last rose ? '' could become their answers to the playoff , who won the heart of the bachelor 's .
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood .

I 've seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
From her point of view , Mackay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood could be `` the one . ''
`` As soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this was obviously not just a game - I am now unreserved to him , '' she said .
And when asked who Wood should choose , if not her , she was puzzling .
`` I do n't know if I can say that , '' she said .

Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
At the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is a new medical director at Schongau Hospital .
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau .
This is due to the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Landkreis , the landlady Andrea Jochner-White confirmed .
However , a decision is made by the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will take place next Wednesday , 23 September .
If the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would be employed .
The vast majority should move with fishermen and the nearby station to Schongau .
The rooms are in place .
The staff , who can not go to Schongau , is to be offered a job in Weilheim , according to Jochner-White .
The staff were briefed on the plans .
The change was caused by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder , who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
On the question of who is to succeed , according to Jochner White , the name `` Fischer '' came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and switch with his team to Schongau .
For the house in Schongau , this means , in any case , an `` appreciation '' and a broadening of the offer in the area of `` Internal Medicine , '' according to Jochner White .
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators .
Schongau ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases .
For the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the workforce , which still has more than 35 beds , to be closed in Peißenberg after nearly 140 years .
Until now , the county had planned this for 2018 when the current clean-up at Weilheim hospital has been completed .
Landlady Jochner-White , who is also chairwoman of the supervisory board , joined rumours that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as a shelter for asylum seekers in the future .
`` I conclude that , '' as it continues with the property , Jochner White could not say there were several considerations .
At the moment there is a short time care for Caritas and a daily psychiatrics .
`` What better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , '' Fischer said about the quasi-move to the Lech , which was `` positive and very understanding '' by the staff .
A real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has worked as a chief medical officer for over 30 years , has not given up .
He was asked by Schongauer 's colleagues to take up the post of medical director .
Peißenberg 's hospital ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example , surgery and obstetrics .

BBC should abandon Eastenders , says former boss of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice , saying that commercial rivals would `` give their right arm '' for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK-Sones .
He criticised the BBC for making public programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard-pressed time windows against the most popular shows by their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4 .
After the BBC director-general , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he spent six years in his time at Channel 4 without success trying to come into contact with the BBC .
`` I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broadcast that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals , '' Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee in his inquiry on the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term , it should at least be based on programmes that others do not make or mandate .
They send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future .
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it 's ridiculous , it 's nonsense , of course .
Johnson said : `` I do n't see why a regressive tax program is funded , which could also be funded without subsidies .
The Voice is such a program , Eastenders is another , admittedly both in-house productions .
To be honest , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I am trying to see how this should be public-law television .
I do n't think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who chaired Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for valuations `` because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support . ''
His comments on the BBC 's most popular broadcasts give this back to what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows such as Eastenders .
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programs `` should go to BBC4 , where you ca n't measure the audience pretty much , but they are fulfilling their tasks , and they can argue that if they go on their seeming missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , `` Well , of course , we 've created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen . ''
They put them in a window of opportunity in which no one ever wanted to see them .
On the radio charge , Johnson told the committee : `` I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
Of course , you all think we all think you get a big value for £150 a year here , but for people who are for the £150m a lot of money , I wonder if that 's true , because they do n't consume much of the BBC .
Former Sky- and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to `` inform , educate and entertain . ''
He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 per cent of its TV production and 0.1 per cent on the radio - and it should set an example to public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this in `` inform , enlighten and entertain . ''
On the issue of partnerships , Elstein said , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online .

Who smokes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke will harm not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long-term study .
The good news : In the case of abandonment , the risk falls quickly .
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
This is based on the long-term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
Compared to non-smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely , hitting the 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher .
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants .
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DIfE .
For these periodontitis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasize the authors .
So the link between smoking and tooth decay is due to more frequent gum infections in smokers .
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk for caries .
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , the researchers wrote in the Journal of Dental Research .
However , it could take more than ten years to put the risk back to the level of non-smokers , explained Erdutor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
People need to be persuaded to become non-smokers , study leader Heiner Boeing told DIfE : `` Smoking is shortening the lifetime . ''
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health to the high age .
In Germany , over 20 percent of the population ages 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness , the DIfE said .
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure .
The new long-term study underpins the findings .

Rosberg 's only motto : Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the battle for the WMD title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton only one motto : `` Full Attack . ''
The World Cup second stressed before the start of the crucial seven overseas races , `` that I have nothing to lose . ''
53 points separate the vice-chancellor ahead of the post-split in Singapore this Sunday of defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton .
The Briton has already won seven of the previous 12 seasons and is also taking the Brisbane Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
In 2009 and last year , the 30-year-old Briton could win the race .
Whether the current smog in the city-state will influence the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear .
A dunk bell has been hanging over the city for days , triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra .

Smugglers soft on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major control points on the German-Austrian border .
Many smugglers left for fear of discovery and arrest people more at smaller border crossings
Out on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the federal police said .
Along the border River Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the counties of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday .
They were walking through bridges and dams on the German side .
There , they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration .
At Munich 's main railway station , according to Federal Police Department data , there were once again a lot more refugees in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday .
About 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
Following the reintroduction of checks on the German-Austrian border , on Tuesday , 1759 refugees had reached the city .

Croatia : `` We let the refugees through ''
`` Well , border controls are also ramping up on our southern border , '' said Interior Minister Johanna Mikltiktner .
The controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel .
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum could also make it `` self-evident . ''
People 's supply and security are paramount .
But it is also clear that it needs clear signals , '' the minister said .
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migratory flows , even over the Austrian-Slovenian border .
It takes a controlled approach .
Croatia considering 'corridor ' - Slovenia denied
The Croatian Government had previously said that Slovenia , too , wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also set up corridors for the refugees .
However , the interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see it .
The idea of corridors is `` absolutely unacceptable , '' Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary .
The border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
As the Minister pointed out , Slovenia does not want to impose its limits on refugees .
`` Every EU member has to fill out his obligations , otherwise the system can not work , '' Györkös Znidar pointed out .
As the Croatian Government pointed out , the first refugees would have tried to arrive at the Tovarnik/sid border crossing in eastern Croatia at the time of the night , in order to escape the registration .
Croatian police were able to pick them up in nearby corn fields .
According to local media , there have been regular police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian Tovarnik .
These are mainly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
Emergency services and the Red Cross are also already deployed .
In the coming days , his country will have about 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic .
In addition , buses from Presevo on the Macedonian border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diverted towards Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday .
The government in Belgrade , however , is saying that it is up to the people to adopt certain routes : `` neither can we , nor do we want to do this , '' it said .
According to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid , in the course of the day , more buses would be expected .
About Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates were travelling all night from the roughly 500-kilometer Macedonian border through Serbia .
`` We heard that Hungary had made up , so the police told us that we should go here , '' said one of the refugees .
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
This could , in fact , lead to a slightly further west end of the previous wave of observers already predicted by observers of the previous Balkan route to Turkey .
Croatia : 'comprehensive opportunities for border control '
Croatia 's interior minister , Ostojic , had previously stressed that his country was preparing for the case of a strong influx of refugees with appropriate plans for possible emergency situations .
He did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia , as a non-Schengen member , had `` comprehensive opportunities for border control . ''
Use strict controls to qualify for membership of the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have been a good witness to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
On the Serbian side , some 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence .
According to Belgrade media reports , they would have spent the previous night at the Horgos crossing , which leads to Röszke .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked .
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local witness in Horgos : He considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
There would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment .
One could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
Aid workers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia , however , is not dangerous : In parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war still not cleared mine fields .
On Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners was sent in the border region .

Xavi : PEP Guardiola prevented from switching to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
The FC Bayern clearly stood a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain 's superstar Xavi , who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time .
Eight times Spanish champions , three times postseason winners , four times Champions League winners , two times club champions , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is staggering .
In the summer , the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar .
But in an interview with the Marca , Xavi now reveals he was already ahead of Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona .
`` You told me that Barça wanted to sell me . ''
`` Madrid won everything at the time , we did nothing , '' he tells me .
And that also registered the FC Bayern .
Xavi : `` There was an offer from Bayern . ''
`` Rummenigge wanted to have me . ''
Remember : In the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern .
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did n't switch
The change , however , did not materialise .
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record master : PEP Guardiola .
Xavi explains why : `` Barça has taken Guardiola under contract and I 've played a great EM . ''
`` PEP told me that I would n't change , that he could n't imagine the team without me . ''
`` With that , he got me . ''
Who knows how Bayern 's 2008/2009 season would have run with Xavi .
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the grass , snapped the Red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the premier league triumph at the end .

Matt Damon plays diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confrontted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight , the experienced actor interrupted Brown when that emphasized the need for alternative perspectives , in reference to a black protagonist in the project 's chosen script .
`` When we talk about diversity , you do it at the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , '' Damon asserted .
Brown reacted shocked , with insulting disbelief and called `` Hoo ! WoW . Okay , '' when the actor 's comments rallied from The Martian .
Damon and Brown joined the show 's producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists .
`` I want to ask people to think about this - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , '' Brown said first .
The only black person , and she 's a nutter , beaten by her white pimp .
The producer of Dear White People campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the reigning rights to the film ; Damon replied that her directing `` in the end could give us something we do n't want . ''
After the discussion was broadcast , the social media exploded ahead of disapproval over Damon 's comments .
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing `` Matt Damon talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that 's SO WEISS that it hurts . ''
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 Likes since its release .
Damon 's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014 , the movement hit Black Lives Matter nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against Farens .
In February , the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards .
`` Album still matt , '' ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
Like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
More recently , leaders of the Movement Black Lives Matter have released a statement , in response to the issue of fox-news personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck , whether the group should be considered a hate group .
`` The network Black Lives Matter is a love group , '' the leaders said .
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers , producers and media mogule who will be invited to visit the pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West .
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear .

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia 's enhanced military support for Syria is : `` There is no military solution '' of the nearly five years of conflict , and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people .
The UN chief once again urges all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the council 's five permanent member nations - US , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly 's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
He regretted that the divisions in the council and within the Syrian people and regional powers `` make this situation intractable . ''

Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts at the company 's services .
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and its service business activities .
The expected jobless rate leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
`` These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new HewPackard Enterprise , '' said Meg Whitman , HP 's chairman and chief executive , who is to head the unit after the separation .
`` Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of deals that support companies in the transition to a new style of business , '' Whitman said .
As an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion in annual sales and `` will be focused on providing previously unmet , integrated technology solutions for companies , '' according to a statement from the company .
It divided a company founded in the 1930 '' s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric plants and whose Palo Alto garage was called `` the birthplace of Silicon Valley . ''
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
The measure of HP , the world 's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the belief that narrowly focused companies provide better performance .

Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after its move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams that sent questions after its impressive open training day at the end of last year .
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomatoes and it looks like a wise decision .
Some coaches would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a straight game as it did to the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertit at his first Punt-Return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota .
But Tomatoes trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a Punt-Return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush .
Tomatoes continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
Rather than grind his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tomatoes also boosted Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game .
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey , who advised him to forget his patchy catch and take care of the next game .
Jarryd Hayne patted at a punt that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for his NFL debut .
Hayne left the pitch after the fumble fluke and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could n't imagine a worse start to his NFL career
`` That was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that 's it , '' Hayne said .
Hayne compared the lumber with his Origin debut at the time in 2007 , when a pass in his own in-goal range led to a Try for Queensland .
Overall , however , it was a great experience for the 27-year-old .
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and post it on his Instagram .

Officials from Aich/Dob due to infidelity in court
On Wednesday , two officials from the Austrian volleyball vice-chancellor , Aich/Dob , were to be held responsible for infidelity and dismissal .
The defendants pleaded not guilty .
One of them had also been charged with abuse of power .
He has been formally acquitted of this allegation in May .
The current trial was adjourned .
According to District Attorney Robert Riffel , in the preliminary investigation , it emerged that , in 2006 to 2011 , the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to use in their functions for private purposes .
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros .
Sports officials are also charged with financial offences .
This fact left the head of the Council of Scots , Judge Michaela Sanin .
It is to be negotiated at a later date .
To dismiss the infidelity , the defense set out that the club had not created an asset afterward at any time .
Sports officials had only billed expenses and sued the sports club , for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 were around 600,000 shillings ( about 44,000 euros ) .
`` At that time , we stood in front of the situation : Do we continue or block the club ? '' he told one of the defendants , in the bread profession of the Financial Office .
With his colleague and co-defendant , he then decided to take on that task .
With all the risks .
`` We have put forward money , our life insurance as security at the bank , '' he said at concussion .
The association has been agreed : You can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made .
Furthermore , in the event of a corresponding financial success , the payment of expenses retroactive to 1991 has been decided .
As a result , some of the expenses were paid only years later , as from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
Therefore , flat and non-detailed bookings seemed to be the case , the former Obman explained the events .
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together , the second defendant said .
Why the payouts had not been fully disclosed to the club , the judge asked .
The association was not interested in the detail of financial management , important only was debt freedom , according to the response .
When , in 2011 , against an official investigation into abuse of office , an amount of €120,000 was transferred to the association 's account .
These were resignations , the defendants said .
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the club , according to its statement .
`` Why ? '' the judge wanted to know .
The respondents did not know the answer for a long time .
He eventually said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
If something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about that money , the prosecutor put in the room .
The co-accused had been informed , justified by the official .
This bank transfer has been formulated as a `` damage recovery . ''
Why claim damages ? , wanted Judge and prosecutor to know .
On that , the first defendant declared that he did not agree with that wording because the association had never been harmed .
But what should I do when the lawyer says , `` With that , you 're all out of the tailor . ''
`` Am I a legal representative ? '' he asked .
In addition , the official said he never paid a cent salary , he only billed mileage fees and diets .
On diets , he billed the club £1,000 a month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
Exact documents for the early years could not show the defendants .
These were no longer preserved after an operating audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they said .
Mileage allowance had also been referred to the second defendant .
All sticking points were made in cash , to which he would have to move from his hometown of international market to the bank to Bleiburg , he explained in his statement .
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses .

Refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary there is virtually no passing , as more and more refugees choose the road to Croatia .
Zagreb announces that there will be no hurdles to travel across Slovenia to the north .
The route is dangerous , however .
Croatia wants to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
`` I spoke to the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , '' said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
Following the isolation of the Serbian Hungarian border , there are hundreds of refugees left to Croatia in order to get to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik , the Croatian television channel RTL reports .
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the previous day .
New laws , which came into force on the same day , make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explained : `` You can go through and we are preparing for that possibility . ''
These people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
However , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
In the morning , the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia .
Most were media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
They came with both the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of Sid .
Immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
On the Croatian border , the refugees do not cross border fences .
There are other dangers for this : There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 1990s .
Mine cleaners are now expected to quickly create a safe passage .
After Hungary , however , after the closure of the border , there are little more refugees .
On Tuesday , police counted 366 recorded people .
Just before Torture on Monday , it was still 9380 .
The new Hungarian laws include overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged .
Those convicted face sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
According to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the newly established `` transseat zones '' on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - of the most important passage of Röszke .
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
On Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees there .
In practice , however , no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
According to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a `` safe third country . ''
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
Before the `` transit zone '' in Röszke , only a few hundred refugees gathered .
In Röszke , workers started to clean up .
They collected the rubbish that left tens of thousands of people on the roadside in recent weeks .
Barricades have been dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border area has been rebuilt .
No one wanted to comment on the aim of this restructuring .
Austria has only a few refugees following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
The country has also reinforced its border controls .
As a result , the 20,000 migrants were still in the country , according to government figures .
In Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
Train traffic from there to Germany was halted in the morning on the orders of German authorities .
On a regular basis , smaller groups of refugees have been found on foot .

Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season was n't particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers .
Earlier , they were once one of the best teams in baseball , today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central .
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 at Target Field .
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot .
For Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F-word that was so difficult to grasp over much of the second half of the season .
`` All the wins are fun , no matter how it comes , '' Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said .
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13-9 ) struck out 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three Runs .
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
`` I want to finish strongly this year , '' Simon said .
It 's hard to throw in the bullpen every game , and so I want to be very focused in the game .
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs , his first rbis since mid-August .
It was Martinez 's first triple hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6 .
`` He has swung the batter well , '' Ausmus said .
He looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked significantly better out of the bullpen , and he brought it straight into the game .
With three Runs in the backside at the end of the seventh innings , the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game .
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks hit a bunt , and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by the left-hander Blaine Hardy .
Hardy overran wall , the only man he faced before the presumptive rookie batter Miguel Sano , who tore the right-hander Drew Verhagen a Two-Run .
With a pair of runners and the final rally at the second , Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play .
It was that in the Major League leading 27 times this season that Plouffe suggested a double play
After Detroit added an Insurance-Run at the end of the ninth innings , Wall made an RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5-4 .
However , the right-hander stole Sano at three pitches for his fifth save .
Detroit profited to the start of the game from an even non-movable Phil Hughes .
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran , who had been dropped from the injury list before the game after missing more than a month because of a back injury .
`` Obviously not the start I wanted , '' Hughes said , `` but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning . ''
After they got in the first of the leaderboard , Halpin gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler .
A Two-Out Walk for J.D . Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game , creating a single `` up the middle '' at the first run of the game .
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 track record with the Runners in scoring position .
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right , creating another run , but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to third , which ended the threat .
The Tigers put in the second , scoring a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a Two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0 .
`` It was a big blow , '' said Twins-manager Paul Molitor .
He did n't score particularly well , but he caught the right spot .
Hughes was in a pitch-count , scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the relever right-hander A.J.Achter .
At Hughes , there were three Runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts .
Notes : Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez departed because of an injury to the throwing shoulder .
He is being investigated by Dr James Andrews , who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid-August on the injury list because of a shoulder strain , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
With Sanchez out of the game , LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins .
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 because of a tie-up in the right hip .
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris ( 2-2.4.43 ERA ) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana ( 5-4 , 4.73 )

Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement , as well as Tehran 's destabilizing measures in the Middle East .
At the meeting , however , it is also a question of the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that is being discussed .
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington criticizes Israel 's ongoing settlement construction , accusing Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process .
Through the deal brokered by Obama over Iran 's nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteriorated further .
In March , Netanyahu , at the invitation of Republicans before the U.S. Congress , delivered a controversial speech that was partly regarded as an affront to Obama .
The speech was not agreed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .

For slightly overweight diabetics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with Type 2 diabetes can take at least five years , according to a new study .
It 's too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data need a long time to show something , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a sergeant to the new study in JAMA Surgery .
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
Over the years , obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are disease-prone with a body-mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , the researchers from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they collected in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach ulcers and stomach mud - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
Meanwhile , BMI remained among those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments roughly the same at 29 .
Among those undergoing surgery , 36 % solved the diabetes disease completely and at 28 % .
In the medical-treated group , in comparison , diabetes only dissolved at one per cent and partly at only about two per cent .
In addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the triglycerides and the `` bad '' LDL cholesterol `` generally better in the 'surgical ' group , '' the authors found out .
The researchers also monitored the patient 's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
After the operation , average hemoglobin A1c levels fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
But this better `` glycemic control '' - as you are reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to veteran researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the guest rectomy group ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , reaching larger declines in BMI ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded more of a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.9 % vs. 16.7 % ) .
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Blackstone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
In the Swedish study , it was among obese people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years -- compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival among the surgeon 's patients , Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
`` This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , '' without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30 .
`` I think we wait too long before we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that once they 've collected these genetic changes that have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really hard . ''

District attorney 's office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined together under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new one-stop shop at Graf-Stauffenberg Square .
In addition to consultation , you can also participate in courses .
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
To be more precise , at the Graf-Stauffenberg Square .
A new district office has recently been opened .
Here , right next to the purchasing market , from now on , seniors and council members receive information on issues such as care insurance or services of sick and nursing homes .
For years we have been using our outpatient care service to ensure that carers are left alone .
There are an infinite number of questions .
`` Also , not often many benefits of the coffers are not used , because the complexity of the insurance industry is barely understood , '' explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand , who as a business division manager for AltenAid is also responsible for the Antonista and Citizens Hospital , as well as for the outpatient service `` Amadeus . ''
In addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
To this end , the Saludis was taken to the boat .
Therefore , you can use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment .
The offers from the senior center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way .
Saludis stands for prevention , prevention and rehab .
`` The senior center for care and care , '' explained Heike Riedel , Managing Director of Saludis .
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future indispensable .
In addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metzner ( SPD ) underscored the opening ceremonies , dedicating the district attorney 's office to the age : `` There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular sociable get-together . ''
In doing so , the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently as possible and well in their familiar environment .
The district attorney 's office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

EU Commission proposes in row over TTIP new court
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that is much more traditional in the way it works .
`` We want to establish a system that citizens trust , '' the EU commissioner , Cecilia Malmström , said in the presentation .
The Swede is proposing to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States .
The German government announced support .
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people .
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically stipulate that the EU Member States and the United States will jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court .
They are to be made to equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
For the first time , there is also a second instance .
It would allow it to appeal against verdicts .
Until now , the procedural parties agreed with each other on referees , an appeal against their sentences did not exist .
In the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and fairness .
In the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court , according to its own data .
There , for example , there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU Member States .
The investor-state arbitration procedures ( ISDS ) demanded by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
The traditional arbiters are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , over which companies claim compensation at the expense of taxpayers , erode national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
In the first statements , anti-TTIP organisations , such as Campact , described the EU Commission 's proposals as inadequate .
It has been criticised , in particular , that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CETA ) .
The German Business Secretary Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major step forward .
The Commission takes account of key points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sigmar Gabriel , has drawn up with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
The old system of private arbitration is off the table .
The French government also welcomed Malmström 's plans .
The European business association , BusinessEurope , warned against restricting the economy 's actions by too many new rules .
Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be put at a disadvantage , it was said .
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013 .
The issue of investor protection , however , has not been discussed with the US .
Originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
This date is considered to be no longer tenable .

The head of JD Sports says higher wages jeopardize expansion .
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean `` more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . ''
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company , he says .
The cost could hit JD Sports 's expansion plans , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs .

Seven 's Sunrise dominates the ratings , despite Nine 's attempts to take on the loss of leadership at the Today show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of the Liberals ' lead , but there has been no major shifts in ratings for Today .
Nine 's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott .
The rival Sunrise , with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage , was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows , including Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
This disadvantage of the deal seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise posted an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to Today 's 339,000 .
Today posted a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 317,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 283,000 ) , but its number fell short of the last Thursday ( 343,000 ) .
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months .
In August , Today averaged 318,000 compared to the 33,000 of Sunrise .
At the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
So far in September , Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at Today .
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of arrangers to the Rafters Erik Thomson .
The new drama about a recently widowed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers .
Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney .
The result last night answered this with a clear `` yes . ''
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block ( 838,000 ) and TBL Families ( 726,000 ) .
Seven had mixed results in evening two of The Chase Australia .
The first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.30 p.m. ) of the new quiz show , moderated by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers .
The second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat ( 613,000 ) .
On Monday night , the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour satte 720,000 .
Hot-Seat averages 620,000 .
The drop in the odds of the second night of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
The Chase Australia is a replacement for $ 1 million minute it did not manage to evade the McGuires show .

Boll says team and doubles start at table tennis championships
Düsseldorf wants to win the title battle from 25 September to 4 October .
The final decision is to fall no later than 22 September .
`` This is a huge loss for our team . ''
`` The guys experienced it in the morning . ''
`` We are strong enough , even without Timo to get the title , '' said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the EMC course in Düsseldorf .
At this time , Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsorship deal in China .
The 34 year-old German master is expected to return on Friday .
`` Without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , '' stated individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov .
The Hamelner , who leads the betting list in Jekaterinburg , also recalled the Euro 2013 in Schwechat .
`` At that time , Timo was also missing , and we 've become European champion . ''
`` We should be guided by this , '' declared the world number one .

No diet frenzy - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy sweet .
But those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often more likely to get away from them .
Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially Saccharose .
Healthy are the exotic fruits anyway : In them B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-cartin .
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
When buying , mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant smell .
The bowl colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very delicious .
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
Then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet food .
A mango , however , also gives hearty dishes a special note .
It alleviates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf seeds such as Chicoree and Radiccio .
And a mangochutney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and venison .

BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of Parliament criticised the station for its `` dumbing ''
He argues that he is increasingly not distinguished from commercial rivals .
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said she only imitated The Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 `` is transforming '' to Classic FM , claiming a leading member of parliament and raising new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something the private broadcaster does not do .
The Conservative MP , Andrew Bingham , also told BBC bosses that the public broadcaster was `` stupid '' and increasingly no longer different from its commercial competitors .
`` Radio 3 seems - I do n't like to use the word `` stupid '' - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , '' he said .
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which launched last December .
The BBC Music Awards , which launched last year , seem to be The Brits just under a different name .
So if you 're trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only imitate what is already on the market , '' said Mr Bingham .
BBC director-general dismissed the allegations , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness .
What I learn from Radio 3 , I wo n't learn about classical music anywhere else .
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed .
`` And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioned new works , I also really think it 's important , '' he said .
Earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it needed to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because Britons are less informed about classical music .
However , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport to replace commercial rivals on their feet .
The Tory-MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC 's musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million .
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced `` in a special BBC way . ''
He added that he wants the company to `` find a hit out of our in-house stall '' when it launches an entertainment series next time .
However , he refused to exclude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the fee payers for other entertainment formats .

Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England team , but it 's still hard
Hitting on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you look at the cadres that England have chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 Test defeat is not on my card .
I would n't rule out an upside .
Alastair Cooks 's side may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin-players in the battle line-up , and the community spirit is strong ; they wo n't wear scars from 2012 , just a youthful positive attitude .
With the ball developing Moeen Ali as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown size at Test level , is an option for the attack .
Related news : Adam Lyth drops out of the England Test cadres and is replaced by Alex Hales .
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yorkshire , hard to analyse .
In his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on outcomes .
There were no question marks at Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nomination , since - and I 've said this before - players are their own best selections .
A long time ago , it would have extended the course of Lyth , but he had control of his own destiny .
If he hopes to make further runs for Yorkshire , there is another chance .
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even though he did n't perform such good performances , and that does n't surprise me ; he 's mainly a team man .
The question of how much time a test drummer gets to set up his sign is difficult .
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine .
Only Compton got the chance to go home and out .
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in maximum form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex Hales comes in , and he 's a batting man , whom I value highly .
He 's an X Factor cricket player , what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch , which hit us very much .
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this , of course , depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of beating Moeen alongside Cook , which would provide an extra spin-off bowler and received four Quicks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I do n't see why a batter ca n't beat there , and this left-hander has already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricketer players .
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there 's no big difference .
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before appearing as an opener in 2001 .
He managed three hundred Runs immediately and did not look back .
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a back-up-spinner , and in my limited dealings with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
People may look at his stats - an average of 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a punt , but there 's not a large number of backup spiders who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Aside from the team , England have made a couple of smart additions to the coach .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the batsman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master ercoup .
He is one of the nettest guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood arrives for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mahela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind , even if the news is in line with what was previously said .
Collys teammates at Durham , Ben Stokes , will not be used at the One-Dayers , Root received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with that .
Some wo n't agree , but Coaches and team members do n't determine the schedule .
And you have to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
Such decisions are not taken lightly .

Outdoors voters are calling for the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees .
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the start of the FW Autumn column in major wallabies in the run-up to a serious crisis in Bavaria 's schools , if there is no corresponding new teacher for the many new pupils : `` We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse , '' Aiwanger said .
`` Otherwise , we will get disruption in the Bavarian education system . ''
The holiday party of the Free voters will be held in the Lower Franconian Municipality until Friday .
In fact , there were other main issues .
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Election Meeting .
`` Of course , the subject of asylum will outsource the Klausur , '' Aiwanger said .
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it did during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s .
`` So it 's not going to continue , we have to get to the causes , '' said the Free Election Chief .
Rejected asylum seekers want to push off free voters as soon as possible .
That 's why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum lawsuits : `` We also need at least 50 new asylum judges , '' Aiwanger said .
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent : `` We need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide . ''
`` Bayern pushes off , others do n't . ''
`` Because we need to become more effective . ''
But national politics in big wallabies should not fall under the table .
A long standing burner remains on the agenda : Education policy .
As for the new school year , Education Minister Ludwig Spaenle ( CSU ) , at 47 Gymnasia , launched the pilot experiment `` mid-level plus , '' in which an extension of the high school average of three is tested by three to four years - as a result , it will take nine years to go to high school .
But Aiwanger does n't go far enough .
`` The issue of G9 needs to be speeded up , '' the FW chief said .
We call for freedom of choice for all gymnasts who want this .
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired .

JVA Berlin-Tegel : Five square feet of cell are degrading
The Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex-detainee to the law enforcement agency Tegel , which had been housed in a small cell for months .
Because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
According to the judges , they can even hope for money if only a few days were locked up in the confined spaces ( Az . : 1 BvR 1127/14 ) .
As a result , an ex-detainee with his constitutional credentials was successful in Karlsruhe : He was housed in a single cell with around five square feet of ground floor between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was not separated .
After that , the man who is now back at large , according to his lawyer , has been moved to a larger cell .
His oath of office , because of the indecent prison conditions against the country of Berlin , failed .
But the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court , rejecting the case for re-examination .
You see the man 's human dignity being violated .
Chamber court now decides on level of compensation
Even if , for legal reasons , the period in question was only a few days jail days for compensation , compensation was given , it was said .
Otherwise , `` a clergyman of legal protection would be to fear the personality . ''
The chamber court now needs to clarify the amount of money .
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
So they spoke only in April to a detainee compensation because he was naked in a cell .
Degrading , according to a 2011 decision , also the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet .
In addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had documented a detainee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
The then-plaintiff was hospitalized for three months every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
Berlin 's prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of missing staff .
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly trapped for 23 hours , the aggressiveness is rising , even thugs are supposed to have arrived because of the tense situation .
According to the Department of Justice , 21 positions in Tegel are not occupied due to the lack of young people , 19 are due to disappear in 2016 .

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right ball in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven .
While this has brought the left field defender to wine and will rule him out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season .
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw collapsed into the PSV area .
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
Van Gaal said : `` He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital . ''
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
It 's horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it 's very hard and then plays fantastically , and then that happens .
In the dressing room , he had an oxygen mask on .
He was crying .
I 'm not a doctor , but if you have a double fracture , that takes six months and he wo n't play in the group stage .
I hope he can play again this season .
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee , has not punished the Mexicans .
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong .
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
It was a very serious attack with both legs .
A tweet on Shaw 's account said : `` I thank you all for your news , words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . ''
Related : Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England defender , with the European Championship in France , has an additional incentive to recover by next June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV coach , said : `` It 's a very serious injury . ''
When a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
It 's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland-team at the 2014 World Cup .
`` He 's doing very hard because it was n't his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it 's a very serious injury , that 's not good , '' Cocu said .
For me , it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction so it looked as if he [ Moreno ] had touched him , but I could n't see the attack on Luke .
Talking to SBS6 , Moreno said : `` I know how it feels , I know how hard something like this can be .
I feel very bad , and I am so sorry .
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling .

Justin Bieber in the Capital : On Bieber Expedition in Berlin

At present , Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin .
And the generation U17 turns through .
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska .
The 15-year-old has never heard the name `` Ritz Carlton . ''
Not bad .
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday .
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland .
However , since 7 in the morning , the Polin is sitting on the cold stone plates vorm Berlin 's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz .
The Bieber-Bau : Here 's her idol , whose poster hung up in Stettin , since Monday night .

The saying : `` In fact , my Wiktoria would have to sit in the 10th grade in high school . ''
`` I fulfill her a dream . ''
School duty ?
Who juts ?
The fans do n't .
Nor do Bieber himself .
In any case , it has been outspent .
For the promotion in the advertising break of the superhero , he netted three million , a second-year deal with an anti-picket company washed up many , many dollars to the Bieber account .
And with every doll that looks like him and over the counter , Bieber also cashes in .
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee , you 're amazed at the window .
He is said to have captured more than 100 million .
Some say the hype is going too far .
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally just in the US and Britain with his new single `` What do you ? '' at No . 1 .
Bieber himself , whose fourth album is due to follow in November , is not interested in the many zeros .

Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victim of violent crime
A crime suspect has led police to the corpse of the 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday .
In the interrogation , the 20-year-old admitted to killing the youngsters and throwing their corpse into a canal in Rockenhausen .
A 16-year-old born since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
The young woman 's body was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday night , as prosecutors and police said Wednesday .
Another 20-year-old , who was arrested on Tuesday night , was also arrested , according to the statement , and led investigators to the site of the corpse .
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after failing to come home on the eve after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen .
In search of the young woman , investigators initially encountered personal belongings of the victim .
At the time of interviews in the friends and acquaintances of the missing persons , there was a conspiracy against the 20-year-olds .
The alleged perpetrator then led police to a canal in Rockenhausen where the body was found .
The procession admitted to the authorities in the police interrogation , killing the 16-year-old and placing the corpse in the canal .
The 20-year-old was due to be presented to the port judge on Wednesday , and investigators are accused of manslaughter .
Details of the immediate circumstances are expected to bring the further investigation .

Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
The Austrian Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mikltiktner , stated on Tuesday evening at the Austrian television station ORF , that no one will be returned to Hungary .
Germany , too , did not return refugees to Austria .
`` No , that 's so agreed , '' she explained .
On the question of an agreement that Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mikltiktner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
She did not mention specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
In the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so-called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
Their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
The EU countries have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
The EU 's interior ministers want to take a fresh start to the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
Given the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to give more support to countries in the initial acquisition and distribution of people .
The federal government will manage this jointly with the countries , announced by Merkel late Tuesday night after nearly four-hour deliberations with the prime ministers at the chancellor 's office in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would receive it .
But if you do n't have a lead perspective , you can not stay in Germany .
This view was summed up in the round .
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a `` huge effort . ''
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometer long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
A few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that it would also shut down the border with Romania with a fence .
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking evasive routes over Romania , Hungary 's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the proposed new border fence .
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
There were initial arrests of people who had cut the fence .
In Turkey , meanwhile , eyewitness accounts said that thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border .

Pegida poster puts Lebanese on potato döner idea
Potatoes or döner ?
It goes both - in the potato döner , developed by the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay .
Inspired by the phrase `` potato rather than döner '' on a poster of the Pegida movement , Alhay potato and meat put together on a stick .
On the idea , he brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription `` potatoes instead of döner , '' which he had accidentally seen on television .
Since then , there has been a barbecue in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
`` This is Multikulti for the stomach , '' says Alhay .
The idea has now been written by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich .
It has recently been protected as a utility model , according to the authority .
So , how much meat and how much potatoes the cronies contain , Alhay does not want to betray them .
Just so much : `` It tastes better together , '' he finds .
The culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .

Disney plans new `` Mary Poppins '' film
Legends do n't want to stir up , but Disney still dares to a new film of its classic `` Mary Poppins . ''

It 's about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family at a time of the Great Depression in England .
Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear .

Seehofer : 'Borders are not sealed off '
In an extended telephone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer ( CSU ) , state principal Josef Pühringer ( VP ) , on Monday , recorded the further action on the refugee issue .
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
The continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic continues to be possible .
However , there are now the relevant border controls .
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being .
However , the security seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
Of the other member states , Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue .
Now that Austria , too , introduces controls at its borders , is `` a logical consequence '' of the actions of the Germans .

Four-fold increase from intake of hand disinfectants by children in last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400-percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand-disinfectants , according to the Georgia Poison Center .
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , director of the Georgia Poison Center , cases of revenue of hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12 , which report poison control centers , rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014 .
`` Children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are going in the emergency room , '' Lopez told CNN .
He said some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some are doing to impress their friends or because of a mutation in social media .
Videos on YouTube show how young people are disinfectant only because of a cheap experience .
Youths allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic oral water to get a harder drink .
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants .
`` A kid does n't think this is bad for it , '' Lopez said .
Many of the more attractive ( hand-disinfectants ) are those who are parenting .
There are disinfectants with strawberry , grapes and orange duft , which are very appealing to children .
Hanging disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol .
Especially in the case of young children , a few spritzer can lead to alcohol poisoning .
`` It 's highly concentrated alcohol , '' Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the toxic notruf Center at the University of Kansas , told the broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City .
So , you would n't let a sip of whisky go around , but people let these hand disinfectants within reach of children , and when children come to it , it 's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four spritzer from after strawberry flavored hangings in school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult legally considered drunk , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
Nhaijah lopped her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children 's hospital on signs of brain trauma since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head , Ritchey said .
`` It was very frightening , '' Ortoria Scott , Nhaijah 's mother , told CNN .
It could have been fatal for my child .
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand depressants outside the child 's reach .
Beyond alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants were associated with deaths .
In 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
Employees of health officials suspect that the product contained methanol , a lethal solution , rather than ethyl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
In January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their `` gema '' teacher by issuing antibacterial products around the classroom , according to a police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and served them out of her room .
The police regarded the failed plan as `` chatter '' and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority .

Melbourne-Storm-coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals over claims to ring fight
Melbourne-Storm-coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players ' tackling as an `` Agenda setting '' by two Premier League favorites of the NRL .
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the umpires allowed the storm-fielding players to play `` ring battles '' with his team during the High Storm rally in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the storm-team after his team scored the Final-Sieg against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night , calling the game a `` model example '' of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not `` too good '' in wrestling .
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said they were focused only on their `` contact '' at Tackling .
Bellamy added that the criticism from two leading coaches on his team gave him confidence , as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm-team .
`` That keeps coming up - I did n't hear that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when they beat us 24 : 2 , '' Bellamy said Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus , and that has provided the turnaround for us .
Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train , so he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock to him .
It 's funny how this time to come back to this time of year .
Bellamy has attacked Bennett 's idea of `` exciting football '' and reminded his mentor that Bennett 's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with `` boring '' football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday night and how exciting their game was , '' Bellamy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticised as a boring team , and Wayne said he was going to take care of a cockrower .
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
That 's the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players .
He made that statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like this .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us .
Six weeks ago , they probably did n't think of us when it came to the Big Games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS scored a higher score than the game Broncos against Cowboys .
The Broncos ' game was probably a good game , I have n't looked at it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tries in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
Or are breaks , and no points , a bit of tension ?
For me , it 's the game plans .
When they mention us , it means that we are still going to meet them at one stage .
The storm-team has been free this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the preseason finals at AAMI Park , with ticket sales starting next Tuesday morning .

FriendsFest : The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men 's friendship
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove to be at a 15-year high .
In 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
In an effort to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miseruation ( CALM - campaign against a pathetic life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they needed that .
Friendship is at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
A recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with `` healthy mood , '' his chances of recovery doubled .
For those who are not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risks of mental problems .
But , of course , you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
In the age of communication on social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lifelike and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrine values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of inconsolate values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which has a far more profound effect on our mental health .
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained , money really ca n't buy happiness .
The great thing about Friends was that this focus was placed on his head .
Each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , who was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey and Chandler 's frequent hugs , moments at the football look in cozy armchairs and the yearning of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case , even if they are often reluctant to explore entirely their feelings .
As one employee of the telephone teacher explained to me : `` my audience 's role for people who feel depressed and self-morseless , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
The old phrase `` I am coping with it '' has an enormous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems . ''
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term response mechanisms .
It clearly presents the little moments of men 's friendship .
So much my objective outsider status over the phone to people in the eye of despair may also help , the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so if you visit this weekend 's Comedy Central FriendsFest with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day , then why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk .
Or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks , give him a smile and say hello .
You never know what difference your friendship might make .
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest

Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch college newcomer
Nearly two years after a student died during a bullying ritual of a student compound in Pocono Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are filed against five people .
Members of the New York-based Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Brulik attacked Chun `` Michael '' Deng during an introduction session in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , police said .
Officials said he was charged with linked eyes with a 30-pound replica of sand filled with sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches , then fell unconscious .
Members of the Pi-DeltaPsi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became impotent and reportedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital , according to police .
However , they had the time to switch Dengs 's clothing , his symptoms to goose and Andy Meng to contact the Brotherhood 's national president to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference .
`` At this point , members began to hide Utensilien and put the welfare of the Brotherhood fundamentally over that of Michael Deng , '' police chief Wagner said .
He could not be revived , and he died the next morning of his injuries .
According to an autopsy report , Deng repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to head , hull and thigh .
`` Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood ... at least one student has been dying of harassment since 1970 every year , '' said Douglas Fierberg , a lawyer representing Deng 's family , in a statement .
Bruising and its members must be held accountable , and this move by authorities is very important .
A County grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder third-graders for the first five members .
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Meng , are also accused of bullying and forming a criminal association .
`` We do n't just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or inofficially - has sanctioned this , we will also hold them accountable , '' Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday .
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group .

Brazil 's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS is trying to explain to shocking women how important good nutrition is during breastfeeding , and is doing so with the presentation of images of babies sucking to breasts that are painted with depictions of unhealthy food .
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
Due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day .
However , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
A recent study led by Robert Waterland , a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies ' genes and protects them from developing tumors .
Unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system .

4 people killed after police shooting rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people , including a 4-year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said Wednesday .
The violence erupted Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district , about 175 miles west of the capital , Kathmandu .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , resident district officer , said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and firebombs .
MR Dhakal said police used tear gas and then shot in the air before pulling back on rubber bullets .
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used , of which it is known that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal 's southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus , who want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clashes since Oct. 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries .
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .

Serbians with $ 200,000 bail after drug deal
A man who may face a life sentence because of his attempt to get in possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on bail of $ 200,000 .
Marko Maksimovic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay , which came from South America via Vanuatu and lodged in Coomera in August .
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
Despite a possible life sentence for trying to own a commercial quantity of cocaine , Maksimovic 's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason .
The judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flanagan , was concerned about the escape danger at Maksimovic .
He has clear relations with Serbia .
He often travels to Serbia , '' he told the court Wednesday .
In the criminal case , he lied to police about his whereabouts .
Maksimov 's mother and stepfather had offered bail of $ 200,000 as security together to reach his release .
`` After reading the audacious statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of $ 200,000 is a real financial burden , '' Judge Flanagan said .
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from not appearing , he warned .
Maksimovic was released on bail , under the terms that he made his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported to the police daily , and kept to a curfew at 18 : 00-06 : 00 .

Champions League : Baylor 's dream start thanks to Müller and Idol
Two-time goalscorer in Piraeus : Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run .
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran .
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season .
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Idol have given FC Bayern a dream start to the `` Mission Milan '' in the witchbowl of Piraeus .
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their kickoff in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müllers 's double-pack ( 52nd/90+ 2 ) and Idol hits ( 89th ) earned by 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The twelfth star success in the series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardiola will finally bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt .
At his 28th match in the Champions League , Müller received friendly support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto , who made a shot of the world champion as a flanker .
`` We 're not going to underestimate them , '' Baylor captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game at the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31.688 hottest fans - and the Munich held word .
They showed a focused and dedicated idea without shining .
Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the premier class , including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United , Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin .
In 2011 , Borussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stumbled here .
But Bayern , in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated , did not want to be the next victim .
They went boldly , but they were often too unimaginative in their offensive efforts .
The attacks have been launched too often by game shift on left-hander Douglas Costa , who has rarely come through against former Zealand 's Omar Elabdellaoui .
Müller had been more lucky from the right when his flanker slipped out of the right half-field in the left upper gate .
In the 67th minute , the world champion gave up the possible 2 : 0 .
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski .
First , as Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat Poland 's headball from the line ( 26th ) .
Then by direct delivery , the goalkeeper Roberto with his knee pared ( 35 ) .
Although Bayern moved to their usual dominant game , Piraeus was able to set needle sticks .
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer , though , was leaving .
So , for example , when he steered a shot of Ideye over the latte ( 56th ) .
Before Neuer , Guardiola was allowed to defend a four-seater with David Alaba at the centre alongside Jerome Boateng , who made it good .
Mario Idol , after muscular problems back in the caddie , first sat outside .
The World Cup hero was given the green light only after the final training session , said athletic director Matthias Sammer at `` Sky '' : `` Whoever wants to make something different from this is already malignant . ''
Even at the first change , Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the troubled Lewandowski ( 59th ) .
Idols arrived late for Arturo Vidal ( 7-6 ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by Elfmeter , Müller added one more .
Before the game , it was in the stadium to tie .
After a smaller group of partially married Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and walked out with batters against the Munich supporters .
At least one Bayern-Fan was transported out of the stadium .

Why I am witnessing an executive in Oklahoma
A little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see a man being brought to death .
If it happens , and I hope it does n't happen , I will be sitting in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the toxic injection .
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day moved closer , I began to fear .
So why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US , and since there are often more applications than seats available , a macabre lottery will take place to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
Anyone who is selected will watch it emotionally .
I ca n't .
I will sit alongside Richard Glossips 's closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we speak .
The prison authorities say I ca n't be a witness and a journalist , so I wo n't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality .
Here 's the lesson .
Tell the prisoner 's story of how he wants it , and you get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she `` could have put it better , '' but she still thinks it 's wrong what I do .
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
He does n't tell me what I have to write , and I would n't do it even if he was going to do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter present to write there .
If he dies , he thinks the outreach effort will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bellware , a reporter of the Huffington Post , will sit next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts I made .
I do not want to go back to all the details .
I ca n't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed .
But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
And from that perspective , I will see him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters you can turn to .
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of an unnecessary death .

Election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally , but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her on the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 percent previously ) , while Sanders is second , with 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries .
More than five months before the start of the primaries , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support .
But Clinton 's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
Since the CBS News poll , Clinton has lost among a number of demographic groups , while Sanders posted some gains .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates , but these advances have diminished .
Their support among men has fallen significantly , and Sanders is back here only with 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a big lead among older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double-digit lead at the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group .
About half of Democratic voters of the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if nominated by the party .
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate .
Six percent would not support them .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton 's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them .
While 48 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say this about their leading candidate , Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
When Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it 's time that a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Of Clinton 's supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
Consent to deal with the problems and electability are also cited .
As the vice president casts a potential for president in the wake , 57 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries want to see him in the race - although a third believe he should not .
If Democratic voters of the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Biden is at the helm .
Of Clinton 's supporters , more than half say that Biden would be their second choice well before Sanders .
If Biden decides not to run for the Democrats ' nomination , Hillary Clinton 's edge ahead of Sanders , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election ; however , that number has fallen from 78 percent last month .
Biden is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the `` most selective '' has risen .
Still , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about electability .
Like last month , not a single Democratic candidate , or potential candidate , stands out as unacceptable for these voters .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results on some important traits among voters of their party 's primaries .
Majorities regard Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities .
Biden cuts best among the three candidates in terms of honesty , while Clinton 's strength is the lead .
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do n't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say this about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do n't have an opinion of him .
Democratic voters of the primaries generally see Clinton , Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views .
For all these measurements , about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders .
Given questions about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during tenure as secretary of state , most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall .
But it 's a different story in the American public as a whole .
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their statement , while only about a third are satisfied .
Public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on her general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that her opinion of her was still deteriorating .
It 's mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have gotten worse .
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : Only 32 per cent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight per cent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
Sixty-two percent of eligible voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy .
Clinton and Trump , however , receive good marks on leadership .
Of the six candidates tested , Biden , Carson and Bush cut best in honesty .
A majority sees Sanders more than honest , but as with Carson , many have no opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .

Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe holds false speech in parliament
MR Mugabe , Africa 's oldest leader , fell from a podium down the stairs early in the year .
He remained unharmed , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
The opening of Parliament was also clouded by allegations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mugabe 's address with Buhrott .
Last month , they had ousted him and interrupted him during his speech to the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he reiterated on Tuesday .
The spokesman for the movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - MDC ) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which warned them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe 's speech .
`` The news comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title 'death ' , '' he told journalists after Mugabe 's speech .
It warns the concerned MPs that immunity ends in parliament , and once they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was `` concerned '' about the dangers to politicians .

That Viktor Orbán now sends more Zigthousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has made a high official and public opinion of the Hungarian Government 's position in the Dunstkreis of Nazism .
As a result of this policy , it is not only the Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas .
The birds , too , will have to find that the `` promised land , '' which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp .
It will be a major challenge , given the continuing influx of refugees and the approaching winter , in order to create decent conditions for those seeking protection .
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .

Europe 's refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and ripped off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , holding all the firm trying to get into the country illegally , all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants .
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man 's land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
The people who fled violence were stranded for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
But frustrations rose .
When a police helicopter hovered over them , the migrants `` opened the border ! '' and shouted insults against Hungarian riot police .
Some pointed out food and water in protest .
Serbia 's foreign minister said it was `` unacceptable '' that migrants would be sent back from Hungary , while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution rather than collateral damage .
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , '' said Ivica Dacic in Prague .
The turmoil on the ungarish-Serb border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
However , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who took refuge in the overridden Italy and Greece , and they expressed their hope that , next month or until the end of the year , an agreement would be reached that the EU states would include an additional 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent 's immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on early action from Brussels or its neighbours .
Tuesday 's emergency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto , meanwhile , said that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
In recent months , Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and has become the gateway to the European Union .
However , Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants who are looking for a better life , not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states , including Germany .
The new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4-metre ( 13 foot ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime .
`` Due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , '' government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
We say it very clearly : Illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament must still agree to the military 's use of the military , which is expected for next week , but reporters told Associated Press on the border there were heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already seen for days .
Gyorgy Bakondi , land security adviser for Orban , said that authorities told 45 people in trying to cross the border , 15 others had already invaded the country .
They come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws .
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train truck collided with barbed wire to close the borders .
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people 's data and pressed a crowd to get there .
About 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link from Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary .

FedEx earnings mixed , financial prospects cut for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its profit outlook to a full year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service .
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
At this time last year , FedEx announced that the company would want to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening Wednesday .
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May , 20 cents less than in the earlier forecast .
Analysts expected $ 10.84 , according to a survey by FactSet .
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases , which are an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages that will be charged from November .
The company said that it nevertheless expects earnings to rise above the previous year due to cost-cutting , higher revenue and because of growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company `` provides solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . ''
Plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS , which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
In the quarter that ended August 31 , FedEx earned $ 692 million , 6 percent more than last year .
Earnings per share amounted to $ 2.42 per share , just below the $ 2.44 per share that 12 of Zacks Investment Research analysts predicted .
Sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.3 billion .
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $ 12.23 billion .
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments in recent years , which brought sales in its unit Express shipments to the stash .
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground .
In the last quarter , sales at ground sports rose 29 percent , but operating income was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance .
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings decreased due to higher labor costs in the cargo business .
In premarket trading , about an hour before the opening , FedEx shares fell $ 3.85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 150.15 .
On Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .

Ben Carson moves to nationwide poll close behind Donald Trump
Ben Carson is in the latest poll from CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now account for half of the support of voters in the new poll , and others lose dramatically to stop
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide , with support growing from 23 % in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month , up 27 % in Tuesday 's poll .
But Carson shot up from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
The survey also found that Carson does well at demographic groups and surpasses Trump among Republican voters with higher education .
The rest of the field , with the exception of Carly Fiorina and compatriot Governor John Kasich , is cut off with Wis . Governor Scott Walker , who has fallen to the deepest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush , the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida-Senator Marco Rubio are up with 6 % in third place .
The error margin at the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he lands at 19 % support among Republicans , behind the Trump with 32 % support .
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson .
With a view to one in last week 's Carson , Trump found some sideshots for the former neurosurgeon , even after Carson apologized for questioning Trumps 's faith .
`` We need energy , '' Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa .

In an emergency call , Professor admits to having his girlfriend shot
In an emergency call , Professor Shannon Lamb told a slightly scratchy voice of police that he shot his girlfriend and that officers would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his `` sweet dog '' was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
Inside the house , officers found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was glued to a white block : `` I am so sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , '' which was in the letter , according to the authorities , and he was signed by Lamb .
There was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10 : 18 p.m .
He said that Lamb made the fatal distress call sometime afterwards .
By the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when police raided him .
A day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors , authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
Students said they were freaking out on his lessons .
Police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the `` wonderful people '' with whom he shared his academic life .
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
At the same time , there were some incumbents to problematic behavior .
One student , Brandon Beavers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little upset and nervous , `` as if something was wrong with him . ''
Another student , Mikel Sykes , said that lamb told him he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15 .
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for an assessment on health grounds , saying that he had any health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
The latest changes in the university 's employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not give him a guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor .
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course there was something in Mr Lambs 's idea . ''
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
After fleeing from campus , police later found Lambs lane when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents ' home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson .
His car still ran in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 residents and taught geography and pedagogy .
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring .
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game .
He was the women 's swarm at the time .
All the girls melted away when he was there , '' said Hairston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident .
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together .
In the emergency call , Lamb said `` I killed my wife , '' but there was no certificate from a marriage .
They had a dog called Lightning , who lived with them in the Backstein house , bordering on a Bayou in Gautier .
Police said the dog was OK .
Prentiss 's ex-husband , Shawn O'Steen , said they were divorced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
`` She was totally destroyed on the ground , '' O'Steen said about his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O'Steen said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer vintage market three years ago .
Later , they played together the one or another Gig .
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Shaffer , a Barker and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a weakly lit bar near Gautier , said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time , after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmonicaspiel finished in front of a sparse crowd .
There were no signs that anything was wrong .
`` Just a happy couple , '' he said .
We were on cleaning up and joking at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester training program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty , staff , students and members of the community attended a candlelight commemoration .
Schmidt 's wife , Liz , and his brother , Jeff Schmidt , also attended the memorial station , while the University-schor `` Bright Morning Star '' and `` Amazing Grace '' sang .
Classes will resume on Wednesday .
`` We 're trying to move our students to return , '' LaForge said .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Prentiss was called his wife , but there was no indication that the two were ever married .

Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It 's a mix of very big fashion show and a wax figurehead : The designer Jean Paul Gaultier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
The highlights : Storefront pucks , which are alarmingly human thanks to video projections .
They wear the French designer 's spectacular creations , among others , with Madonnas stage outfits to the great star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in skirts .
`` I ca n't say today that I 'm the Enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair . ''
`` Before it was tanned , now it 's real , '' Gaultier said .
For the visitors to the exhibition `` From the Sidewalk To The Catwalk '' ( From the pavement on the catwalk ) , which can be seen from 18 September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his first negative attitude to a show about his person .
Actually , he was against it , because : `` For me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , '' he said .
When you die , you come to the museum .
The impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
`` It 's about so much more than just beautiful clothes , '' said the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Diederen .
It is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education .
Chronologically , the show is not built , but it is a superbly choreographed overall artwork , for which a lot of effort was done : To frisk the dolls , for example , a stylist was dedicated .
14 tons of material have been mated by the makers , according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich .
Just before the start of the October festival there was a special treat : A leather chair outfit with corset .
Heidi meets Madonna .
He has always been interested in strong women ( `` women are smarter than men '' ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaultier said .
Gaultier 's old teddy is also seen in the exhibition .
He stands for the designer 's first , tentative fashionable walking attempts .
As a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his teddy BHs and clothes , Gaultier said .
With a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
Throwing fashion , he later confessed himself to himself .
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gaultier said in Munich .
Later , however , I bought it , then , of course .
For his first own fashion show , he has not been able to pay the models .
They did n't get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clams .

FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand before the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and , given his history , his involvement next summer at the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
The great shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had finished strong last season after a separate ankle injury and then recovered to his old swing during the pre-season .
`` This kind of injury does n't threaten the career , '' Wenger said .
It 's a bone that does n't heal well .
This is not a bigger issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not in touch with his ankles or with the injuries he had before .
That may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wenger also acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
It is also developing an unpleasant pattern .
The investigation by Premier Hospital Ltd recorded 23 different conditions of Wilshere since its debut six years ago .
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal 's 157 league games in the last five seasons .
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 , which has recorded the most injury days .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe an improvement in the injury rate will continue during last season .
`` Sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prospective period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , '' Wenger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabilises , I 'm confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday , and Wenger faces a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start .
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
`` I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little breather , '' Wenger said .
Although Arsenal are clear favourites , passing through Group F , the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe .
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the `` invincible '' campaign was launched last season .
The stadium was struck by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale .
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes Arsenal have drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '' Wenger said .
It has never worked out at Arsenal .
We were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I 'm long enough in the business to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .

Muslims buried in Mecca at crane accident - Bin Laden 's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia settles the collapse in part of the giant Saudic Bin-Ladel group
The Department of Health said that , in addition , a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mekka 's big moshee .
Mourners filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead joined their last trip to the Al-Moaissem-cemetery .
The funeral procession moved past the Holy See , where only days before a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the bedside .
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction over the building company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 394 injured .
The bodies of 29 mourners who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mozhee Mekkas were carried through the streets .
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was assisted .
MR Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsh in the Great Mosque .
Saudi officials have already agreed that the Haddsh will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
Today , King Salman said the Bin-Ladel group should not have stood the arm of the crane when it was not used .
An Arab version of the decree , published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin-Ladel Group was partly responsible for the collapse .
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the company 's leadership was banned from traveling abroad .
Earlier this week , Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the big mozhee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddsh , which takes place later this month .
The Bin-Ladel Group did not issue statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment .
The Royal Decree also tamed the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists .
Dozens of crows surrounded Mekka 's big moshee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin-Ladel Group .
The Bin Laden family has been affiliated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes on larger construction projects .
The late leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a breakaway son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s .
The crane 's crash came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim .
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital .
Government officials ordered that 1 million rial ( £174,000 ) to be paid to the families of those killed and the same amount of permanent casualties .
Other injuries get half that amount .

Metcash launches ground level campaign to fight Ald . incursion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches ahead of an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia .
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million Aldi invasion .
During Aldi 's opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adelaideshow .
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eishmaker Simmo from Dunsborough , distributed in IGA stores , and shopkeepers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholesaler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 per cent of Metcash 's IGA-Lade stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash 's IGA network in eastern states .
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in eastern states .
However , analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will snap out around five per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first markets , and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
According to a report published this week , analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million in sales per year and metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , and will achieve sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities at Metcash 's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr Kierath said .
At the same time , Metcash is losing market share in eastern states , mainly to Aldi and Coles , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley is assuming that Metcash 's sales in the food and food business are down 3.8 per cent in 2016 , down 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass , the founder of the Magellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass 's comments .
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week .
IGAS 's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and income from Metcash 's food and grocery store , which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
However , the wholesaler wrestles and invests more than $ 150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by rapidly growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private-Label food .
Metcash 's chief executive , Ian Morrice , says that the price adjustments and shoplifting programs will go to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .

Archaeologists collide at Cologne 's Rhine on leftovers from late antiquity
At the same time , archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard , archaeologists of the Römisch-Germanic Museum have dug out skeletons and remnants of historic buildings , museum director Marcus Trier said Tuesday .

The crowd makes it : Every two years , the automakers on the IAA show their novelties .
In 2015 , there is mainly movement in the compact cars , which are currently selling particularly well .
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand : Around 28.1 per cent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone , according to the Motor Office ( KBA ) .
This is also reflected on the IAA ( publication date 17 to 27 September ) .
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at retailers in the autumn .
`` The Astra is an extremely important model for us , '' Opel chief executive Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair .
He belongs to the core of the brand .
In order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive for this .
Opel represents an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros .
The Astra comes with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp .
In addition , the Hesse offers further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 horsepower , to which , for the first time , there are also three-cylinder liners .
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is first only as a fifth stunner .
A second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi , which can also be seen on the IAA .
And what is going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA ?
Renault Mégane : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra-competitor Mégane into the race .
At the trade fair , the Mégane is to be seen exclusively as a fifth man in a conventional and an impressive sporting GT-version .
In trade , he arrives early next year , then also as a combi .
Infiniti : Quite new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30 .
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model .
The compact Infiniti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand 's design line .
The base model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp .
However , there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 horsepower .
Suzuki Baleno : New in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
The model is offered with petrol engines , including a newly developed 1.0litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp .
The maximum torque is based on the manufacturer 's data at 170 newtonmeters ( Nm ) .
The sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : Not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen on the IAA .
On the outside , the designers of the noble Citroën-Ablegers were mainly hand in front of the front section : Here the fridge was redrawn and the changed headlights fitted with LED technology .
In the interior , the infotainment system was modernized , reducing the number of buttons through a touch screen and integrated Apple 's CarPlay for the first time .
In addition , at the IAA in the compact class , a series of revisions and new variants such as the frozen Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI .

Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold-plated ) Dornenkrone is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent images .
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
His `` language '' with colourful colours and imaginative forms has received the 75-year-old - but in no way synonymous with `` funny '' pictures .
On the contrary : Adapted to the respective subjects , that can be quite bleak .
For about three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project , for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the `` Book of all books . ''
There have been cycles that address themes such as cross paths , pranks , bids , or fatherhood .
In doing so , he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : This applies to the Lutheran publisher with its theological orientation as well as to Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
And there is , above all , the author Klaus Altepost , who has worked on the basis of painting with the respective Bible papers .
He has interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into the current context .
These lyrics are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting .
They are embedded between the original Bible treadmill by Martin Luther and a set of the artist who puts his own personal thoughts on the situation .
The jewellery band has Golden Letters .
So the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high level of intimacy .
Emotions were ultimately triggered by the Bible project : Otmar Alt , born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant missionary .
`` Because the education was already done with the cane , '' Otmar Alt recalls .
`` I tried to work that out to help me cope again with the Lord 's father . ''
His second concern is to regain the importance of art at the fastest time : `` The perception of image worlds is characterised by advertising today , and that is loud .
Symbolism is being squeezed out there .
Artists have a different desire and cheek to show things .
Pictures always have something secretive and are not decorative .
`` In this respect , I 'm a dinosaur . ''
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to `` fall in '' the images , let them look at them , discover and feel the power they have : `` The image is looking for its counterpart . ''
Klaus Altepost acknowledged Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Old Foundation , `` always '' a lover of Otmar Alts art : `` I like how he understands life with his paintings . ''
Old did not care to fully capture the Bible , but chose the most important , also mysterious themes .
`` This was not cooperation on an equal footing , '' says Altepost : `` Here we are talking about the images , the text merely explains , '' a picture Bible was created .
For Hans Möhler from Lutheran Verlag , this work is an invitation to `` deepen his life and find freedom . ''
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that opens at the Otmar-old Foundation on November 15 .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felenstausen .
We are also pleased to welcome Sammy 's Mayor Bernd Bormann , Business Development in Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert .
In many places in the country , doctors - Asendorf , on the other hand , are lucky : On 1 October , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fellowship .
While Ursel Felenstausen is retiring , her husband , Karl-Heinrich , will face his successor in the next few months with half a point .
After a remodeling period , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he invests 310000 euros into the premises at St Marcellus Road 6 .
There was a great deal of sympathy at first sight , when , before years Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll , met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll , who , for the time being , complete their medical education at the Hospital in Vermont and will also be able to enter into practice at the end of the year .
`` We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice , '' says Dr. Ursel Felenstausen and laughs .
`` When it was up , I just called them . ''
Mrs Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in Asendorf in the future .
`` The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , '' says the 39-year-old Müller .
`` We would like to meet and accompany the families over the years . ''
As an advantage , he also sees himself soon to be his own boss .
And so it was agreed , the dumpers bought the house with the practice .
However , they will continue to live in fracture Vilsen .
There , the two-time family friend , Frank Müller , also grew up , his medical school in Hanover , followed by stations in several doctors ' practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen , Nienburg and Rotenburg .
At present , he works as a senior doctor in Sulingen , and in 2009 he was ordered to become a chief medical doctor in Diepholz County , and is a volunteer in the DRK-readiness fault house Vilsen .
As of September 19 , the practice is being prepared for the new boss .
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felenstausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ursel ( internist ) has specialized in gastroenterology .
The Müllers , both internists , want to settle as family doctors .
`` Endoscopy is coming out , '' says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll .
After the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and stress EKGs and need a talk room more .
In addition , the IT system is completely renewed .
A grant of a total of EUR 50000 will receive the Müllers within the framework of a grant program from the county ( 25000 euros ) as well as from the Samtcommunity ( 12500 euros ) and the community ( $ 12500 ) .
`` This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice continues , '' notes Samtpublic 's chief executive Bernd Bormann .
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll , about 2,000 patients come to the practice field for every quarter , in the North German average practice , it is about 500 .
There is another doctor 's practice in Asendorf .
A positive side effect of the practical assumption by Frank Müller : The pharmacy remains in Asendorf , according to Ursel Felenstausen .
If no successor had been found , she would have gone , too .
Anyone who visits Müller 's speaking time will continue to look , in particular , in familiar faces : Take over the seven medical workers and the cleaners from the field .
With their departure in Asendorf , an era , after all , doctors practiced there for 30 years .
`` At the beginning we only had two rooms , '' Ursel Felenstausen shouted .
A little grumpy , after a long period of time , they have fallen .
`` But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients still often , '' the internist says .
Her husband added laughing : `` We have a 6000-square-foot plot . ''
`` So far , I 've always pushed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . ''
In addition , the couple have two grandchildren and are happy to travel .

Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by the president of Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and , according to the president of the Australian Tennis Federation , Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo , repeatedly referred to as `` Special Ks , '' came under the spotlight by the infamous clash of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters .
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon afterward , Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee , with Harrison called out : `` Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios and I should beat the kid . ''
While he was last seen as he smashed a tennis bat after a cramp failed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Groth to take second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup semi-final against Britain .
`` One thing about which I 'm quite concerned about it is the fact that after I think Thanasi was drawn a little into the dispute , '' Healy said .
He has broken a racket when he lost because of a cramp in the US Open , but he is not the first player to have broken a racket out of frustration with himself , and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , really , he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open , even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
He 's got a great team around , he 's got a great family around , and I think he 's been treated a little too strictly .
He 's a very mature 19-year-old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in the locker room , he 's trained hard , he 's good in form , he 's a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the `` joint decision '' as the right one for everyone , but he secures the man from Canberra as a long-term fixture to return to the team . ''
`` First , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies surrounding [ Kyrgios ] , '' Healy said .
And I think that , in the eyes of the people like Federer and Murray , he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we are trying to support him , we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions , some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .

`` It 's impossible that everyone can come to Europe '' - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not include all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East .
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
He demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
He also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable , but the situation was not appropriate .
`` It 's impossible that everyone can come to Europe , '' he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany 's and Austria 's efforts to address the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
`` To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long-term solutions , like a real peace and real development , mainly through education , to be created for these Muslim countries , '' he insisted .
Ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
We must reduce the use of force .
`` The use of force has never solved these problems , '' he added .
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence , and also commented on George Bush 's actions after the terrorist attack on Sept. 11 and turned out that the U.S. 's violent response drew a chain of uncontrollable events .
After 11 September , I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence .
`` I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , '' the Dalai Lama said .

Refugees need shelter : Study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense .
More and more refugees are seeking an affordable lead .
The pressure on the housing market is growing .
Social housing is facing a challenge .
Distribution campaigns in the German housing market have long since begun .
With the coming refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities .
They compete with low-income citizens around the last affordable homes .
To meet demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association of `` social-housing . ''
By comparison , this year , 260,000 units are ready in Germany .
As a result , 140,000 homes are missing .
After the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial residence .
Many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long snakes in front of the rental flats .
According to the Federal Statistical Office , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
However , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees .
The study also makes significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting down a housing deficit , which is increasing from year to year .
Currently , some 77,000 accommodation units have already been missing in the conurbations , complains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
Many professionals lived in WG rooms in large cities .
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the `` Hotel Mama '' because of the slack in the housing market .
In the big cities , the number of square feet per capita has declined for the first time in recent years .
To solve the problem , the alliance `` Social Housing '' suggests a reboot .
In doing so , new incentives are expected to boost social housing .
Thus , the basic income tax could be waived and the land tax for subsidised homes will be suspended .
Moreover , according to the Alliance , attractive tax incentives are needed .
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the state bank KfW is already doing well in towns and cities .
A good week after it was launched on Monday evening with EUR 184 million , more than half of the EUR 300 million available had been called up .
Now , the project could even be topped up .

Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to end the racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
He targeted the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment , the final straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what was best for racing and he was finding himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt tuck test at Lidaris , which he can not explain .
He had been restrained for 18 months because of the espionage charges and did not want it to `` look like high-hanging grapes . ''
`` I had nothing to say about this and I 've sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you 're so frustrated that everything comes out at once , '' Moody said .
You know that it went on .
Sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I 'll go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk down the main street , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
If they start thinking I do n't , then I should n't be more coaches .
I then have to consider what I do with my license .
Earlier , Moody had ramped up the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on its stall .
`` Twenty months ago , Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I was asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables , '' Moody said at Racing.com .
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster .
If that is the case , they should certainly catch their noses because they have failed in trying to catch me .
Robert Roulette , chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of the RVL , were aware of this at the time , and are still today .
Should this make me think that it will be personal ?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people outside trainers responsible for what 's going on in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I so bad for the industry ?
Maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
Maybe they 'll have to take my license and violate me , and I have no doubt that what I 'm saying , they 're now thinking about it .
But I 've now got to the point where I do n't care , and that makes me sad .
That makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The coach 's frustration levels have been set up with the long-running Kobalt investigation at Lidari , and the Late Scratching led to the fact that he said he `` could throw his license across the table . ''
Moody , best known by his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar , called the race day treatment rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horseman , which violated the rules .
`` It 's against the rules of racing .
I have to take full responsibility for that , '' he said .
`` One of my staff mistakenly applied mud to the leg .
It could have been last night .
It could have been the whole day the whole day , which was the way it was .
But it also had it so on race day .
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day , an investigation into this matter has been opened .
It 's a joke .
People who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
`` We all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , '' Moody said .

This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
An interest rate rise is coming , and the domestic bill will falter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
We know that .
What we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will last .
In particular , history provides little guidance for the economy .
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and took 86 months .
The Federal Reserve 's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial assets react .
As a result , representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normalisation .
In fact , several variables play a role .
In the end , however , market participants might find that all the fuss about a rate hike may have been exaggerated .
`` The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of `` cheap money , '' '' said Julian Jessop , chief economist at Capital Economics , in a note to clients .
By contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
However , that does not mean there will be no impact .
Here 's a look based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy might react :
As the market has seen last month , the anticipation of interest-rate hikes can make things more volatile for a while .
Once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
`` There appears to be a tendency for asset sales to abate 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , '' said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed 's rate hikes .
More accurately , the market in the past 35 years has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent , according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll , chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , at Barron 's .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the rate of return will begin to decrease .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but interest-rate hikes often encourage them .
In the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
What is most remarkable here is that gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in a Fed rate hike .
According to Deutsche Bank , at the rate of 118 interest rates since 1950 , only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 % .
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 per cent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed .
Interest-rate hikes on such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of `` whether it 's different this time , '' Deutsche Bank said .
Market participants have been caught on an interest-rate hike by the Fed all year , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session , futures trading gives only a 25 percent probability .
`` In our study , all increase in the rate of growth from 1950 to present in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre-receptacles very quickly after the start of the recovery , '' the report concluded .
By contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
Fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in equities if they change their strategic course .
On bonds , the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction takes place in the cycle .
At the end of the increase cycle , bond yields fall immediately , Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Schwab 's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds to be closer together and lead to a draining of the curve .
High-interest bonds often yield better returns in such a climate , though `` we are still cautious about expecting higher yields , '' said Kathy Jones , fixed-income analyst at Schwab , in an analysis .
It is interesting , according to Jones , that markets have already adjusted to Fed-strategy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , '' she wrote .
Short-term interest rates have risen , the earning curve is flat , credit ratings have expanded and volatility has risen - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy .
At large , companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market , as well as financing their debt .
`` History shows that `` quality '' shares tend to react exceedingly positively three months after an initial rate hike , '' Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the customers .
Companies with a strong balance sheet have surpassed companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , averaging 5 percentage points .
Companies with high capital yields as well as low volatility in their shares also transferred their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debt is going to be a big problem .
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Goldman said .
Outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
Savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts disagree on how quickly that will take place .

Lia-Peroni-holder opened second business in the arcade
In the new shop , Furla-handbags are at the centre .
In fact , Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog .
This project had to be curled up by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the dog-market arcade : After all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business local .
At the Furla-Shop opposite the business in which it sells bags , suitcases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , it is now all about women 's handbags of the Furla brand , money markets are from 75 euros .
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
It has been rebuilt for several weeks .
`` I have long considered , however , whether I should still open a store , '' says Breit .
The key to the decision was , among other things , that the Furla producers , who are at home in Bologna , were taken away from the idea of their own location , where only their handbags were sold .
`` We are the only ones in the greater Linz that sell this brand , '' says the mother of two daughters , who himself has Italian roots .
Her fashion interest has received Breit from her mother in the cradle .
I get the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
Why some women find themselves at the sight of a nice handbag in adornment , the specialist woman can not answer with the last safety .
Maybe it 's because a nice bag of every outfit looks up .

Stock market hackers : Ukrainians pay $ 30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly providing insight into yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Marketwired and PR Newswire .
With the exploited information , insider trades should have been made in financial markets .
That way , investigators totaled more than $ 100 million .

The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose residents are called solicitors .
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
Whether he expresses xenophobic , journalists are concerned about or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency is cracking down on the campaign .
And performs well .
This is also registered in the bearded Kallstadt , where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from .
The New Yorker with the conciliatory is many in the Winzerdorf on the wine road .
Some in the 1200-square-foot place is over -ten corners with him .
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate : Donald Trump , here in campaign mode .
Kalltown 's Simone Wendel turned a film about Trump .
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I think this is somehow exciting , but they are not so impressed in their Kallstadter style , '' says Simone Wendel .
The native Kalltown has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprinters , to which alongside Trump also counts the Ketchup family Heinz .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , is also coming to terms in `` Kings of Kallstadt '' ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he were to live in Kallstadt .
To the king of hearts , he did n't bring it there .
While there is respect for the family 's performance , they also tend to believe that Trump is `` already a bit of a big maul , '' Wendel says .
Coincidentally loud the nickname , the Kallstadt in the perimeter , `` The Brulljesmacher '' - to high German : The Angers , she says .
So Trump is coming out of the village of the solicitors .
The Trump 's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold diggers in the US .
Foundations of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York .
But the lives of the grandparents were not free of tragedy : Their desire to return to the homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Palatinate belonged at the time .
He did not include Trump because he was once held off without a permit , the director of the Institute for Forgotten History and Folk , Roland Paul , said at the film launch .
Trump is the grandson of an `` illegal immigrant . ''
This contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descendant .
It had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
`` Like the pole , this is not so sympathetic , '' says Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant relative of Trumps ( `` The grandma was a born Trump , the grandpa was born Heinz '' ) .
The grower , in retirement , looks more distanced from the Americans , `` he 's always so upbeat . ''
Does he think Trump is coming ?
`` I ca n't imagine that , '' says the 72-year-old .
`` He never bothered about Kallstadt . ''
The pension owner Veronika Schramm , like some Kallstadter , mentioned that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something to the church organ during a visit , which is generally good .
`` I ca n't imagine that from Donald , '' the 68-year-old says .
It would be better if he did not contest the election , because `` who has such radical views , I do n't know if that 's good . ''
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the US had been like him , `` he would never have arrived there . ''
`` There are more interesting issues than him , '' says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler .
And as president ?
`` My president is n't , '' she says .
And , `` the grapes will also be ripe without the President Trump . ''
Wendel 's film , for which Trump has long been interviewed , has seen 12 000 cinematographers , including in the US wakes up interest .

Glencore collects $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
The mining giant Glencore , based in Switzerland , which is hit by one-day commodity prices , raised $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt-reduction plan .
London registered company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt .
The company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices as China 's economic downturn hits demand and wreaks havoc on markets .
The issue of subscription rights brought down Glencore 's share price at trading early Wednesday morning , a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
The stock jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index , which opened 0.69 per cent higher .
Glencore last week announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to pay off about a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
The company sold the new holdings to 125 pence per share , representing a 2.4-percent discount on Tuesday 's closing price .
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 per cent of the group .
Concerns about long-term depressed growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have dropped by 20 to 40 percent .

XI urged to open the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open more broadly to the outside world to promote growth , President Xi Jinping said Tuesday of a group tasked with steering reform .
`` China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving the strategies for business start-ups , '' he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central leadership group for deepening a comprehensive reform .
Encouraging new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , Xi said .
The leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border control policies , support the state-owned enterprises ( SOE ) , to borrow private capital , and overhaul the single-person reporting system .
According to the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
The initiative is significant because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources , ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
The government will also loosen controls over the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
As part of a bid to open state-controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
`` The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them , '' the statement said .
In addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the `` Green Card '' by optimising the requirements and making the application process easier .
Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosecutors , was also discussed at a meeting .
The meeting also included Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .

Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it 's official : After reworking at the FuchsparkStadium , the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-seeded Würzburger Kickers has not yet been set , the 6th of October has been set as the date .
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth leg of the Bavarian football Totopokals against the third party FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized .
It will be played on Tuesday , October 6 , at 7 p.m. at the Bamberger FuchsparkStadium .

Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep !
The ads shameful Britain 's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Messenger video watch .
Terrible mob drones !
Footballing shattered blizzards !
Cluster bombs !
And electric shock rods that cause agonizing pain but leave no trace !
The happy voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world 's biggest arms trade fair is a combative parody , produced by Amnesty International , to lobby the British government 's willingness to put weapons to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London 's Docklands .

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains and which require a second look .
`` Important announcement : Drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR ? '' ( Docklands Light Railway ) reads in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLRLine , which converts to the image of a tank .
In September , a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR will ask customers to help stop the arms trade .
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the museum for gruesome designs in Banksys Dismaland .
A collective with the name Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used `` Ad Space Hack Packs , '' a £6 pack from Inbusturnkey , which claims that `` access to around a third of bus station advertising space on the planet . ''
Transport for London finds this poster `` vandalism '' not funny .
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group .
After Gavin Grindon , curator of Crueol Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries .
Many artists work with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to move outside to the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
Another of the anti-gun tape posters greeting the commuters on the subway .
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , which works non-profit with the graphic designer and Voiceover artist who also works for free .
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence that reigned around advertising for the arms trade fair - through a vacancy of the ExCeL-calendar - and thought : `` give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . ''
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertisement , but `` through the concussion with bright colors and animation , it stays stronger . ''
`` They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal resale devices at the fair , '' says Tom Davies of Amnesty .
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not acting illegally on our doorstep .
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL , where exhibitors are scouring fantastically euphemistic products .
In a press release , Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army over `` the AT4CS RS . ''
This includes a `` uniquely formed battlefield head that delivers outstanding follow-up effects inside the target . ''

Eight golden rules for life in student homes
Eleven years ago , I moved as a self-forgotten 19-year-old to a student residence , still in faith in Berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I was annoyed - and to the numerous , long-suffering complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules .
The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nerve-wracking up to absolutely terrifying .
It 's tempting to smile : People tell you where you come from , whether and where you 've taken Sabbath year , where you are in reference to Corbyn and why you `` honestly have Marmite neither love nor hate , because in earnest , guys , it 's just a yeast extract hahaha , I 'm in my room . ''
Breathe through .
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
It distracts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like , unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers .
Leave people .
People 's rooms are often transformed into beverage recipes , film night venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people put themselves in and turn their underwear .
Related : Do n't think about starting at university with a relationship
Introverts received rough treatment at the university .
Your room should be a refuge , but many student homes form a space shuttle culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship .
That can be hell for someone trying to recover .
Nothing in culture allows you to say , `` I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so I get the energy I used to interact with you . ''
Try to feel when a commitone of conviviality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking .
Speaking to knock on : Do it .
One guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Friendship close by baking .
As you start the university at the peak of the Back-mania , the Klopfen is on the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies , less strange than greeting the 1950-year-old `` Welcome to the neighborhood , I 've baked something to you , so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . ''
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
Her fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and , in the end , perhaps associate your face with a tasty surprise .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
Badly missing clumps of flour , sugar and fat mean that people are sleeping when you knock .
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes .
Of course , the clawing of chicken is a theft , but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
Check that with the milk owner .
The odds are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside .
If someone steals your stuff , that 's annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my co-workers , who added their milk a sink to punish thieves .
She is now in prison .
They should not make noise that prevents people from sleep or from work .
It 's not just about being a decent person , but that in the truest sense of the word you belong to the people sitting in the glass house .
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors whether it made them feel a little quieter , drum & bass , because it was three o'clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
They responded with even more tepid music .
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m. , they kindly allowed their neighbours to sleep two hours before crashing their own music , closed their door and went to their three-hour test .
Would n't it be romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same student residence ?
Conversely , would n't it be abysmal embarrassing if you keep a co-worker for your future spouse , ranting at her , rebounding herself and then seeing her every day and perhaps witnessing how she wanders all common friends ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co-worker definitely is n't your future spouse , try at least to give your underbelly a little sanity .
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room , the border between an Ulk and bullying is finer than it seems .
A good stint is funny , but it only takes moments before he becomes a boomerang .
Teach by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but do n't look at someone 's room with toothpaste and shampoo .
Shut her door , and put her keys in a glass of water , which then put you in the freezer - but punches her possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .

Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The local councillor Bernried approved the construction application for the EUR 2.3 million sports hall .
And he made an exception .
The roof may be flat for solar panels .
The plans for the long-awaited turnaround construction at the Bernrieder Sports Area are moving forward step by step : In the recent local council meeting , the prepared construction application was unanimously approved without much discussion .
Previously , the panel had decided , among other things , a request for a construction legal `` exemption '' from the current development plan .
In the case of the `` exception , '' permission was granted for a special form in relation to roof construction .
Thus , a `` saddle-roof with non-common first and roof stand '' is to be built .
Background of planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar panels : `` By doing this we get a wonderfully large southern roof together , '' Mayor Josef Steigenberger said in the meeting .
For the sake of `` liberation , '' it was supposed to be among ten degrees , for energetic reasons , other than in the development plan .
The volume of the hall will be significantly reduced .
A `` liberation '' was necessary because the development plan for the roof of the roof does not allow for `` exceptions '' - with the Bernrieder council usually more restrictive in the case of libertarians .
At Turnbull building , however , it is not a recurring project : `` We do n't create a precedent , '' according to Steigenberger .
The gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bernried .
Around 2.3 million euros are calculated at a cost .
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports support .
In the next step of the procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the Landratet for examination .

Pound rises by accelerating wage growth in the UK
The pound rose briskly after data showing a rise in the UK 's wage growth , while at the same time the FTSE 100 was boosted by bidding at SABMiller .
Between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.9 % over the same period last year .
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and made assessments on the timing of an interest rate increase .

The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49 % to 6,229.21 .

Jewellery rather than Gardine - chatter top as fashion niche
It used to be on the long embroidery machines in and around talking about making meters .
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , for example , to distribute them to blankets and curtains .
This alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Reinhardt , Managing Director of Modespenter .
Instead , fashion is important again .
In the early days of the talking tip , fashion played a bigger role , then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt mentions some examples : Tip in jewelry , with accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
At all , the so-called vintage fashion , which appeals to past Stilepochen , is an increase in order potential .
Those who do not use niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
With us , they already account for half of all orders .
Together with nine other companies , Modespende is a member of the industry association of Plauener Top and Stickereien .
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
Some 80 per cent of sales have been broken in the last 15 years .
Private trade deals , as well as the wholesale trade , almost no longer exist .
Our products hardly reach customers in this way .
The bulk goods are made much cheaper in Asia today and almost exclusively distributed via chains .
Moreover , exports are weakening , according to Russia and the US .
So there are enough reasons for new paths .
The industry association is also trying to score through environmental awareness , as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein : `` Since this year we have been conducting a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable . ''
Reinhardt added : `` This also refers to the materials used . ''
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg outsider of the Westphalian University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroideries and tips .
To counter the competition from Asia , you need to find high-quality and innovative products .
That takes time and courage .
There is an area of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that , above all , have to think economically , '' says Schmidt .
Therefore , an existing design is often slightly different to keep a customer base .
A few years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball .
In some places , the machine stifles small kisses .
The chatter goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krough was inspired by this : `` Before , I could n't do anything with traditional chatter . ''
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry .
In an elaborate procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver .
`` A lot of people in the region identify with the subject of talking tip - young and old , '' Reuter says .
It also supplies to the U.S. , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in chat and surroundings and who want a souvenir .
With that , I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the talking tip .

Project Hieve : Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday settlement of the Small Sea at Emden take shape .
The investor first unveiled public plans for the project .
A number of residents are still worried - they fear the sellout of their recreational fugitives
For months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , grated , debated and drawn .
Now , the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea are near Emden on the table .
The interested , the medium-sized Emder company `` System-Bau , '' presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council .
Originally , this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda .
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDA group that preached the investors and the administration , Ralf Behrend of the System-Bau-management board went on the offensive : `` We do not yet have an answer to all questions , '' he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors .
But it 's good to be able to meet all the rumors now .
The project , which is around ten to twelve million euros , has been under discussion for months .
Fierce reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting called the images and new details to the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , Meerbust 's owner and board member at the advocacy group 's advocacy group , Pro Hieve , is suing : `` This is going to be a giant clotting that surprised everyone else . ''
He also fears like many other project critics that traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase sharply : `` There must be full bus charges so that it expects , '' according to Schulz
However , what is happening on the good one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
There is still no operator .
`` First we have to have a coherent concept , '' said Ralf Behrend .
Because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable .

Internet sales rose at the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for that
In the first three months of 2015 , there was a seven per cent increase in online sales .
Last month was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
Experts believe the Black Friday in November has slowed spending
For over a decade , virtual shopping has drilled , and many of Britain 's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed just seven per cent in the first three months of 2015 .
Total spending for August represented the lowest rise in growth since records began in 2000 , with only five per cent increase over the previous year .
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed just seven per cent growth in the first three months of 2015
`` If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always evolved over time , '' said Andy Mulcahy , editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian .
He explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
It meant more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa .
But now this is shifting , and we may see that growth is diminishing .
The black-friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for declining sales .
Experts believe buyers will withhold their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
Last year , five times the average number of buyers scrambled around their computers to make their bargains , and some vendor websites crashed .
Experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers are battling for bargains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of £5 spending , a little more than £1 was spent online .
With some products such as televisions and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now done via web shops .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .

B & Q Boss says that the era of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen , says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind
As a result , 200 more Screwfix stores , aimed at artisans , will open
At the same time , Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner , City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons are laying down their hammers and brush in favor of using qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
If you can deal with a hammer or a brush to remove walls , you seem to be in a minority today .
Because Britons increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out pet jobs in their homes , according to the head of the company behind B & Q .
Véronique Laury , new chief executive of Kingfisher , which owns the tree-lined chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offers services to low prices , is now outdated .
That 's why Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores that cater to tradesmen and close 60 outlets of B & Q .
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B & Qshops , because eight out of 10 purchase decisions in the store are taken by women .
At the moment , the employees outweigh the men .
She said it was necessary to confront the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past .
Mrs Laury said : `` It still works by a majority of men in our branches .
We need to shift this closer to a balance .
Basically , half of our customers from women are 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
Women play a major role in the decision-making process .
Mrs Laury , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FTSE100 index , has also surrounded her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in senior positions .
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mrs Laury said : `` This was a deliberate decision - diversity is an important issue here .
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
Kingfisher reported a drop in half-year profit and moves after the group owed the cost of closing the stores .
Because of the trend , Kingfisher , the Screwfix and B & Q , will open 200 new stores .

8 poll results showing that Donald Trump is serious .
Some have tried to brand him as a flop .
Others dismissed him as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks at polls down , it ( still ) did n't work .
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump in the double-digit lead , and some are starting to get serious about what it means for the odds of the Real Estate 's nomination .
Of course , it is too early in the parliamentary term .
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry 's leadership was delivered to the rising Herman Cain , none of which won only one state in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps staying power and starting to let their dollars flow to topple him .
Here are some recent poll numbers suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase :
Trumps 's approval ratings have turned around 180 degrees .
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a poll by Monmouth-University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive .
By mid-July , it was 40 percent .
In early August , it was 52 percent .
Now , six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion .
And those numbers keep in early states .
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump .
Two-thirds of GOP-voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates .
In a CNN/ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they were either `` thrilled '' or `` satisfied '' if Trump was nominated .
Only two out of 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they would be `` thrilled '' vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump ) .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
On the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be `` dissatisfied '' or `` upset '' if Jeb Bush , the establishment 's favorite , would be the candidate .
A majority of Republicans do n't see Trumps temperament as a problem .
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and abusive statements , 52 percent of the Republican-leaning Irish voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president , according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday .
The same figure applies in the nation 's first pre-election state , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
Still , 44 percent think he does n't have the personality to effectively execute his office , and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House , according to ABC/Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
If they set up their erudition , Republican voters hold Trump for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , according to a CNN/ORC poll last week , four out of 10 say that Trump is the best bet .
This is a change since the time when four out of 10 at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP-voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
At this time in the last cycle , four out of 10 Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against just 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
Still , it is apparent that a variety of GOP-led voters see Trumps 's campaign as plausible .
Even if Republicans gathered around another candidate , Trump still beats almost anyone .
Some experts point out that the fractured field is likely to contribute to Trumps ' leadership , while anti-gun support is difficile to more than a dozen other candidates .
But a poll by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump is reaping majority support .
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina 's 13 points , ahead of Marco Rubio 's 14 points , before Walker scored 15 points , before Jeb Bush scored 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points .
It 's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race .
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds .
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have their voices fixed .
Of course , a lot can be done to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
Forty-six percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
Still , Trumps is strongest competition at the moment of the other outsider , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico `` rapist '' in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was pivotal in public discourse to 2016 .
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump 's crucial Hispanic-Americans will be kept away by the Republican Party and will damage the reorient efforts .
But according to the new ABC/Post poll Monday , six out of 10 Republicans say they are consistent with Trump on immigration issues .
So long as immigration remains in the limelight , Donald Trump seems to be doing it , too .
Frustration over the government clings to new highs .
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson , meanwhile , around half the support of Republican voters , mainly through their outsider status .
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll by ABC/Post that they 'd rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience .
And they 're also angry at Washington .
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa-Republians are frustrated by Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent `` dissatisfied '' and 21 percent `` hellish angry . ''

Jeremy Corbyns debut at Prime Minister 's Question Time
Since his election , Mr Corbyns 's debut at Prime Minister 's Question Time is eagerly awaited
The new Labour leader , Jeremy Corbyn , is expected to make his debut at Prime Minister 's Question Time and to equip himself with David Cameron for the first time .
MR Corbyn will stand up to put the first of its six straight questions shortly after noon , with his performance from the media likely and the Labour MP from close to scrutiny .
He called for `` less theater and more facts '' at this weekly event .
He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns 's leadership , since it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , the Labour leader 's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the fall of the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Torah MPs and is at the heart of several front page stories in the newspapers .
MR Corbyns decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had `` been in respectful silence '' and he acknowledged the `` heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air raid around England . ''
But a member of Mr Corbyns 's shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two Newsnout programme that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem `` regardless '' of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns 's top team , citing differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
The BBC 's Political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also `` stack up '' within Labour , following Mr Corbyns 's comments on the position on the European Union and the limit on profits .
MR Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was making changes to remove the whole idea of a limit overall .
Hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow labor and pensions minister , said that the party was `` very clear '' that it was only against government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000 .
MR Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron since he is Tory-leader in the last decade over the dispatch-box in parliament .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says he has `` crowd-sourced '' ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister 's Question Time is too confrontational , and that he will refrain from doing both `` batting '' and the striker with opposition , and has instead moved on to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
MR Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Business Secretary , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor , and that he addressed John Bercow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a `` fake theatre , '' which is often linked to the Prime Minister 's Question Time , but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so .
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the ruling by a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms .

DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundesliga set a clear sign at the weekend .
Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and secures its help in dealing with the problems that lie ahead .
`` I consider this to be the biggest challenge facing our country since reunification . ''
`` There 's no one can say in principle that this does n't matter to me , I do n't have anything to do with it . ''
`` This has to be of interest to everyone , to get to grips with this issue , '' DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach said .
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he is keen to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
`` I am in the chancellor next Wednesday and meet the secretary of state , Ms. Özoğuz and the Chancellor . ''
`` Because the issue will certainly play a central role , '' he announced .
Football can and wants to help .
The crucial course , however , must be the policy .
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative `` 1 : 0 for a Welcome '' by four years .
`` Over the Egidius-Braim Foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , '' said Mr Niersbach on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta .
Some federal officials also support this program .
As early as this weekend , the 36 professional clubs will send out a clear signal if they are going to wear the pressure `` We will help .
`` We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , '' said Rangers sports director Rudi Völler of the `` Bild '' newspaper ( Tuesday ) , calling the project `` self-evident . ''
`` The refugee drama goes to everyone , no one is allowed to look away . ''
`` We football leagues can , no , we have to use our blast , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , '' said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz .
Hoffenheim 's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a `` prominent sign of the league . ''
For the EM qualifier against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale .
Niersbach described the support of refugees as `` a great community of German football . ''
That all 36 licensed clubs would have started their own projects in their places is great .
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
The message `` 1 : 0 for a Welcome '' we spent is lived in football .
`` It 's of enormous importance , '' he said .
In this year and next year , the association , together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government , will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees .
`` The clubs have already retrieved the whole sum for 2015 , '' Niersbach reported .

Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö .
Di Maria meets on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to advance to Malmö .
Here 's the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday .
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as PSG player , who launched the French champions , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute .
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions as they seek not only qualifying for the knock-out passes , but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns .
But , while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blancs 's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate , and he was replaced later in the game against his home city team and against the club with whom he began his illustrious career as early as 1999 .
`` It 's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League , so it 's a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things we need to be perfecting over the course of the season , '' Blanc said .
`` This is a good omen .
We wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did n't score one or two more goals . ''
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the PD team that could hold a 2-2 draw at their own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend , but he was ousted by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
The Argentine wingman has been described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month , and he hinted at why , when he ran into Marco Verrattis 's pass behind the team 's defence , before he finished off to Johan Wiland , he finished off nicely in the long corner of the net .
However , if anyone believed that PSG would get a big win , that was disappointing .
Malmö , who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach that stage , joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and , with a five-man defence and two deep in the midfield , pitched a difficult opponent .
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , who passed wide to Kevin Trapps posts in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PSG himself admitted himself sometimes , with some mishaps and poor downpours , not least from Ibrahimovic , who was patched at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani used him after the restart .
Still , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic , whom Di Maria turned into a shooting shot , which was steered by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post
The second goal finally fell just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani , with the Uruguayan scoring his sixth season opener after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank from Maxwell .
That ended all the thought that Malmö could come back into the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wiland , from a short distance , to stop David Luiz , could keep the final result low , before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi escaped a goal at the end .
The coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , later admitted that PSG played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : `` Our last Champions League game was in December last year .
Since then , we 've only played in the Swedish league , which does n't have the same level .
The qualifiers are not enough . ''
Hats off to Paris !
It was a great game of them !

Death guard at Delta State University left apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shouted and killed his colleague later in the day , Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was `` sorry '' in the first murder and wanted `` he could make it undone , '' authorities announced on Tuesday .
Police in Gautier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the helpline at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
And said he fired on someone and someone killed .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency room that police had to send police to his home .
He said , `` I shot my wife last night '' and he also mentioned that a `` sweet dog '' was in the house but that `` no one will disturb '' but is likely to be excited .
Police asked the caller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
As police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Prentiss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said : `` I am so sorry , I wanted , I could undo it .
I loved Amy , and she 's the only woman who ever loved me . ''
After writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a professor of history , before eventually taking his own life on Monday night when police officers surrounded him .
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course there was something in Mr Lambs 's idea . ''
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said Tuesday that there was `` no information , no evidence '' for a `` triangular relationship . ''
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen , who testified that they were married about seven years , as a `` good man . ''
The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends .
O'Steen said he and Prentiss would have a daughter , who is 19 , and she was `` destroyed on the ground . ''
He said that Prentiss were her daughter `` absolutely best friends . ''
Prentiss worked online from home , according to testimony from Linsday Knowles , identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss .
Knowles said that Prentiss , who owned a dog called Lightning , had met with Lamb for about three years .
`` She always wanted to help other people , '' Knowles said
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time Monday to tell them `` he 's not going to jail . ''
When police arrested him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctorate in the spring of 2015 from Delta State University , as his life portrait indicates on the university 's website .

Konrad in search of 35,000 wintertime Quarters
Konrad has all hands to do with the transfer of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen-Banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
The chaos in the initial reception centre Traiskirchen has already come to grips with Konrad .
`` We do n't have homeless people in Traiskirchen , '' he told his first success .
Also , the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a big whistle , said Konrad and praised the organizational `` feat . ''
The Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a `` crisis-prone situation . ''
In total , Konrad expects a need of 85,000 Quarters in this year 's year .
To meet the number , 35,000 accommodation must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
If there are more refugees , we can do it .
`` But it 's not a barrel without ground , '' Konrad said .
With the state 's chief executives , he has already held talks .
They would have assured him that they would still be able to reach out for the coming refugees .
`` In Upper Austria , it 's going well , '' said Ferry Maier .
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad .
Tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn , to clarify how the Church will help .
Great expectations also put the asylum coordinator into the ORF action `` Helfen like us . ''
On the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
In addition , you are hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter .
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards for accommodation as `` very high . ''
In emergency times , it might not be possible for travel agents to have to comply with a certain amount of the towel or the size of the upper body .
For a temporary period , `` emergency standards '' would have to apply .
The fact that , unlike the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad is based on his experience .
I am an older gentleman who is not in the face of the falsehood .
Persuasion is his main weapon .
Konrad and Maier do not cause any costs to the Republic , as they declared themselves .
Their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
So far , their own quarters have not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office .
But there appear to be problems with approval .
Linz calls for better division
For the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
This is not necessary at the moment , because the people concerned can currently be accommodated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Luger ( SP ) .
For the emergency , however , other sites are to be tested for their suitability .
Critique exercises the city 's leader in the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
Other districts need to make their contribution here , too .

The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers-midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , as there is no title muscle with the Rangers .
De Boer , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : `` In Holland they do n't show highlights of the Celtics games more and why ? ''
It 's because the Rangers are not there .
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers .
You talk about the Old Firm .
They 're talking about both teams and that 's what they 're interested in .
There 's a lot of tension in the Old-Firm games , and it 's not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games .

I know it 's very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
We feel the same - but we must continue .
We really need , really , the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
It is so important to come together now .
Warburton cautious on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago , which hinted that he was rushing some January transfers , Rangers-boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entrants and insists he does not want to disrupt the unit of the Ibrox cadre .
The ex-boss of Brentford said : `` The January transfer window is very different from the summer window . ''
The players coming in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you 've seen with our own group this season .
The team is really good .
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtics target Michu with withdrawal note

Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to staff cuts for the past three years , the computer giant will cut further jobs in splitting the company .
The standings at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard ( HP ) are no end .
As part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate business .
This is expected to save costs of $ 2.7 billion ( $ 2.4 billion ) , the company said on Tuesday .
The move will result in a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
The reduction of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed .
HP employed some 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year .
Afterward , the HewPackard shares were up 2.3 percent .
The company , built with printers , is now split from California 's Palo Alto : So the computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
Both business units are expected to be listed on the stock exchange .
A more disappointing PC sales as well as weaker demand from corporate customers after its services ended the world 's second-largest PC maker , according to Lenovo .
In the third quarter at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers fell 11.5 percent .
Sales fell 8 percent to just $ 25.4bn .
As a result , the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a break-up and massive job cuts on the change in the industry .
The 76 year old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has been slow to respond to customers buying more smartphones and tablets rather than traditional computers and doing more and more business online .
Whitman 's restructuring plans see overall reduction of around 55,000 jobs .

First feisty , then distinctive cold front
In the coming night , in the valleys of the Alpine side of the hair dryer , as MeteoSwitzerland announced on Tuesday .
On Wednesday and on the night of Thursday , the hair dryer partly blows with storm strength through the feisty valleys .
After feisty on Thursday morning , a distinctive cold front crosses us , bringing heavy rains , wind gusts and a temperature drop .
As MeteoNews writes in a note , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Isles in a vigorous southwest .
On the Alpine side , on the night of Wednesday the hair dryer will break through the valleys .
As a result , the hair dryer will blow up by Thursday morning in the Farewell valleys with embankments of 60 to 100 km/h , occasionally and especially in the Urnerland , with more than 100 km/h .
The hair dryer can penetrate into the adjacent Mittelland , and on the mountains can even be orkanes of more than 120 km/h .
While in the north on Wednesday , the moisture reaches for summery temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity at the Alpensüdhang begins .
Here 's rain , which lasts until Thursday night .
In sum , south of the Alps , over 100 litres of rain per square metre must be expected in the next 48 hours , after which a large amount of rain has already fallen in the last few days .
On Thursday morning , the hair dryer will air , in the episode rolling a cold front with strong , partially weathered rain from West to east across Switzerland .
Along with the cold front , the wind winds up sharply to stormy weather , and temperatures are falling sharply .
The following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , but in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the weekend .

Eurowings : Lufthansa builds the group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
Half a billion euros a year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save itself with a better organisation .
150 of the world 's roughly 1,000 executives will cost the group restructuring the job .
However , there are new negotiations with the pilots ' union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the low-cost carriers of Eurowings .
The aim of the realignment is an earnings contribution of about €500 million a year from cost and proceeds syncing , the airline said on Wednesday .
Among other things , Lufthansa does not have a board in the future for the passenger business .
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible .
In future , Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings .
With the new position , Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future .
So far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three-quarters of the company 's annual sales of 30 billion euros .
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining agreement with the pilot association Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are expected to resume after the court 's legal strike on Thursday .
That told the union .
The subject of the talks is intended to be the retirement scheme for pilots .
`` In a year with a projected record result , '' the cockpit aims to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible .
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots , the `` Wings '' savings concept .
It provides that Lufthansa , in the fight against competitors , places routes to the Group 's own low-cost line Eurowings .

Röszke : Outbreak of violence on Serbia 's Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed on the Serbian border at Röszke Tearengas and water cannons against several hundred refugees .
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
He reported by telephone :
A group of refugees broke the border .
Behind it , a police line was formed and behind the policemen there was a water cannon .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles , according to officials .
The officers initially stopped pepper spray .
After that , police used tear gas .
A lot of tear gas has been spilled in the direction of the refugees .
As a result , the group was disbanded .
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat .
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
Children who had inhaled tear gas shouted .
Other refugees sacked in themselves and suffered from breathing .
Serbian police officials also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .

Rome now has a Martin-Luther-seat
Almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin-Luther-square in Rome .
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino on Wednesday , a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio Hill was christened the name of the German Reformist .
On the `` Piazza Martin Lutero , '' he is now recognized as the `` German Theologist of the Reformation . ''
The park is located in the heart of the old Rome , right next to the Coliseum .
The name was requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome .
Jens-Martin Kruse , pastor of the Evangelical Ossetian community in Rome , recalled Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the pope over centuries as a minority were often only allowed to live in secret their faith .
The square becomes symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 1483-1546 ) was regarded as a young Augustinian mönch around the turn of the year 1510/11 some months in Rome .
He found the city at the time as an outdated scapegoat .
His negative impressions may have encouraged him , according to historians , in his later battle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the evening 's Church with his theses against the decline .

Experts criticise report from Public Health England over e-cigarettes
Allegations by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , in part with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PHE ) in its report on e-cigarettes .
PHE released the `` principle report '' last month , describing it as a `` comprehensive review of the evidence . ''
But some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the `` extraordinarily windy basis '' on which PHE reasoned its main conclusion .
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims were `` based on stone or sand . ''
Martin McKee , professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . ''
They said the public expects that PHE 's claim that `` the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking '' are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
In fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people convened to develop a model for multiple causal decision-making analysis ( Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA ) to lead their opinions on the damage from different nicotine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health , whose managing director was previously told of British American Tobacco funds ( BAT ) for an independent study .
He also underwrote BAT 's references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was expected to receive after reports previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International , added it .
The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not delivered , but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
At the meeting , PHE 's tobacco management also attended .
The group 's research `` admits tellingly '' that there is a lack of `` hard evidence of the damage to most products on most criteria , '' wrote McKee and Capewell .
However , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report .
McKee and Capewell said that PHE 's claims that `` there has so far been no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers '' were premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and well-being at PHE , said that BMJ 's claims had already been responded before .
He said : `` e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . ''
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction .
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the national health care system £2 billion a year .
By clarifying current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk , but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction .

Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better ?
It 's one thing that all parents learn soon : If your child loves a book , it wo n't last long before you know it almost out of touch .
Unless , of course , you may be David Cameron .
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children 's book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss .
It was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company 's super camps , and continues : `` fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it 's a book that I am happy to read out to my children , because there always seems to be a picture or a message that we 've missed so far . ''
All nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the book 's plot , instead reflects a summary of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
`` In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win the girl of his dreams , by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , '' reads : A love interest was Dr. Seuss , whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991 , but was completely unaware of that in 1991 .
As if that was not suspicious enough : The text presented by Cameron reads , in part , as the summary of the Lorax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : `` In the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , is hoping to win the girl of his dreams . ''
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father , Cameron seems unlikely to be so familiar with the action of the book , listening to an unnamed boy , such as the local environment , by the money hawkish , trees fake , Thneed knitting onlookers despite the protests of the namesake Lorax , a hooky , cordoned-off creature , `` which speaks in the name of the trees , '' to be devastated .
Most likely , such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to come from Cameron 's constituency office .
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron 's staff but gave no further immediate comments .

Google launches doubling donor campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GOOGL ) announced a doubling fundraising campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach in announcing the donor call on his blog .
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Masoud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old , was talking about her personal experiences .
`` To our trip there were many dark rail and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , '' she wrote .
I was lucky .
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate for help .
The donations go to four charities providing assistance to refugees and migrants : Doctors Without Borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to google.com/divestment to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

'American Ninja Warrior ' crowned first champion
Professional sports climbers and operating guide Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took the grand prize of $ 1 million with home .
The Competition Show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
During the season finale , two men , Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten , managed to reach the finals .
To the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Britten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior , but Caldiero completed that challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Caldiero spoke with E ! News after the hard-won victory , still under the shock of winning the Great Price of $ 1 million .
`` I mean , it 's amazing to think about it , I 've never earned more than $ 10,000 or been alive , '' said Isaac E ! About his pile of money .
So all of a sudden ... as I ca n't even imagine how that is , the future is unknown .
The senior producer , Kent Weed , sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten , although he was the first ever to finish the course , did not receive any prize money .
According to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
`` If there are more than one finalists , it gets the one with the fastest time , '' Weed said .
How much the money is a wonderful price and changes life , it gets the great gratification .
I do n't think he has any grudge about that .
He 's just so happy to have done what he 's done .
Crowds of awards he received from fans .
He 's such a great guy and a family friend .
He is a hero for his children and his wife .
Geoff said to me : `` If I should be beaten by someone , I 'm glad it 's Isaac . ''
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an Eighth season , filming will begin in the spring of 2016 .

'Sonogenetics ' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves .
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that have high frequencies for human hearing .
The impulses work by switching Motoneuron cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
More on this subject : Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure , called sonogenetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Fade worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did it when surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles .
The bubbles , he found out , amplify the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate the worms .
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the seasoning cells .
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , according to a report by Nature Communications .
To create ultrasound controlled nematodes , Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4-ion channels .
If he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are amplified by the microblows and transferred to the worms where they turn the modified Motoneurons .
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons with pulses of light on and off .
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
In contrast to light , which must be sent down to an optical fibre to the desired location in the brain , low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue freely and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull .
`` We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , '' Chalasani said .
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

Man after fired police chase persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he overtook the man off the Canning River .
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang up the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and marshy waters , just yards away from a police officer who tried to `` gently persuade him to return to the shore . ''
Police at Canning Vale were called to a domestic violence gang incident in Beckenham on Tuesday .
When they discovered the suspect , this one tried to escape them towards Canning River .
But he did n't get too far .
`` He stood in the water and said 'I do n't get out , come and get me , ' '' said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine .
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was n't too keen to make his uniform wet , so he used a more reliable tactic - `` A good policeman is negotiating . ''
`` Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , '' said Senior Sergeant Castledine .

In 2006 , Cousins drove his car into the ditch to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River .
His efforts were unsuccessful , but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-biathlon .

Spacecraft 'Cassini ' finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice panzer of Saturn 's Enceladus , a global ocean swung .
This includes researchers from observations of the spacecraft `` Cassini . ''
As a result , the moon appeared easily on its trajectory around the ring planks .
While this thawing movement is only small but too large for a consistently solid celestial body , it is said in a statement released by Cornell University in Ithaca ( US state of New York ) Tuesday .
The researchers present their analyses in the journal `` Icarus . ''
Even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus .
Thus , `` Cassini '' had already discovered ice vulcanes at Saturn 's South Pole in 2006 , spying water vapour and ice particles , and thus feeding the so-called E-Ring of Saturn .
At least at the South Pole , there must be a subterranean sea , the astronomers concluded at the time .
However , the extension of the hidden ocean was not clear .

Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that was still the last week of the view that the Fed will do so , now thinks the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent .
It 's a historic event because it 's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL .
`` For the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero area and launching a process of normalizing interest rates , '' said Angel Ubide , chief of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The US economy is on a relatively good performance , trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate low inflation .
However , the Fed can not ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions .
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good .
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday

The Brexit-Lager ( Brexit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could win on allowance if the economy gets into a slump by 2017
David Cameron 's ill-fated renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy `` Is it Yes or No ? '' Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the Tuc , who are fiercely divided because of Europe on Tuesday .
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages .
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some member states , as deeply entangled in various crises , as the EU is now , and not always of their own fault , Britain 's own agenda with divided concessions and disturbing treaty changes , which they mostly do not want , are fed up .
In Brighton , the Tuc decided at its annual meeting that it did not like them if they were at risk of social protection .
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie 's agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photograph of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
It 's always about me .
My European friend , who wants a Britain that is outside the EU in the interior of the EU tent - `` not alone with France , '' says Berlin - and suggests that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go .
Germany 's cautiously bespectacled Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the excessively long audition like Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France 's François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017 .
He is also a fading force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government , Spain a leftist .
It is hard to imagine that they will pull out a leg to help the selfie-British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland 's exit from being out of the UK - something they do n't want either , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
So perhaps some such ministers are planning even deliberately not helpful remarks , entirely in the SNP-style , during Britain 's referential campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexite process , my friend is suspected .
`` The renegotiation was a default '' and `` Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation . ''
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be on its cost , and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the Pressebarone , as they did during Tony Benn 's inspired referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
They can look weak on Boris Johnson , the ore euro opportunist who has made himself a name as a `` EU Gerade Banks '' Brussels-based correspondent in the early 90-years .
With all his reticence , Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
This included the Medley of tax-raising villains , phone hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-Instates that own most of our major newspapers .
In fact , Tony Blair thought similar about her , but noted that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage , you better spread bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
In fact , Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron 's refereeing dumbbells , because Blair had put the principle on the EU 's unapproved constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door to him .
The press has never told him to do so .
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave me a friendly knock on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he did n't need to waste any time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock 's boycott Murdoch 's strategy of the 80-year-old , a mistake then and today .
It can last , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , whose BBC-Sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyns 's official position on Europe is - I call it a friendly - in development .
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU .
Now , most of the people outside Ukip 's traditional blistering bulletins and the wildest jails of Tory 's petty Englishism can probably say yes to everyone .
It 's what Hilary `` A Benn , but no Bennite '' Benn on the radio and television this week said when the Scouts struggled in him , not to admit that Corbyns 's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 70-years when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hilary 's fight was even more appealing .
But struggling to stay `` under any circumstances '' - Benny 's expression - was not what McDonnell said was still what JC told his comrades and deputies after all the reports at their Clues ' meeting on Monday night .
Whatever the stemmed Bottom-Up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and , above all , in the strudel of social media , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour support in the referendum campaign for granted , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyns 's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy , their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents , for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes .
As with his ambiguities to Nato - Tom Watson is felony confident that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense of their superiors at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can all be pointless ?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and in Syria , even with a cost-cutting of the Tory government in power , where I was reminded of something at the start on Monday , which was called the British Influence Security Forum .

Manege invites to dream
With the new staging `` passion , '' the Circus Probst takes on the traditions of circus art .
The goal is to draw every age group in the spell of fascinating acrobatics , animal dressage and unique entertainment .
Now the Circus Probst in the manege on the brick wall invites you to dream .
`` Our passion is the circus . ''
`` I ca n't imagine living without my circus family , '' says Stephanie Probst , animal teacher and junior director .
`` Passion '' - under this motto is the current manning stage .
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years .
The gift to inspire the family , therefore , is in the blood .
`` It is important for us to bring people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , '' the 27-year-old Juniper says .
`` Manegencocktail with a world flair , '' director Reinhard Probst calls his concept .
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
Distinguished at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm .
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
With the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to be relaxed .
Ease and agility - with these words , they identify .
Her humorous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women 's hearts in the storm .
In addition to numerous salmon salves , the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with sensitivity and homogeneity .
Balancing the wheel on a ball ?
For He Yuan no problem .
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time .
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little else and fascinated with her mobility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
`` The animals belong to our family , '' notes Stephanie 's mother , Brigitte Probst .
Grievances in the attitudes of circus animals are all too often an issue in various animal welfare organisations .
Stephanie Probst also takes a position : `` It is not good for our animals , but we are not doing well . ''
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
The `` four-legged artistes , '' as they are affectionately called , are forgotten after the possibility of any request from the eyes .
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
If the animal does n't feel comfortable , it does n't want to be in the manege either .
So the most important thing is to do well for the animals .
Especially on their zebroid Jumbo , a mixture of a Shetland ponytail and a zebra , the family Probst is proud .
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a walkway and nothing has happened .
`` But then , suddenly , our little Jumbo was there , '' Brigitte Probst told me .
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege , but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst .
So there should be something for every visitor .
`` One thing is certain , '' says Stephanie Probst : `` No matter whether five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with all the heart of it . ''
The Circus Probst invites its performances from 17 to 20 September on a daily basis .
On Sunday , the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5pm the prices are discounted .
It is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .

EU seeks to double mercury limit in predator fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and give consumers a much higher dose of nerve .
The consumer organisation Foodwatch , which has a corresponding working paper from the EU , strongly criticised the plans : `` Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed with full force to pregnant women and infants , '' explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch .
According to Wolfschmidt , the limits of the nerve agent for large fish are to be raised at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish for `` economic reasons '' from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
However , major predators are already so heavily burdened with mercury that about 50 per cent of catches can not be sold on the basis of the existing limit values .
After doubling the limit values , then only 14.5 per cent would be unsettled .
In exchange for this easing , according to Foodwatch , the EU wants to tighten the limits on other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
Foodwatch , however , called this `` trick '' because smaller gravefish , such as carp are mostly so low , that they are already meeting the planned highs today .
The reduction in small numbers is therefore `` a perfidious distraction that helps the economy alone , '' Wolfschmidt explained .
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which spreads heavily over the food chain , especially in predators .
The federal government therefore warns that `` already small quantities can be particularly caused by unborn skulls of the nervous system . ''
The Federal Ministry of the Environment , on its website with regard to current levels , says that a `` health hazard to the general population '' is not to be expected .
Mercury is mainly due to coal burning into the environment .
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal-fired power plants have more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany , according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry .
The concentration of mercury in fish , for example , in the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube , was `` permanently and comprehensively crossed , '' the `` Mirror '' was quoted from the paper in March .
Last year , Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF .

Ecumenical Hospice Relief Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
There is non-stop operation around the Mannheimer Exhibition Centre .
People do their concerns , sometimes fast paces , partially cozy bumbling .
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalons at the venue .
Keep city streets .
Pulsating , prall life at wonderful autumn solstice and mittens four large plates each with the headline `` Bevor I die I want to be . ''
The Ecumenical hospitalization , with this action , drew attention to its 20-year existence and is certainly facing mixed reactions .
`` It 's about life , so we 've gone with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , '' says Josefine Lammer .
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Relief is available to the passers-by as well as to questions and talks , such as the volunteers .
While some prefer a passer-by spontaneously to chalk up , `` read the phrase `` my life , '' `` with the camper going through the United States , '' `` to stop the war '' or `` not suffer for a long time , '' others remain short , read , say phrases like `` so far I 'm not yet '' and then go on .
Time and again , on the sidelines , there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , how to deal with the dying .
Even Peter Hübinger is just on the spot .
`` Just when I make it clear that for me to end up coming to the end of this world , I can live responsibly , '' says the director of the Diakonic Works of Mannheim , which is jointly with the Caritas-based Association of Ecumenical Hospital Assistance .
Therefore , this high-profile action on 20-year-olds is good .
The fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
The subject of death and dying is still littered with taboos , according to the experience of Josefine Lammer , although just the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to people opening up .
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares .
The death and funeral companion is one of the volunteer staff of the first hour .
Confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia .
When the Ecumenical hospitalization was sought by calling volunteers , they immediately reported and had been involved in the creation in 1995 .
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and loved ones in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hospice of St Vincent .
All of them are carefully trained .
Angelika Godefroid can do well with her job and his experiences and experiences .
`` I see the life of another warty , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , '' she says .
The offer of the outpatient Öcumenian hospice service is free of charge and confessional .
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from families and associations enables the training as well as training and supervisions of the dying and funeral attendants .
Every two years we offer training for new employees .
The panels described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
Further personal wishes can also be noted on postcards .

Ios 9 : How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , typing on `` General '' and then selecting `` Software Update . ''
If it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message indicating that the `` software update failed . ''
To avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait for the rush to decline or try to update via iTunes .
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it less likely to do so by streamlining the update , and it will be easier to do that if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete .
It 's worth making sure your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is near a charging device , so the battery is loaded .
If the charge is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may be shut down halfway and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .
Read : Ios 9 release still on schedule despite the WatchOS delay in reviewing iOS 9 : The least exciting , but the best update of iOS 9 : How to prepare for the new iPhone operating system
You should also make sure that before you download our checklist of all things , to prevent things from going wrong and protect yourself if they do , iOS 9 brings new features , including a much wiser personal assistant , and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : 'We are creating this '
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
What is going on in Germany ?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : `` I say again and again : We can create this , and we create that . ''
What is going on in Germany gives the following overview .
According to different forecasts between 350000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400000 ( estimate of the Pestel Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
That 's almost twice as much as previously built ( 250,000 homes ) .
As a result , the lack of housing is , above all , affordable rental property : 60 000 to 80 000 social housing starts per year , and this particularly favourable housing will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from the current 518 million to one billion euros .
Far too little is that from the perspective of the Plague Institute : 80 000 social housing should be created annually , and the federal government would have to invest $ 6.4 billion a year .
The scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is estimated that , in the long term , 55 percent of the birds in Germany can be employed .
However , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them in their entry , criticising Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation .
For the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording company , but also for the self-esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt .
In Germany , according to Thränhardt , there has been a political change : From the work ban on refugees to the recognition of work .
While there used to be a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as residency duty , which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
In society , partly because of the shortage of skilled labour , there has been a majority view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
A major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of English .
To date , there has not been a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
Research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts .
The building of networks is therefore , according to Thränhardt , the premier route to work integration .
The Berlin School Board has found that only a few winged parents give their children to the Kitchens , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : `` For the uprooted parents , it 's only once very important to keep the family together , '' says Ilja Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
In order to convince the family of the advantages of Kita , the administration distributes hand papers in different languages .
Should the need for educators rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example , by allowing more specialist schools .
In the countries , students without a German language are prepared in welcome classes on the classroom .
But they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in English as a second language .
There is no shortage of them , says Beate Stafford of the Berlin School Administration .
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle , no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient studies - the only exception to so far has been Berlin , the interior senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) , but has now abandoned his stance .
Study willing refugees could facilitate access to the university .
For refugees with a residence permit or acquiescence do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seeker law when they start studying .
The latter , in principle , do not get a BAföG , as they do not fall within the circle of eligible persons .
Patient refugees have so far had to live four years in Germany to be Bafög-eligible , from 1 January 2016 , this span reduced to 15 months .
This funding gap must also be closed , however , by Steffen Krach , Berlin 's Secretary of State for Science , and Deutsche Studentenwerk .
Students should get BAföG immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and develop the existing state church law into a new statehood relationship .
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association , which takes care of the newcomers in a professional manner .
Rights also include duties .
In this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain control options .
This includes a willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Aiman Mazyek , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
Those who wanted to end such conflicts in Germany `` immediately have their right to be here , in Germany , forfeited , '' he said in Bavarian radio .
He suggested translating the Basic Law to Arabic .
Integration will continue to be an issue for the whole of society in the future .
This will also have to change the majority society , and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing .
Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti-discrimination agency for a mere decade and a general equality law .
But it learns very slowly , as the NSU murder scene showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
Equal opportunities for all : What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long called for , and for international agreements such as the anti-racism convention of Germany , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
In general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees so far , according to medical correspondent Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
`` As for man- power and capacity , we are creating that , '' he told the Daily Mirror .
However , additional money must be channelled into the system .
To avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery urges all residents to hand out health cards equal to the registry .
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states .
And , in the long run , it is highly questionable to eat so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seeker scheme is proposing .
Otherwise , doctors , in particular , create the language barriers .
So far , the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are worse off about their illnesses than other patients .
Not only in clinics , but also in doctors ' practices , interpretation costs would have to be accepted .
However , it would also help many refugees with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances .
And with another diagnostic look .
In the case of refugee children , for example , there are considerably more untreated disabilities , and young people are concerned with HIV .
With some of the other symptoms of the disease , German doctors would be able to learn from their training , according to Montgomery .
`` Parasite beatings or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect , '' and as far as the doctors shortage is concerned , the refugees may even have relief in sight .
The Syrians have a highly developed education system , and many refugees are even doctors .
In order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps take exams again .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill , according to estimates by the Federal Foreign Office ( BPtK ) : Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Particularly vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Munz , president of BPtK .
A recent study by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children is traumatized in Germany .
Anyone who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder suffers from , among other things , so-called flashbacks with breathlessness , dizziness , heart rashes and death fears .
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong dreadfulness and emotional deafness .
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Munz explained .
So far , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy .
While mentally ill asylum seekers can make a request for psychotherapy in the social offices , it usually takes several months .
In addition , in the social authorities , specialist workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
This often leads to miscalculations , says Munz .

Football : BvB without Reus against Krasnodar : Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund , all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League were finally broken .
The national team will also be missing the league leader of the Football League in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday ( 7 p.m./Sky ) .
`` We unfortunately can not resort to him , '' Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday .
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday , the BVB coach left open : `` We expect a return of him to training on Friday . ''
Given the heavy stress of its pros , Tuchel will change its Stammelf not only on the Reus position .
So he announced a switch on the goalkeeper position .
That 's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of master keeper Roman Bürki .
`` He trains at an absolute top level , '' the football teacher praised the world champion .
Whether Weidenfeller is used in the future in all Europa League games , however , Tuchel left open .
With high probability , he will also play the second game .
The foray statement by fellow players Reus that the final entrant for the BVB in the Europa League should be the goal , holding midfielder Julian Weigl for understandable : `` This is Marco not so wrong . ''
`` I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . ''

Pleasant bathing temperatures : The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
Even though peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing tourists to find warm water .
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
Some people do not go into the sea : A maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DWD ) .
In contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : In the East , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
In the Adriatic , it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

Delicate folk from Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago , Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
Next to him stands a flipchart , on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with fillip .
The entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by Stevens talk .
He tells of different places he keeps recording on the map , what his minutest and tender arranged songs .
Where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
Since then , Stevens has turned out to be a wonderfully creative lunatic .
With the 2003 and 3rd album `` Greetings from Michigan : The Great Lake State , '' he cleverly composed songs that blend harmoniously with the American folk of the late sixties , but always be able to drift into the great opulence .
There 's the rumor , `` Michigan '' would be the first part of a twisted series : Each of the 50 US states should be bested in succession .
As early as 2004 and in Rheinnear , `` Seven Swans '' has already appeared and breaks positive expectations .
As a result , Stevens is stepping down here .
Live is enough for him to play guitar and banjo .
A year later , the musician living in New-York is returning to the series .
With `` Illinois '' ( `` Sufjan Stevens Present You To : Come on Feel The Oregoise '' ) appears a nationwide celebrated masterpiece in 2005 .
Brimming with ideas and stylistic finesse .
The album is rising into the American Billboard charts and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media .
After exceedingly productive experiments , Stevens then served on `` The Age of Adz '' ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic computations .
This sixth proper studio album is still widely orchestrated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and Hall .
As long as the smaller clubs have moved away , the stage shows here will be the colourful spectacle of neon-foreheads and large fluorescent Bühnendeko .
Today , Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-man band .
In the dark Hamburg More !
He mainly presents the `` Carrie & Lowell , '' which has been available since March .
Although there are now nearly 2,000 guests stranded in their chairs , the far more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk .
Without giving a word to the audience , the group is playing excellent musicians through the widely enriched album .
From the audience , one hears : The talk is `` opulent '' and you can throw the `` record straight away . ''
First of all , Stevens abdicated modestly , playing acoustically few older songs , and eventually reverted to the applause .

Ishinger : German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich security conference , Wolfgang Ischinger , considers military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
`` I believe the determined reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , '' he said .
He accused the European states of `` collective ways . ''
Four years ago , one was pleased that the Kelch had gone past a military involvement in Germany .
`` Now the conflict is ending up on our doorstep , '' he said in German radio .
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees .

Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while rising in the UK overall .
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period .
Scotland 's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK 's 5.5 per cent , as figures from the Office for National Statistics ( ons ) showed .

Michael J . Fox jokes about his `` date '' with Princess Diana
The premiere of `` Back to the Future '' was a great moment for Michael J . Fox .
It was also remarkable for personal reasons .
`` We sat in the theatre waiting for the Royals , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it 's gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , '' he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary `` Back in Time . ''
The film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simulated yawn and an armesa length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date .
`` Back in Time , '' a documentary about `` Back to the Future , '' presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg .
`` Back for the Future '' had premiered 30 years ago .
`` It 's really for me , '' Spielberg said , `` uncontroversial the greatest time travel film ever shot . ''

Robot cars : Government wants to lead the way for Germany
Germany , according to the will of the Federal Government , is to be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the auto show IAA of a `` new mobility age . ''
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , Dobrindt said .
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries , who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA .
The Transport Ministry 's strategy paper emphasizes , among other things , the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio .
To test new technology , there is currently a test track on Highway 9 in Bavaria .
In order for the driver to `` not be saddled with any additional liability risks , '' the federal government wants the legal framework `` to review and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . ''
For example , Germany wants to work internationally to raise the maximum speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres .
The Federal Government also wants to apply for a change to the Vienna Convention , which so far provides only for the people as drivers .
In the case of automated driving , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
According to a study presented by the economic ministry , highly automated driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible .
Still , driverless vehicles on public roads are expected to be `` only far after 2020 . ''
The added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site of Germany value the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
`` The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , '' said SPL transport policy chief Sören Bartol .
However , the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the drivers ' personal data must be clearly clarified .
Still , the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans .
A survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA Institute of Forsa Institute on behalf of the Investigating Decra comes to the conclusion that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 per cent do not expect it in 20 years , and 31 per cent do not believe it at all .
In France , 21 percent of those polled with autonomous cars by 2025 , 33 percent in the United States .
Anyway , motorists in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle .
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom , only seven percent would agree to take control throughout the ride on all roads .
On the motorway , that could mean 15 per cent in flowing traffic , in the traffic jam 45 per cent .
Well every fourth would not leave the car to control under any circumstances .

Terraced houses for refugees , single parents , low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses for people who do not have much money .
For example , for refugees - but also as a signal : `` Not only refugees need living room , but also the mother and the low paid . ''
`` I show how you can still build good and well today , '' the 44-year-old says in interview
Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market .
The entrepreneur , Markus Gildner , is believed to know how quickly living space can be created : He is building terraced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gildner , many refugees will push into the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability .
Because people stay to a large part here .
Given the flow of refugees , we also need enough housing in the next few decades .
A completely banal , three-storey terraced house is the solution .
Gildner : A terraced house needs the least place .
It facilitates integration .
That 's different when you 're letting people down in residential blocks .
Each of the six houses currently built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers .
Each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room .
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
What is the cost ?
Gildner : The price of 160 square feet of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
That is manageable .
The construction lasted six months .
That is reasonable .
Have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gildner : I have mastered my project correctly .
It is particularly difficult to find the threat of Damoklessch special construction and the location regulation .
Grinning .
It is still subject to who in a terraced house creates three flats , needs at least three pitches .
Only in the cities there is no room for this .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How did the residents react to their terraced home project ?
Gildner : There were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
Which is definitely not true .
But do you not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : True , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
My project has the message , even ordinary people need housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low paid .
I show how to build cheap and well today .
That is what it is all about .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses .

At its most anticipated meeting in the years , Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it 's time to raise the benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
Looming over them at one end of the decorated , two-story session is a wall image of the United States .
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation 's economic interests ahead of all other things .
The central bank has a two-run order from Congress : Maximizing U.S. employment and prices here stable .
But since the Great Recession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unscripted third mandate : Financial stability .
And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict , and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is startlingly ready to disengage from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
Although most of the economy 's data show that it is growing solid , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious FedEx officials fearful of increasing this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter of a percentage point .
`` Obviously , the job market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they watch , '' said Lindsey M. Piegza , chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co .
`` But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , '' she said .
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do , which is uncertain of the financial market itself .
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week .
Financial markets , however , expect a Fed wait , with a key indicator indicating only a 30 per cent chance of an increase .
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16,599.85 .
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise rates at this time , '' he said .
If she does , `` she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do n't panic . ''
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed on a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Yellen said in spring and early summer that this year , despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the rate would be expected .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the job market this year was solid .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And although inflation was consistently below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , FedEx officials said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
The economy `` can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the job market , '' said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
But financial markets around the world rallied late last month after China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 16 % below its peak in May as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would cut global growth .
The market has recovered somewhat this month , with the Dow now up nearly 10 % below May 's high .
For the FedEx officials , the market turmoil affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates .
`` If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last couple of weeks , they would put the reins in this session , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , senior research fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official .
Now , he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , '' Oliner said .
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed 's main concerns , so it should not be included in its decision-making process .
But , at the end of the day , the Fed has become the world 's monetary authority .
The central bank 's influence has been enormous in recent years .
The mere hint of then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could `` narrow '' its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , FedEx officials can expect that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision-making is `` more art than science , '' said Zachary Karabell , head of global strategy for asset management firm Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA , noted this month that `` the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that with apparently not linked to economic fundamentals . ''
Lacker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advocating an increase in interest rates , cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions `` despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the US , '' Lacker said .
A year later , FedEx officials reversed those cuts .
The Fed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. Poznan , former member of the Committee on Retirement of the Bank of England .
The recent turmoil does not come near that level , he said .
`` She certainly does n't want to get into the situation where she 's afraid of a rate hike because the markets are getting up , '' said Poznan , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should be ahead of time .

BBC radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says member of parliament Andrew Bingham
The conservative the member of the parliament criticized the transmitter because of his “ stultification ”
It argues that he is not to be differentiated increasingly of commercial rivals .
It aimed also at the BBC Music Awards and said that they imitated only The Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked the transmission The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC radio 3 “ changes itself ” to Classic FM , maintains a prominent member of parliament and increases new pressure to the transmitter to prove that it does something , to what the private stations does not do .
The conservative delegate Andrew Bingham said also to the BBC bosses that the public radio station “ hebetates ” and increasingly no more from its commercial competitors to is not to be differentiated .
“ Radio 3 seems - I do not use the word “ hebetate ” gladly - however it seems to Classic FM to transform ” , said it .
It aimed also at the BBC Music Awards , which started in last December .
The BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Brits seem to be only under another name .
Thus to do , if you try , something else - these are two examples spontaneously specified , with which you imitate actually only that , which on the market is already ” , said Mr Bingham .
BBC general manager rejected the reproaches and argued that BBC radio 3 lay far before its commercial competitors , if it concerns live music and clearing-up of the public .
Which I learn from radio 3 , which I will not differently learn over classical music anywhere .
And there is a commitment for live music and making music , which are really unsurpassed .
“ And the commitment of radio 3 also real to find and new works in order give new music , consider I important ” , said he .
Beginning of this year argued BBC radio 3 CONTROLLER Alan Davey that harder had to be worked to engage the audience when it did this in the past , because the British are informed about classical music less .
Radio 3 was not however the only element of BBC production , which came during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport under fires to step the commercial rival on the feet .
The Tory delegate Damien Collins seized The Voice on the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ .
Do you see , why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly saliently ?
Lord Hall insisted on the fact that the BBC 1-show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced “ in special BBC way ” .
It added , it desires that the enterprise finds “ a hit from our internal stable ” , if it starts next time an entertainment series .
However it refused excluding the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or spending money of the fee payers on other maintenance formats .

Hospital Peißenberg pulls after already gau
The hospital Peißenberg is to be closed in former times than planned - 2016 .

The station as well as the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg also after already gau .
The surprising plans that plan that hospital GmbH of the district , which confirmed district administrator Andrea Jochner-Weiß .
A decision over it meets however the supervisory board , and September meets on coming Wednesday , 23 .
If the plans should be converted , then all were further-employed that scarcely 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg .
The vast majority is to move with Fischer and that far existing internal station after already gau .
The areas are present .
A job is to be offered to the employees , who can not also after already gau , so yoke he Weis in because home .
The employees are informed about the plans .
Released the change the notice of Dr. Andreas Eder , who is only since beginning of the year a medical director of the Schongauer hospital now and changes to a private practice into more direct proximity of the hospital .
With the question , who was to begin the follow-up , the name “ Fischer ” came into the play according to yoke he Weis , who explained itself ready to take over and change with its team to already gau starting from 1 October the line .
For the house in already gau mean this in each case a “ revaluation ” and a widening of the offer within the range “ internal medicine ” , thus yoke he Weis .

Already gau ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the internal station in gastroenterologische illnesses .
Transitionally for the next two years Fischer with its team , if the supervisory board agrees , is to lead both houses , until then in the next year the former hospital the scarce shank , which has still 35 beds , in Peißenberg is to be closed after nearly 140 years finally .

Why I a witness of an execution in Oklahoma will be
Somewhat later today , exceptionally with a late legal intervention , I will watch , how a man is brought to death .
If it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary will sit , if Richard Glossip is executed by the lethal injection .
It asked me to be one of the four official witnesses with its death .
The invitation was made already for the first time in January by its best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
When the day moved more near , I began , to be afraid me .
Thus , why I should do it ?
I agreed , because I thought , it would be a good possibility of tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would offer a singular perspective .
It is correct the fact that journalists may see executions in the USA and there more applications than places is often available , takes place a makabere lottery , in order to decide , who is selected .
Oklahoma reduced the number of medium places of 12 to five .
Who is selected , which will emotionless observe it .
I can not do that .
I will sit beside Richard Glossips 's closest friend , with whom I mean own relationship in the course of the months with telephone calls and two and a half hours a visit developed .
I like the chap .
We laugh often much , if we speak .
The prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , therefore it me will be not permitted to carry a note book and a pin forward over to note , what I see .
I must try simply to remind me to all details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of on Twitter to give my impartiality up .
Here is the lesson .
Tell the story of the prisoner , how it wants it , and you receive entrance .
I weighted with it .
It granted that she could have better formulated “ it ” , but it thinks still that it is wrong , which I do .
Richard Glossip had problem with some the things , which I had said and had written .
He does not tell me , what I have to write , and I it would not do , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me at any time from his list of the witnesses .
But it wants that an international reporter is present , in order to write there .
If it dies , he thinks that the public work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell commodity , a reporter the hoof catching tone post office , will sit beside me .
If you want to know more about the case , hear please the series of Podcasts , which I made .
I do not want to die here all details .
I can not say with security that Richard Glossip is innocent .
Its actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make it guilty , a favouring of the act would be .
But I believe that a strong probability exists that it is not guilty of the murder .
I believe reliably that there are not sufficient proofs , in order to justify a death sentence .
I believe that its execution is wrong .
And from this perspective I will see it dying .
I can not state to be really objective .
It will give other reporters , whom you can contact for it .
Which you are gotten by me , is , which it is called to see dying a man an unnecessary death .

4 humans killed , after policemen rubber bullets shoot at demonstrators in Nepal
Four humans , under it a 4-year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police rubber bullets shot into a crowd , which demonstrated against the suggested new condition , said an official on Wednesday .
The force broke about 175 miles off on Tuesday evening in the district Rupandehi , to the west of the capital Kathmandu .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , leading district officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had met outside of a police station , whereby some from you stones and incendiary bombs threw .
Mr Dhakal said , the police had inserted and then into air had shot tear gas , before it fell back to rubber bullets .
20 police and five civilians were injured , said it .
It was not immediately clear , why the assigned rubber bullets , from which admits is that they can kill , which are used however traditionally as the less deadly alternative obviously a so high death rate produced .
The argument was the latter in weeks of violent protests in Nepal southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi said that new provinces , which are formed in the context of the suggested new condition would reduce their political influence .
There were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Tharus , which want their own state .
At least 40 humans , under it 11 police officer , became in violent arguments since 10 .
To divide August killed , when the four large political parties signed an agreement , the country in provinces - an important step toward a new condition , but a very disputed topic in Nepal , which was governed for many centuries central vision .
The work on a new condition is since 2008 on the way , but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake , which had killed thousands of humans in April .

The fact that now also Austria at its borders introduces again controls is for Pühringer “ a logical consequence ” from the action of the Germans .

The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestor of Donald Trump came from a place , whose inhabitant showoff is called .
This characteristic connects to some also with the billionaire , the US president will wants .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for exciters .
Whether he expresses himself xenophobic , journalists coarse concerns or reveals knowledge gaps in the international crisis politics - the applicant for the office for US president whirls up the election campaign strongly .
And fares well thereby .
That is registered also in the Palatinate Kallstadt , where grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate .
The New Yorker one with the foehn hair-style is many in the winegrower village at the wine route a term .
Some in the 1200-Einwohner-Ort is over - tens of corners to him is related .
Its grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinat : Donald Trump , here in the election campaign mode .
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel turned a film over Trump .
And which the villagers think of his goal , most powerful man of the world to become ?
“ I believe , those find that somehow exciting , am not however in their Kallstadter kind also so deeply impressive ” , say Simone Wendel .
The native Kallstädterin turned an amusing documentary film over the place and its famous offspring , among which beside Trump also the ketchup family Heinz ranks .
Trump , which does not admit for modesty is , comes into “ Kings OF Kallstadt ” ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that he would be probably also successful , if he would live in Kallstadt .
To the king of the hearts it did not bring it there .
Give it to respect for the achievement of the family , in addition , tendentious the opinion that Trump is “ already a little a bigmouth ” , says spiral .
Coincidentally read the nickname , which Kallstadt in the area has , “ the Brulljesmacher ” - to standard German : , it says the showoffs .
Trump comes thus from the village of the showoffs .
The Trump ' success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather emigrated and opened in the USA a restaurant for gold graves .
Foundation-stone of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York .
But the life of grandparents was not free from tragedy : Their desire to return in the long term to the homeland failed because of the Bavarian state , to which the Palatinat belonged at that time .
It does not have Trump taken up , because he is knocked off without approval once , the director of the institute for Palatinate history and folklore , Roland Paul , to film release had explained .
Trump is the grandchild of a “ illegal emigrant ” .
That stands in contrast to the every now and then marrowy statements of the descendant .
That had repetitive adversely spoken about Mexican immigrants in the USA and the building of a border wall had demanded , in order to deter illegal immigrants .
“ As , is not so pleasant that rumbles ” , says Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant related Trumps ( “ the granny was a born Trump , the Grandpa was born Heinz ” ) .
The winegrower in the retirement sees the American rather reserved , “ he is always like that flaring up ” .
Does he believe that Trump comes times ?
“ I can not present that ” , say myself to the 72-year old .
“ It never worried about Kallstadt ” .
The pension landlady Veronika Schramm mentions like some Kallstadter that a descendant of the family Heinz donated something with a visit for the church organ , which arrived generally well .
“ I can not present that from the Donald ” , say myself the 68-year old .
She would find it better , if he did not win the choice , because “ that has such radical opinions , I white not whether that is good ” .
If those , which had at present its grandfather in the USA a saying , had been like that like he , “ it would have there never arrived ” .
“ It gives more interesting topics than it ” , says winegrower daughter to Sarah Bühler .
And as a president ?
“ My president is it not ” , says her .
And : “ The clusters become ripe also without president Trump ” .
Wendels film , for which Trump was for a long time interviewed , to have 12,000 moviegoers seen , also in the USA awakes the interest .

Konrad in the search for 35.000 winterproof accomodation
Konrad has to do all hands with the refugee accommodation fully .
Christian Konrad is used to it that its word has weight .
The government used the earlier powerful Raiffeisen banker , in order to set up accomodation for the thousands the refugees .
The chaos in the Erstaufnahmezentrum Traiskirchen already got Konrad into the grasp .
“ We have no more homeless people in Traiskirchen ” , reported it of its first success .
Also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who had come on Monday to Austria , took place without large eddy , said Konrad and praised the organizational “ master achievement ” .
The ministry of the Interior spoke however of a “ crisis-charged situation ” .
Altogether Konrad counts on a need of 85.000 accomodation in this year 's year .
In order to fulfill the number , still 35,000 accommodation must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 is to make the countries , to 15,000 available the federation .
If it should become more refugees , we can create it .
“ However it is not a barrel without ground ” , said Konrad .
With the national main people it already held conversations .
These would have assured to it to create also still for the coming refugees accomodation .
“ In upper Austria it runs well ” , said Ferry Maier .
The former VP-authorized agent supports Konrad .
Tomorrow it will give a meeting with cardinal Christoph Schönborn , is to be clarified , how the church will help .
The asylum co-ordinator sets large expectations also into the ORF action “ helping as we ” .
On the platform private people can offer accommodation uncomplicatedly .
Besides one hopes for hotels , which stand in the winter empty .
Konrad and Maier criticized yesterday the standards for the accommodation as “ very highly ” .
In times of distress it can not be that accomodation givers must keep a certain height of the towel racks or size of the upperlight .
For a limited time “ emergency standards ” would have to be valid .
The fact that it is more successful with the accommodation contrary to the ministry of the Interior justifies Konrad with its experience .
I am an older gentleman , to who one does not say the untruth so easily in the face .
Persuasive power is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Maier do not cause costs for the republic , how they explained .
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
The own accomodation search was so far not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan place as office .
But there are obviously problems with approval .
Linz demands a better allocation
For the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as hint arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees plans the city Linz .
This is momentarily not necessarily , since one can accommodate the concerning at present without these measures , says mayors Klaus Luger ( FR ) .
For the emergency however further locations are to be checked for their fitness .
Criticism practices the city boss at the allocation of the refugees within the Federal state .
Also different districts must make their contribution here .

The sport functionaries would have charged only representational allowances and would have led the sport club out , for which they would have been active from 1982 to 2011 and would have invested into them much time and money , from the debts - liabilities amounted to in the year 2001 approximately 600,000 Schilling ( about 44,000 euros ) .

With all risks .
“ We advanced money , said our life insurances as security with the bank put down ” , it with the examination .
With the club one agreed upon : They can administer the money freely , it may only no debts be made .
Further - with appropriate financial - success the disbursement of the representational allowances was decided retroactively to 1991 .
Therefore one paid off a part of the representational allowances only years later , i.e . starting from the year 2003 , than a plus on the account was .
Therefore also overall and not seemed detail deductions up , described the former chairman the procedures .
The accounts and passbooks administered the two accused together , said the second accused .
Why the disbursements the club were not revealed in detail , the judge asked .
The club does not have itself in the detail in finances interested , important only the free from debtness was , so the answer .
When in the year 2011 against the one functionary investigations began because of office abuse , an amount was transferred by 120,000 euros to the club account .
That reserves were , explained the accused .
This securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not well-known according to its statement the club .
“ Why ? ” , the judge wanted to know .
Whereupon the asked one knew for a long time no answer .
Then he finally meant , he had believed that this is the best for the club .
If had somewhat happened to it , nobody would have known something from this money , placed the public prosecutor into the area .
The codefendant was informed , justified themselves the functionary .
This transfer was formulated as “ damage compensation ” .
Why damage amend ? , judge and public prosecutor wanted to know .
Whereupon the first accused , it explained had not agreed with this formulation , because never a damage developed for the club .
But which I am to do , if the lawyer says : “ Are with that you all off the hook ” .
“ Am I a legal representative ? ” , he asked .
Further the functionary , it said had never a cent content had referred , had charged it only kilometer money and diets .
At diets it charged for 1,000 euros per month to the club , was the actual expenditure however much more highly , added it .
Exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
These were not kept after an audit of operating results , in which everything was judged as correct , no more , explained them .
Kilometer money had referred also the second accused .
All recoveries took place in cash , in addition it had to drive from its residence people market to the bank to lead castle , explained it in its statement .

It demanded “ fewer theatres and more facts ” with this weekly event .
It has to leave also said that he can skip some meetings , in order it to colleagues .
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyns guidance , because it comes to its appointment as the member of the shadow cabinet and to its speech on the TUC annual convention on Tuesday .
In the meantime the decision of the labour chairman has , on Tuesday during singing the national anthem with a commemoration ceremony to 75 . Anniversary of the Battle OF Britain in silence to remain , provokes and is located criticism of a number of Tory MPs in the center of several title page Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyns decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention on itself
A spokesman of Mr Corbyn said , it would have “ in respectful silence confessed ” and it the “ heroism of Royal Air Force in the battle of britain ” had recognized .
But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told BBC in the Two Newsnight program , it the labour chairman guessed/advised to sing the national anthem “ independently ” of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished .
Nearly a dozen of shade Ministers refused serving in Mr Corbyns top team and it refer thereby to differences with the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less as a sixth of the parliamentary party originally than leaders supported it .
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences “ stack themselves ” also within labour after Mr Corbyns expressions for the position to the European union and delimitation with profits .
Mr Corbyn said to the TUC conference that labour submits changes , in order to remove the whole idea of a delimitation altogether .
Later Mr Smith , the shade work and pension Minister said hours that the party was “ very clear ” that it is only against the government plans to lower the delimitation from 26.000 £ to 23.000 £ .

It brought also the idea in the discussion that other colleagues seize occasionally the word , and that it John Bercow , whom spokesman of the House of Commons addressed , in order to discuss the problem .
When it became in the year 2005 leaders , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to depart from the policy in the style of a “ Punch theatre ” , which is linked often with the question time of the prime minister . But later it granted some years that he had failed therein .
Since it was on TV sent first in the year 1990 , the question time with the prime minister became as most important barometers of the judgement of a leader and its guidance in the House of Commons and its position among its parliament colleagues , although critics argued , it a caricature had become viewed and required extensive reforms .

The mourning procession passed by at the holy place , where only days before a construction crane by the cover of the mosque and then on the praying fell .

Exceptions for the new Bernrieder sports hall
The local council Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
And it made an exception .
The roof may become flatter for solar plant .
Planning for the long desired building of gymnasia at the Bernrieder sport area advances step by step : In the youngest session of the district council the prepared building application without large discussions was unanimously blessed .
Before the committee among other things still another request for a build-legal “ exception ” respectively “ liberation ” from the valid development plan had decided .
With the “ exception ” it went around permission for a special form concerning the roof structure .
Therefore a “ saddle roof with non-centric roofridge and roof projection ” is to be established .
Background of planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar plants : “ By it we get a marvelously large south roof together ” , explained mayors Josef Steigenberger in the meeting .
During the “ liberation ” it concerned again the roof pitch , which was to be for energetic reasons - differently than prescribed in the development plan - below ten degrees .
The volume of the hall is reduced clearly thereby .
A “ liberation ” became necessary , because the development plan does not permit “ exceptions ” concerning the roof pitch - whereby the Bernrieder local council usually proceeds with petitions for liberation rather restrictively .
With the building of gymnasia it concerns however no recurring project : “ We create thereby no precedent ” , thus Steigenberger .
The building of gymnasia at the sports center is a community project of the community and the SV Bernried .
At costs are euros taken into account approximately 2.3 million .
Subsidies are expected by the school and popular sport promotion .
In the next process step the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is submitted now to the district administration office for examination .

Decoration instead of curtain - Plauener point as fashion niche
In former times it concerned to make meters at the long embroidery machines into and over to Plauen .
The embroidered materials and points developed in large quantity for customers , who processed them for example to covers and curtains .
Alone functioned today the no more , does not explain Andreas Reinhardt , Geschäftsführer of the fashion point Plauen .
Instead the fashion is again important .
In the start times of the Plauener point fashion played a larger role , then by the home textile industry displaced - and now than niche is rediscovered .
Reinhardt calls some examples : Point in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional traditional costumes .
At all form the so-called Vintage fashion , which follows past style epochs , an increasing order potential .
Who does not serve niches in the textile trade in Germany , no more is not at the market .
With us they already constitute half of all orders .
Fashion point Plauen is together with nine further enterprises member in the branch federation Plauener point and embroideries .
Only they may carry the protected label .
In the last 15 years are approximately 80 percent of the revenue broken off .
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale are not there nearly any longer .
Our products reach the customer in this way hardly still .
The mass-produced goods are many more cheaply manufactured nowadays in the Asian area and driven out almost exclusively over chains .
In addition slack off the export , up-to-date to Russia and into the USA .
Sufficient reasons thus for new ways .
The branch federation tries to score also by environmental awareness , as Cordula Bauer of the stick bead in Falkenstein explains : “ For this year we lead a quality seal , which shows that we produce ecologically and social action compatibly ” .
Reinhardt supplements : “ Refers also to the used materials ” .
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch office of the westSaxon university Zwickau - at the faculty for applied art - and is specialized in embroideries and points .
In order to oppose to the competition from the Asian area something , one must find high-quality and innovative products .
That needs time and courage .
Develops an area of conflict between the freshest ideas of the designers and the enterprises , which must think above all economically ” , say Schmidt .
Therefore an existing design often only slightly one vary , in order to hold a customer master .
Some years ago textile designer Kati Reuter encouraged the historical snowball point again .
The machine in some places small balls stickt .
The Plauener goldsmith champion Bianca Hallebach-Krauße let itself inspire of it : “ Before I could not begin anything with traditional Plauener point ” .
Now it uses the snowball point for her jewelry .
In a complex procedure it coins the sample in silver .
“ Many humans of the region identify themselves with the topic Plauener point - young and old ” , Reuter says .
It supplies also to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - particularly at customers , whose ancestor in Plauen and environment lived and which would like a piece of memory .
With it I see jewelry meaning as a modern Ambassador of the Plauener point .

European Union wants to double mercury limit in robbery fish
The European commission wants the limits for mercury in large robbery fish to double and to the consumers thereby a clearly higher dose of the nerve poison expect .
The consumer association Foodwatch , which is present an appropriate paper of the European Union , criticized the plans sharply : “ Risks and side effects of missed industrie and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant woman and infants ” , explained Matthias Wolfschmidt von Foodwatch .
According to Wolfschmidt the limits of the nerve poison for large fish are to be raised in the end the food chain as for instance shark or sword fish for “ politico-economic reasons ” of one to two milligrams mercury per kilogram fish .
Large robbery fish are however already today so strongly burdening with mercury that on basis of the still valid limits about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold .
After duplication of the limits then only 14.5 percent would be unsalable .
In response for this loosening the European Union wants to intensify the limits according to Foodwatch with other fish from at present 0.5 milligrams on 0,1 milligrams mercury per kilogram .
Foodwatch called this however “ trick ” , because smaller Friedfi is usually so low burdening , as for instance carps that they keep the planned maximum values already today .
The sinking with small fish is therefore “ a perfidious diverting manoeuvre , which helps alone the economy ” , explained Wolfschmidt .
Mercury is a heavy metal high-poisonous for humans , which enriches itself over the food chain particularly in robbery fish strongly .
The Federal Government warns therefore of the fact that “ already small quantities can particularly cause with unborn damages of the nervous system ” .
The Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage regarding the valid maximum values however that a “ health endangerment of the population of general ” is not to be expected .
Mercury arrives particularly by coal combustion into the environment .
The German coal-fired power stations discharge than six tons mercury according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Represenative of the Green Party in the parliament Annalena Baerbock more in the year , two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany .
The concentration of mercury in fish for instance in Elbe , Rhine and Danube is “ permanently and surface covering exceeded ” , the “ mirror ” in March of the paper had quoted .
Last year European-wide warnings of mercury in fish already ranked among the most frequent announced health risks in the European Union-warning system RASFF .

The enterprise said that it expects nevertheless that the result will increase in relation to the previous year due to reduction of costs , higher incomes and because of growth in the online commerce .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the enterprise furnishes “ solid yields , if one considers those more weakly than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade , ” .
The plans for the holidays occupation were announced one day later than those of the rival UPS , which plans , to 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers , for instance the same number as in the last year to adjust .

But boom in online shopping the results at Fedex Ground increased .
In the last quarter the revenue rose with ground transport by 29 percent , but the operational result was flat in the reason because of higher costs of larger packages and self-insurance .

Lamb was important it to stress that its “ sweet dog ” however still lives and was probably excited , and it said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
Within the house the officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a hand written note , which were scratched on a white block : “ Me it does to suffering , I in such a way wanted , I could cancel it , I loved Amy and her am the only woman , who ever loved me ” . This stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed of Lamb .
It gave no reference that Lamb , which informed in two online courses for the delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had traveled already 300 miles to the campus , where he shot and killed popular historical professor , according to the police Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police head Lynn Buford said that university employees heard a shooting around 10:18 clock .
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime thereafter .
Up to the end of the day there was a further death : Lamb took itself the life , when the police encircled it .
The authorities try one day after the shooting in the university , which students and lecturers forced to hide itself behind closed doors still to provide a picture of it which Lamb motivated .
Details , like also published by the investigators at both ends of the state , what students and employees , who could do it , stated , helped thereby , a picture of a talented to possibly draw but difficult teachers .
Students said that they looked forward to its instruction .
The police in gau animal , where Prentiss died , said , it did not have history of the force or a criminal prehistory .
Schmidt Lamb in a book written by it had mentioned , in which he mentioned “ marvelous humans ” , with which it its academic life divided .
Both informed in the department for social sciences and history , whose faculty covers 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
At the same time there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors .
A student , Brandon Beavers , who praised Lamb , said , he seemed also a little excited and nervous , “ as if something with him is wrong . ”
Another student , Mikel Sykes , said that lamb had told him that he had to do in the end the academic year 2014-15 with stress .
Lamb had asked and with the fact had said the delta State University before for a leave for health reasons that he had any health problem .
In this year it informed only two online courses .
Newest changes in employment policy university meant that the graduation , for which Lamb had so hard worked for it would not represent a warranty for an automatic way to an employment as a Assistant professor .
University University of William LaForge said , it did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but “ it naturally gave somewhat in Mr Lambs conception . ”
Those are questions , which Lamb can not answer any longer .
After the escape from the campus the police of late Lambs trace found , when it brought in again in Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before it could be arrested , Lamb killed along,38 calibers of pistol in the backyard of a house for instance a mile south its parents ' house on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said themselves Washington County coroner Methel Johnson .
Its car still ran in the entry .
It was not immediately clear , why lamb went to this house , but said Johnson that she believes that it knew the people , which lived there .
Lamb buildup in the area .
Lamb began 2009 its work on the University of , the 3,500 students in a city with approximately 12,000 inhabitants has and informed geography and pedagogy .
It attained a doctorate in the spring in pedagogy .
One of the friends of many years Lambs called it intelligently , charismatic and hilariously .
Carla Hairston said , her was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met by common friends .
They and their friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older chap , who tried some years to teach to her the guitar play .
It was at that time the woman swarm .
All girls melted away , if he were there ” , said Hairston , now 40 and in Jackson Vorstadt 's von Brandon resident .
Lamb and Prentiss were together obviously some time .
In the emergency call Lamb “ I said my wife killed ” , but there was no document of a marriage .
They had a dog named Lightning , which lived with them in the brick house , which borders on a Bayou in gau animal .
The police said that the dog was correct .
The ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn O'Stehen , said , they were before 15 years became divorced , but friends had remained and a daughter had , who was now 19 years old .
“ You ” , said O'Stehen was totally at the ground destroyed about its daughter .
They and their mother were absolutely best friends .
O'Stehen said , he had never met Lamb , but by its daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Prentiss , when he and Abigail before three years both on a summer fair arose .
Later they played together or other Gig .
O'Stehen said , its daughter writes and sings its own music .
Prentiss was a nurse , who worked for different enterprises online .
Mike Shaffer , a bartender and sometimes maintenance co-ordinator with The Julep Room , a weakly lit up bar in close proximity to gau animal , said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at the night 5 September for the last time , after Lamb had terminated his guitar and harmonica play terminated before a meager audience .
There were no signs for the fact that did not tune something .
“ , He said simple only one happy couple ” .
We were at clearing up and joked with one another .
I mean , her had both a good sense for jokes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the frosh seminar program and specialized in native Americans and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
It was married and had three small children .
It studied to the Emporia State University in Kansas and was a president its brother shank and the student committee .
On the delta State campuses in Cleveland participated Tuesday evening about 900 humans , including lecturers , employees , students and members of the community in a candle light commemoration ceremony .
Schmidts Mrs. Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated likewise in the memorial vigil , while the university University of “ Bright Morning star ” and “ Amazing Grace ” sang .
Instruction is again taken up on Wednesday .
“ We try to induce our students to the return ” , said LaForge .
The crisis is past .
This is one day of the healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Of Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in new Orleans contributed to this report .
This history was corrected , in order to against-reflect the fact that the police says now that Lamb made the emergency call , after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in its emergency call called Prentiss its wife , but a reference to it does not give it that the two ever married .

Metcash starts nativeness campaign for the fight against Aldi idea
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches against a Aldi marching-up in South Australia and western Australia .
Food wholesale dealer Metcash started a nativeness campaign , in order to defend the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and western Australia before 700 million a $ Aldi invasion .
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and western Australia at the beginning of next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets their relations strengthen with local food suppliers and develop the brand IGA by mainstream marketing and marketing over the social media , just as over event as Adelaide show .
IGA resellers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer Simmo out of Dunsborough , that in IGA shops samples distributed and shopkeepers , which sell reduced in price tickets for the South Australian football league to faithful customers .
It is expected that Metcash publishes further details of its defense strategy on 29 September , if the wholesale dealer for food , alcohol and devices accomplishes his annual investor strategy day .
It stands much on the play , since South Australia and western Australia constitute nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA Ladengeschäften and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the east states .
Buyers in South Australia and western Australia are notoriously provincially and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share as in new South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in western Australia compared with approximately 14 percent in the east states .
However analysts believe such as Morgan Stanley that Aldi will snap twelve months after opening of its first markets approximately five percent of the food product market in these two states and all existing participants , but mainly independent retailers of sales will take away .
According to this week published report the analyst estimated Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers could lose 360 $ millions revenue per year and Metcash 250 million $ to end of 2016 .
This prognosis is based on the acceptance that Aldi will obtain in the next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA open and a revenue of 500 million $ and 600 million $ in each market .
The loss in the food and grocer 's shop and with the quantities on Metcashs of high fixed costs basis could to Metcash approximately 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes cost , said Mr Kierath .
At the same time Metcash loses market shares in the east states , mainly at Aldi and Coles , although a recently accomplished survey of Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs revenue will fall in the food and grocer 's shop by 3,8 percent in the year 2016 , by 4,1 percent in the year 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in the year 2015 to 10,3 percent to 2020 will reduce .
Last week told the prominent fund manager Hamish Douglass , the founder Magellan Financial Group , with a business meal in Melbourne that Metcash probably within one decade . Metcash will disappear .
Metcash rejected it to react publicly to the comments of Mr Douglass .
But one assumes a member of the board of Metcash with Mr Douglass took up last week contact .
IGAs market share sank since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent , and an income from Metcashs food and food trade , which supply about 1,200 IGA retailers , is since 2012 around 43 percent please , what with simultaneous pressure on revenue and margins reflects the operational reduction of debts .
The wholesale dealer resists however and invests more than 150 million $ , in order to adapt and improve IGA retailers with the improvement of their shops by faster growing fresh food to selling price with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products each week and to supply a better selection at private label food .
Metcashs managing director Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop schemes of reconstruction at energy will add and hope that the wholesale dealer will return in the year 2017 for the first time in four years again to a profit growth .

Robot car : Government wants role of the pioneer for Germany
Germany is to be after the will of the Federal Government with the change of the car of technological outriders .
The Federal Cabinet decided a strategy document from the house of transport minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) on Wednesday , who plans among other things investments into the development of digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the car fair IAA of a “ new mobility age ” .
Automated and interlaced driving will increase the road safety and for less back-up provide , said Dobrindt .
He wants to discuss the topic also with his colleagues from the G7-Staaten , which meets on the IAA also with representatives the industry .
The strategy document of the Ministry of Transport stresses among other things the meaning of the mobile broadband development and a brisk Umstiegs on digital sound broadcasting .
For the testing of new technology at present a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria develops .
Thus the driver “ to be put on ” , the Federal Government the legal basic conditions does not want to examine additional liability risks “ and , where necessary , to which new developments adapt ” .
So Germany wants to use itself about internationally for the fact that the permissible maximum speed for self-propelled cars is raised of 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
The Federal Government wants to support in addition a change of the vienna convention , which plans so far only humans as a driver .
During automated driving increasingly the car takes over the guidance , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
The technology is based particularly on sensors and cameras , which seize the environment and which data process within seconds .
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs high-automated driving on motorways until 2020 will be technically possible .
Nevertheless vehicles without driver on public roads are “ only far after 2020 to expect ” .
The authors of the study estimate the creation of value within the range of the Fahrerassistenzsysteme and the high-automated driving functions at Germany for 2025 on approximately 8.4 billion euros .
“ The digital networking of the car can lead to more security and efficiency in the traffic ” , said the SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol .
The question of the liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified however .
Still the Germans see self-propelled cars however sceptically - to much more than Frenchmen or Americans .
On Wednesday on the AA submitted survey of the Forsa institute on behalf the test organization Dekra it comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomously driving cars will become generally accepted in the coming ten years , to 32 percent count only in 20 years thereby , 31 percent believe not at all in it .
In France count 21 percent of the asked ones until 2025 on autonomously driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
Anyway the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle .
After a collection of the digital federation Bitkom only seven percent would agree to deliver control during the entire trip on all roads .
On the motorway could in flowing traffic nevertheless the 15 percent imagine , in the back-up 45 percent .
Well each fourth was left to the car control under no circumstances .

Wahl-2016 : Hillary Clintons 's lead over Bernie Sanders in national survey halves
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds further a two digit lead in democratic running around the nomination on a national level , but senator Bernie Sanders gains it opposite ground .
Clinton has now the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters with the primaries ( 58 percent before ) , while Sanders in second place stands , with 27 percent ( rise around 17 percent ) .
Vice-president Joe Biden , who did not announce yet , whether he stands as a candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the primaries .
More than five months before beginning of the primaries to say say most democratic voters that it is too early , in order that their opinion is certain , which candidates it will support .
But Clintons supporters are steadier in their choice than those of the other candidates .
Since the CBS news survey has Clinton with a set of demographic groups lost , while Sanders obtained some profits .
Clinton holds a large lead with women and self-control , but these leads were reduced .
Their support with the men sank clearly , and Sanders is past here only with 5 points .
Clintons advantage with democratic voters under 50 years evaporated , and they and Sanders now are on same height .
Clinton has however still another large lead with the older voters .
In the past month Clinton was forwards Sanders with two digit lead with the liberals , but has Sanders now a lead of point of 5 at this group .
Say about half of the democratic voters of the primaries country-wide that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , if them were nominated by the party .
A quarter would support it with some reservations and would only support further 15 percent it , because she is the candidate .
They would not support six percent .
Perhaps not surprising that Clintons current supporters are enthusiastic by it particularly .
The opinions are more strongly mixed with those , which do not support at present Clinton - only about a quarter them enthusiastically to support .
While it says 48 percent of the democratic voters of the primaries that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , says less republican voters this about her leading candidate Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
If Clintons supporters in an open question are asked , why it is to want that she is the candidate , the most frequent answer that she has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed from the opinion that it is time that a Mrs. Präsidentin becomes ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
By Clintons supporters also its connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is mentioned .
Agreement to handling the problems and the eligibility are also quoted .
Since the vice-president throws a potential for the presidential office into the scale pan , it would like 57 percent of the democratic voters of the primaries it in running to see - although a third believes that it should not do it .
If democratic voters of the primaries are asked , who for the party its second choice would be , is Biden at the point .
Of Clintons supporters more than half say that Biden would be far their second choice forwards Sanders .
If Biden decides not to stand as a candidate for the nomination of the democrats Hillary Clintons 's lead increases forwards Sanders , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in running .
Fifty-five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the choice ; however this number of 78 percent sank in the last month .
Biden is with distance second when this measurement , but the percentage , which views him as the “ most selectable ” , rose .
Nevertheless , with the question about it , which is more important with a candidate , democratic voters call questions over the eligibility .
Similarly as in the last month not one democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the primaries stands out as unacceptable .
The democratic candidates or potential candidate furnish good results with some important characteristics with voters of the primaries of their party .
Majorities regard Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities equipped .
Biden cuts with the three candidates best off with honesty , while Clintons strength is the guidance .
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say over the Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have in addition no opinion of it .
Democratic voters of the primaries see generally also Clinton , Sanders and Biden ideologically in agreement with their opinions .
When all these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters does not have an opinion of Sanders .
Since questions are further placed to Hillary Clintons 's use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as a Foreign Minister , most democratic voters of the primaries are content with their explanation of the affair and to say that it did not affect its opinions altogether .
But it is another history in the American public altogether .
Half of the Americans is now dissatisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is content .
The public opinion for this was split in March , briefly after the problem came to the light .
Most Americans said the fact that the email controversy did not have effects on its general opinions of Clinton although said 36 percent that its opinion of it had still worsened .
There is mainly republicans , more than six of 10 , which says that its opinions of Clinton became worse .
Although Clinton is viewed of the voters of its party as honest and trustworthily , this is further a problem for it among registered voters altogether : Only 32 percent they see as honestly and trustworthily , to eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less for May .
They do not regard 62 percent of the voters as an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time country-wide also Trump do not view 55 percent of the voters as honestly and not trustworthily .
Clinton and Trump receive however good notes with guidance .
From the six tested candidates fare Biden , Carson and Bush best with honesty .
A majority views Sanders rather as honest , but as with Carson have many no opinion of it .
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters with the primaries amounts to 6 percentage points .

European Commission suggests new court in controversy over TTIP
For defusing the controversy over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP the European Commission suggested an extensive reform of the current arbitral tribunal system .
The disputed private conciliation facilities for disputes between companies and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to traditional courts in its function mode clearly more .
“ We want to furnish a system , which the citizens trust , explained ” the responsible European Union-commissioners Cecilia Malmström with the conception .
The Swede intends to bring the proposal as European negotiating position into the free trade discussions with the USA .
The German government announced support .
From TTIP the largest foreign trade zone of the world with 800 millions of people is to result .

It would permit it to raise against judgements objection .
So far among themselves the procedure-taken part did not agree on arbitrator , an objection possibility against their judgements gave it .
In the discussion of the past months that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in things fairness and justice , commentated Malmström became clear .
On a long-term basis she wants to work towards according to their own statements on an international investment court .
There then for example also disputes between Chinese enterprises and European Union member states could be clarified .
The investor state States of ( ISDS ) , particularly required by large concerns , are considered as one of the principal reasons for the large resistance in Europe against TTIP .
The traditional arbitral tribunals by opponents as a kind parallel law criticized , over which enterprises compensation firstride debited to the taxpayers , national laws to circumvent or a lowering of consumer and environmental standards to implement can .
In first statements anti TTIP organizations called such as Campact the proposals of the European Commission insufficient .
It was criticized above all that they are not to be valid for the free trade agreement with Canada ( Ceta ) , already negotiated .
The German economic Secretary of State Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) called the plans however large progress .
The commission considers substantial points , which Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel compiled in the spring with other European Union-Ministers of Trade with the reform .
The old system from private arbitral tribunals is from the table .
Also the French government welcomed the plans of Malmström .
The European enterprise federation BusinessEurope warned to limit the complaint possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by it , it were said .
When the discussions can be concluded over the free trade agreement TTIP ( Transatlantic trade and investment Partnership ) , remained on Wednesday further unclearly .
The negotiations run since in the middle of 2013 .
The topic investor protection was so far however not discussed with the USA .
Originally a framework should already stand for end of this year for the agreement .
This date is not considered as any longer durable .

The situation on the German housing market is strained .
Also more and more refugees look for a payable lodging .
The pressure on the housing market grows .
The social housing construction stands before a challenge .
The resource allocation conflicts on the German housing market began for a long time .
With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the European Union urge more and more humans on a market , which is overloaded in many large cities already .
They compete with low-income citizens around the last payable apartments .
In order to cover the demand for payable apartments , 400,000 new units would have to be built until 2020 each year .
To this result a study comes on behalf the federation alliance “ social housing construction ” .
To the comparison : In this year 260,000 units become finished in Germany .
Thus 140,000 apartments are missing .
Refugees are no longer obligated after the first three months of their stay to live than asylum-seekers in a Erstaufnahmeunterkunft .
Many encounter then the housing market and join the long queues before the rented flats .
According to Federal Statistical Office lived in the last year however less than half of all asylum seekers to the rent .
The negative development of the housing market is not however only because of the rising refugee numbers .
The study constitutes also substantial omissions in the housing policy of the last years .
Germany moves a housing shortage over before itself , which becomes larger from year to year .
Up-to-date already approximately 770,000 housing units were missing , deplore Matthias Günther , Autor of the study in the densely populated areas .
Many working persons lived therefore in large cities perforce in WG-rooms .
Young adults remained involuntarily longer because of the calm air on the housing market in the “ hotel mummy ” .

“ Children come ever more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands goes in provisional accommodation ” , said Lopez CNN .
He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally , during some it does , over their friends to impress or because of a test of courage with the social media .
Videos on YouTube show , how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience .
Youth mixed allegedly disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash , in order to receive a harder beverage .
Younger children can be attracted by attractive smells of the disinfectants .
“ A child does not think that this is bad for it ” , said Lopez .
Many the more attractive ( hand disinfectant ) are those , which are perfumed .
There are disinfectants with Erdbeer , grape and orange smell , which are responding for children much .
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
Particularly with infants few splashes can lead to the alcoholic poisoning .
“ It is most concentrated alcohol ” , told Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the poison emergency call center in the hospital of the university of Kansas , the transmitter Fox 4 in Kansa town center .
Thus , you would not let a sip whisky stand around , but these hand disinfectants in range of children leave to humans , and if children come to it , then it is a fast possibility of consuming much alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year girl , who had at school taken recently four splashes of hand disinfectant smelling after strawberry , was brought into a provisional accommodation to the treatment .
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice more highly as the threshold , which is valid with an adult legally than drunk , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , a provisional accommodation physician , who treated it in the Gwinnett Medical center outside from Atlanta .
Nhaijah lallte their words and was not in the situation to be gone , when she arrived in provisional accommodation .
Physicians supervised it over night in a separate children 's hospital on signs of cerebral trauma , since the girl was fallen by the alcohol and had pushed the head , said Ritchey .
“ That was much frightening ” , said Ortoria Scott , Nhaijahs mother , CNN .
It could have been deadly for my child .
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfection cloths and to store hand disinfectants outside of the range of the child .
Beyond alcoholic poisoning some disinfectants were connected with deaths .
In the year 2013 two women in Ontario died women after swallowing hand disinfectants , which contained a toxic , not defined ingredient .
Employees of health authorities assume that the product contained methanol , a deadly solution , instead of ethyl alcohol , which was noted as active substance .
In January three pupils of the fourth class in the state planned New York to poison their “ common ” teacher by laying antibacterial products out approximately around the classroom ” , then it announces a police report .
The teacher is high-grade allergically against hand disinfectants and banished her from her area .

The Federal Constitutional Court gave Tegel quite , which was accommodated for months in a too small cell to a ex-prisoner of the penal institution .
Because of the injury of their human dignity prisoners have in principle requirement on financial compensation , if they are accommodated in too small cells .
That decided the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday published resolution .
The concerning can hope according to the judges even for money if they only few days were locked up in to close areas ( Az . : 1 BvR 1127/14 ) .
Thus a ex-prisoner was successful with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : It was accommodated in the penal institution Berlin Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spatially not separated .
Afterwards the man , who is according to its lawyer meanwhile free foot , had been moved into a larger cell .

Di Maria meets , in order to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö .
Di Maria meets with its debut in the champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by at Malmö .
Here are the play report and the reaction to the play .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course , when Paris Saint Germain started its champions League season with extremely comfortable 2-0 a victory against Malmö in the prince park stadium on Tuesday .
Di Maria met less as four minutes after the start of its champion League debut than PSG player , who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards missed it a set of opportunities , before they increased finally their lead , than Cavani in the 61 . Minute a headed goal obtained .
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in the group of A needs of Paris a strong start against the Swedish master , there it not only the qualification for the K.O . - Rounds aim at , but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in everyone of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a class play opportunities before the gate , missed by Laurent Blancs 's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics . It was replaced later in the play against its hometown team and against the club , with which he already began his illustrious career in the year 1999 .
“ It is not simple to win at home or outward in the champions League . Therefore it is a good start to win 2:0 to cause for our opponents of problems and relaxed look back , even if there are certain things , which we must still perfect in the course of the season ” , said Blanc .
“ That is a good sign .
We wanted to win and have we won , although I regret it that we still did not obtain or two further gates . ”
Ibrahimovic returned to its injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which on the weekend a 2:2 standoff could hold on own place against Bordeaux in first division , but it was outdone in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
Argentine wing striker the man it was called who can carry PSG forward on the next stage in Europe , when he was transferred in the last month of Manchester United , and he suggested , why , when he ran in Marco Verrattis 's passport behind the Malmö defense , before he locked beautifully past at Johan Wiland into the long corner of the net .
If however someone believed that PSG would obtain a large victory , that was disappointed .
Malmö , which struck Celtic in a play-off , in order to reach this stage , began with Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was deeply in the centre zone lined up with a five-man defense and two a heavy opponent .
But except a shot of Nikola Djurdjic , that far at Kevin Trapps 's posts in the 34 . Minute passed , offered it little in the attack .
Sometimes instead PSG gave itself up , with some bad passes and bad conclusions , not least from Ibrahimovic , which blundered with not less than five attempts alone in the first half and was given up then , after Cavani had used him after the restart .
Nevertheless it proved much more fate , if he brought his fellow players in the play , and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic , which Di Maria transformed into a turning shot , which of Wiland in the 52 . Minute at the post was by-steered…
The second gate fell finally shortly after the hourly brand owing to Cavani . The Uruguayer obtained thereby its sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had up-fished a left flank of Maxwell .
The terminated all thought to the fact that Malmö can return to the play , and only a outstanding intervention of Wiland from shortest distance , in order to stop David Luiz could the final result low keep , before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi a gate was in the end denied .
The coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , admitted later that PSG played a class over its team , and the Norwegian said : “ Our the latter championsleague play was in December in the last year .
Since then we played only in the Swedish league , which does not have the same level .
The qualification plays are not sufficient . ”
Hat off before Paris !
It was a great play of them !

That Viktor Orbán sends now further thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
Instead of helping in the camp Röszke immediately with the establishment from structures to , which ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor high-officially and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government into the vapor circle of the national socialism moved .
Suffering-basic of this politics are not only those Austrians , who are confronted with chaotic conditions now in the border areas .
Also the fleeing will realize that the “ promised land ” , which invited and was called them welcome nothing when a further refugee camp is .
It will become a large challenge , in view of the continuous streams of refugees and the approaching winter to manufacture with us humane conditions for protection-looking for .
And it will be still larger - peace to maintain security and stability in Austria .

Who smokes , a higher risk has to lose teeth
Who smokes , harms thereby not only the lung , but also the teeth - a Potsdamer suggests long-term study .
The good message : With renouncement the risk sinks fast .
Smokers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
That comes out from the long-term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German institute for nutrition research ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
Compared with nonsmokers the risk lay to lose their teeth prematurely around the 2.5 - to 3,6-Fache more highly with smokers .
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants .
Main causes for tooth loss are caries and inflammations of the gums , stress the DIfE .
For this Periodontitis smoking is a factor of risk , stresses the authors .
The connection between smoking and tooth loss decreases from there to more frequent gingivitises with smokers .
It is not clarified to what extent smoking increases also the risk for caries .
Humans , who stopped with smoking , could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the “ journal OF Dental Research ” .
It can last however over ten years , until the endangerment sinks the level of nonsmokers , explained Erstautor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
One must convince humans to become nonsmokers explained directors of studies Heiner Boeing of the DIfE : “ Smoking shortens the lifetime . ”
Not to smoke is good for lung and containers and leads after our realizations also to a good dental health in the great age .
In Germany the DIfE is concerned over 20 percent of the population in the age from 65 to 74 years of toothlessness , communicated .
Earlier investigations would have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk for early tooth loss .
The new long-term study supports the findings .

Experts criticize report of Public Health England over E-cigarettes
Statements of a state-funded agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than a smoking developed from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
Experts , who write in British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , followed Lancet , by criticizing the proofs used by Public Health England ( PHE ) in their report over e-cigarettes .
PHE published the “ fundamental report ” in the past month and describes it as a “ comprehensive examination of the proofs ” .
But some researchers placed and referred the maximum stress of the data in question to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
A editorial in the medical technical periodical Lancet last month attacked the “ extraordinarily windy basis ” , on which PHE justified its most important conclusion .
Two further researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the statements develop “ on stone or sand ” .
Martin McKee , professor for European Öffentlichde health to London School OF hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell , professor for clinical epidemiology at the University OF Liverpool , said : “ A basic principle of the public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of the effectiveness . ”
They said the fact that the public expects that the statement of PHE that “ the present best estimation is that E-cigarettes are less harmful about 95 % than a smoking ” on a detailed examination of the proofs and is based to the modelling .
Indeed this statement comes from only one meeting of 12 people , who became to call up to lead in order to develop a model for a multiple criterion decision analysis ( multi-criteria Decision analysis - MCDA ) , in order their opinions across the damage from different nicotine haltigen products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Capewell said the fact that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health , whose managing director was before to have received means ( ASKED ) for an independent study from British American Tobacco .
He signed also the references of ASKED to the public health in a sustainability report , said her .
One of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive means from a E-cigarette-manufacturer to but they did not add the financing , which it was to have received after reports before from the tobacco enterprise Philip Morris International .
The reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but in addition several well-known E-cigarette-champions belong , from whom some also in the paper indicate a branch financing .
Some other participants in this meeting are not admit for their know-how in tobacco control .
In the meeting participated also the tobacco line of PHE .
The research work of the group “ confesses characteristically ” that there is a lack of “ hard proofs for the damage of most products with most criteria ” , wrote McKee and Capewell .
However none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report is discussed .
McKee and Capewell said that the statements of PHE that “ there are so far no proofs that E-cigarettes serve as a way to smoking for children or nonsmokers ” prematurely were .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director for health and well-being with PHE , said that to the statements of BMJ one reacted already before .
He said : “ E-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than a smoking . ”
Each second lifelong smoker dies at his craze .
All proofs put near that the health risks of E-cigarettes are small in the comparison to it , but that we have to study further the long-term effects .
PHE has the clear obligation for the information of the public about what the proof occupies and which not , above all , if there is public confusion so much over the relative dangers in the comparison to the tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 humans die annually at an illness with reference to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year .
By the clear presentation of current proofs that E-cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage , which is caused by smoking , fulfill we represent our national responsibility .

FC arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team colleagues before the play must stand against direct current generator Zagreb behind injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed opposite Wilshere that it was only September and if its rehablitation runs after plan it no reason gives , why he can play not before Christmas again .
This optimistic scenario means already that Wilshere will miss the next four plays for England surely at least and in view of its history is its participation in the next summer at the European championship surely still uncertainly .
The large dishonor for this current problem is that Wilshere had strongly terminated the last season after a separate ankle injury and then again to its old momentum during the preseason had found the way back .
“ This kind threatened by injury the career ” , did not say Wenger .
It is a bone , which did not heal well .
That is not a larger affair .
This was only one accident .
It was not located in connection with its ankles or with the injuries , which it had before .
That may be true from purely medical view , but like Wenger , gives it also recognized the associated danger of further injuries , every time a player tries to return in the middle in the season .
Also an unpleasant sample develops .
The investigation of Prime Minister Injuries Ltd. registers 23 different illnesses of Wilshere since its debut before six years .
It played also in only 65 of arsenal 157 league plays in the last five play times .
The broader picture for arsenal is that they were in six of eight play times since 2007/08 one of the two Prime Minister League clubs , which have to register most injury days .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but arsenal believes that an improvement will persist with the injury ratio during the last season .
“ Sometimes , if you return from an injury , have a susceptible period , a time , in which you must strengthen your body and win combat capability ” , said Wenger .
Jack is young enough , in order to overcome .
I hope , its body stabilize , I am confident that he will do it and it will go through a career of the kind , which he earns .
Arsenal begins its championsleague season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the plays against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on coming Wednesday , and Wenger stops itself a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta might start .
Wenger can begin also with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
“ I try to hold and the players , who need it , a small breather grant the balance ” , said Wenger .
Although arsenal clear favorites are to get ahead by group of F the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playgrounds with the largest intimidation effect in Europe .
Direct current generator is also unbeaten after 41 plays , after “ invincibly ” the campaign was started in the last season .
The stadium was shaken Tuesday evening by an earthquake , whereby on the judge scale 3.2 were measured .
This year was it 10. in Zagreb .
Wenger is the opinion the fact that arsenal drew the teachings from the past season with the championsleague surrender against Monaco and remains of far hope floated to lead with its management the club to its first European Cup Triumph .
“ This drive is immense ” , said Wenger .
It did not fold with arsenal ever .
We were very close in the year 2006 to it , but on the other side I am for a long time enough in the business , in order to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .

Angela Merkel and the refugee politics : “ We create ”
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - which is a Federal Chancellor decided to accept her .
What comes to Germany ?
Approximately 800,000 asylum seekers will come to prognoses of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in this year to Germany , to statement of vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) are Germany even in the layer , one million refugees to be taken up .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge determination : “ I say again and again : We can create that , and we create ” .
Which comes to Germany , mediate the following overview .
Are used after different prognoses between 350000 ( estimation of the Federal Department of Construction ) and 400000 ( estimation the Pestel institute ) apartments annually - the next five years long .
That is nearly twice as much , as before is built ( 250000 apartments ) .
Dramatic the lack of dwelling is however particularly with payable renting objects : Falls out annually 60000 to 80000 subsidized low-rent housings of rent control , and around these particularly favorable apartments also refugees will apply .
Federal Secretary of Construction Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) wants to therefore double the promotion , from at present 518 million on a billion euro .
Much too little is from view of the Pestel institute : 80,000 subsidized low-rent housings annually would have to develop and but would have the federation a promotion at a value of 6.4 billion per year to invest .
United itself scientists and Federal Secretary of Construction are in the fact that it must give in addition more tax benefits for investments to housebuilding .
According to estimations of the institute for job market and occupation research is to be assumed on a long-term basis 55 percent of the fleeing in Germany can be gainfully employed .
However the refugees in Germany were not asked at all systematically for their qualification , in order to help them with the entrance , criticize Claudia Walter , Projektmanagerin for integration and education in the Bertelsmann foundation .
For the integration of refugees it is however crucial whether they find in Germany work .
Work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission company , in addition , for the self-esteem of the immigrants , migration researcher says Dietrich Thränhardt .
In Germany it gave a political turn according to Thränhardt : of the work prohibition for refugees for the acknowledgment of work .
While there was in former times a work prohibition for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , just as the residence obligation , which limits asylum seekers to a residence .
In the society - also because of the lack of specialist - by the majority the aspect became generally accepted that faster the entrance to the job market should be made possible for refugees .
A large hurdle for the entrance to the job market are missing German knowledge .
So far there is still no sufficient offer at general and occupational language courses .
In addition investigations show that jobs are obtained most frequently by personal contacts .
The structure of networks is therefore in opinion of Thränhardt Königsweg for work integration .
It determined the citizens of Berlin school administration that only few fled parents give their children to the day-care centers , roughly ten to 15 percent : “ For uprooted parents it is for a start completely important to hold the family together ” , says Ilja Koschembar , Sprecher for youth and family in the citizens of Berlin senate administration .
In order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the day-care center , the administration distributes handbills in different languages .
If the need of educators should rise by the large number at refugees strongly , the citizen of Berlin senate would try to increase the training capacities - about , by permitting more technical schools .
In the countries pupils without German knowledge are prepared in welcome classes for instruction .
They are informed however not always by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by instructors , who have only one qualification into German as second language .
At them no lack exists , says Beate Stoffers of the citizens of Berlin school administration .
The German student council estimates that in Germany want to study about 20 percent of the refugees .
In principle no Federal state asylum seekers forbids or waited the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Senator of the Interiors Frank Henkel ( CDU ) its attitude now however gave up .
The entrance to the university could be facilitated for study-willing refugees .
Because refugees with a residence permission or a tolerance get no more achievements after the asylum seeker achievement law , if they begin a study .
The latters get in principle no student financial assistance scheme , since they do not fall under the circle of student financial assistance scheme-entitled people .
Waited refugees must have lived so far four years in Germany , in order to be student financial assistance scheme entitled , from 1 January 2016 on shorten this span on 15 months .
Also this financing gap must be closed however , demands Steffen Krach , of Berlin Secretary of State for science , and the German student council .
The studying should get student financial assistance scheme immediately .
The Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many the religion is an important component of their identity .
The state should grant gradually the same rights as it the churches to have , and which existing state church right further to a new state religion relationship develop to the Islam .
Important would be also the establishment of an Islamic welfare organisation , which worries professionally about the newcomers .
To the rights also obligations belong .
So must agree the representatives the Islam on clear contacts and be ready to co-operate and to it certain controllability grant with the state in many ranges .
In addition also the readiness belongs to proceed courageously against religious fundamentalism .
The chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , Aiman Mazyek , expressed the concern , religious conflicts on Thursday could also to Germany be carried in .
Those , which wanted to deliver such conflicts in Germany , “ are immediately their right to stay here in Germany , incurred the loss ” , said it in the Bavarian broadcast .
It suggested translating the Basic Law on Arab .
Integration will be in the future much more still than today a topic of the whole society .
Thus also the majority society will have themselves to change , becomes the dismantling of discrimination and racism urgent .
Germany has - as result of European decisions - since a scarce decade an anti-discrimination place and a general Equality Act .
But it learns very slowly , as the NSU series of murders showed , in which police and authorities the racist motive systematically ignored .
Resemble opportunities for all : Which migrant organizations demand and the groups of interests of not-white Germans for a long time and to which international agreements like the anti-racism convention to Germany commit , reality must become in the next years , if the country to remain peaceful and its new citizens and citizen its possibilities to use be supposed - for the well-being of all .
Generally Germany is capable of supplying the refugees expected so far medically means physician president Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
“ Which concerns one power and capacities , creates we ” , said it Tagesspiegel .
However for it extra money must flow into the system .
In order to avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery demands , to hand all Ankömmlingen out equal with the registration health cards .
Furnished achievements could be accounted for later with the Federal states .
And it is most doubtful on a long-term basis to fob off so many humans with the limited service catalog which the asylum seeker achievement law plans .
Otherwise above all the language barriers make for the physicians to create .
Already so far , then the citizens of Berlin health female scientist Thea Borde proved , Migranten more badly over their diseases were cleared up than other patients .
Only in hospitals , also in medical practices interpreter costs would not have to be taken over , demand them .
Would be helped many refugees in addition , already with more general-medical refuges in the emergency outpatient clinics .
And with another diagnostic view .
Among refugee children about give it clearly more untreated handicaps , and with the young people go it around HIV clearing-up .
With the partial other symptoms German physicians from their training would cope however , mean Montgomery .
“ Parasite infestation or tuberculosis is not so difficult to recognize ” . And which concerns the lack of physician , possibly even alleviation is in view by the refugees .
The Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even physicians .
In order to be allowed , would have they however their qualification practice to prove and possibly again to examinations placings .
At least half of the refugees arriving at Germany is according to estimations of the federal psychotherapist chamber ( BPtK ) psychologically suffer : Most suffer from a post office-traumatic load disturbance or from depressions .
Particularly vulnerable is refugee children , explains Dietrich Munz , Präsident of the BPtK .
A recently published study DO Munich proven that each fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized at Germany .
Who is gotten sick with a post office-traumatic load disturbance , suffers among other things from so-called flashbacks with difficulty in breathing , fraud , tachycardia and fears of death .
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disturbances , strong unpleasantness and emotional deafness .
In order to prevent that the symptoms became chronic , it is necessary an early treatment , explained Munz .
So far received however only four percent that psychologically refugees a psychotherapy suffer .
Psychologically ill asylum-seekers in the welfare agencies can place a request for a psychotherapy , but last the treatment usually several months .
Besides specialists or physicians , who are not trained for the psychological illnesses , became mostly decide in the welfare agencies whether a therapy was necessary or not .
This leads frequently to false estimates , says Munz .

Champion League : Bavaria dream start owing to Müller and Götze
Double goal scorer in Piräus : Bavaria star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
A happy hit of Thomas Müller smoothed the way for the FC Bavaria to an earned 3:0 with Olympiakos Piräus - then lief 's .
A sovereign prelude of the championsleague season .
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave a dream start to the FC Bavaria in the madhouse of Piräus into the “ mission Milan ” .
The crew of coach Pep Guardiola won its prelude play in the champions League with the Greek record master Olympiakos in hot atmosphere owing to Müller twin pack ( 52 . /90.+2 ) and Götzes hit ( 89 . ) earns with 3:0 ( 0:0 ) .
The twelfth starting success in series is the first step direction final to 28 . May 2016 in Italy its , where Guardiola in the third approach wants to finally get the Henkelpott to Munich .
Müller received with its 28 . Hit into the champions League assistance of Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto , good-natured for Bavaria guidance , which let a shot of the world champion thought as flank happen .
“ We it to underestimate ” , had not promised Bavaria captain Philipp Lahm before the play in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 heißblütigen fans - and the Munich held word .
They showed a concentrated and engaged conception , without shining .
Piräus had won its youngest six home games in the king class , among them against considerable clubs such as Manchester United , Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin .
2011 tripped here also Borussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
But Bavaria , in seven Europacup duels with Greek teams undefeatedly , did not want to be the next victim .
They approached courageously , with their offensive efforts however often too unimaginatively to works .
The attacks were too often introduced by play shift on left wing Douglas Costa , who came through rarely against the earlier Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui .
Müller had from right more luck , than its flank from the right half field in the left upper gate-hit a corner hit .
In the 67 . Minute assigned the world champion the possible 2:0 .
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half of one .
First , when Ideye Brown the header the Poland of the line struck Olympiakos striker ( 26 . ) .
Then by direct decrease , the goalkeeper Roberto with the knee parried ( 35 . ) .
Although Bavaria drew their used to dominant play up , Piräus could set needle passes .
On goal keepers Manuel Neuer was however relying .

Croatia wants to inform itself with the neighboring country Slovenia over the facility of a passage for refugees .
“ I spoke with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior , and if it is necessary , we will organize , said a passage ” the Croatian Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and belongs already to the Schengen zone .
The EU country Croatia is still no Schengen country .
After the bulkheading of the Serbian-Hungarian border hundreds of refugees are broken open to Croatia , in order to arrive from there to Western Europe .
500 humans came over the border with Tovarnik , report the Croatian television transmitter RTL .
Hungary had blocked the day before its border for refugees .
New laws , which went in effect on the same day , make besides tidy asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redundant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explained : “ You know through journeys , and we prepare for this possibility . ”
These people are there , it are women , children and men , who want to live and reach something .
Are however humans , who did not want to live in Croatia .
The Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border of Serbia in the morning to the European Union-neighboring country Croatia .
Most came according to media reports out Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
They came both with the bus and with taxes into the Serbian border town Sid .
Immediately after their arrival they would have tried to arrive at foot over the green border to Croatia .
At the Croatian-Serbian border the refugees do not discover border fences .
But the border strip saves other dangers : There still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war lie in the 90 's .
Mine circular scrapers are to create now rapidly a safe passage .
To Hungary come meanwhile to the locking of the border hardly more refugees .
On Tuesday the police counted 366 taken up humans .
Shortly before gate conclusion on Monday still 9380 had been .
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damage of the border fence as criminal offence .
In the southHungarian border town Szeged were therefore introduced 35 criminal procedures .
The condemned one detentions threaten up to five years and the deportation from the country .
According to the immigration authority one has 94 requests for asylum received , of it nearly all - 93 - on Tuesday in the “ transit zones ” furnished again at the border altogether at the most important transition Röszke .
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children as well as two older humans .
On Wednesday morning there still 40 refugees would have be .
Practically however nobody has more a prospect to get in Hungary asylum granted .
In Hungarian opinion Serbia is a “ safe third country ” .
The rejected asylum seekers are to be pushed away there .
Before the “ transit zone ” in Röszke only few hundred refugees met .
To clear up begun in Röszke workers with it .
They collected the garbage , which tens of thousands humans had left in the past weeks at the roadside .
Check lattices were reduced and one of the admission camps in the border place was converted .
For the goal of this change nobody wanted to express itself .
The border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees reach Austria after the locking .
The country besides its border controls strengthened .

Of Brazil pediatric society Rio Grande nutrition for healthy satisfying promotes
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to clear up in shocking way women over it how importantly good nutrition is during the quiet time . She does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who suck at breasts , which are painted by unhealthy food with representations .
Mother 's milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrats , which give baby all nutrients , which need it , in order to develop a strong immune system .
Due to the additional energy requirements pregnant women and young mothers will turn out to increase their daily calorie supply by approximately 500 calories per day .

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals because of statements to wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism to TAC-sounds its player as “ agenda Setting ” from two Prime Minister League favorite of the NRL designated .
It said Sydney Roosters 's coach Trent Robinson that the arbitrators permitted “ wrestling ” to the Storm players with his team during the high Storm victory in the Qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly veiled note the Storm team , after its crew had obtained the final victory against North Queen country cowboy on Saturday evening . It called the play a “ example ” the rugby League and said that the two from Queen country were not “ too good ” in the struggle .
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of its crew and said that her with TAC-sound only on her “ contact ” were concentrated .
Bellamy added that the criticism of two confidently tunes leading coaches at his crew him , since it means that they worried , by the Storm team to be struck .
“ Always it dips - I do not have heard that Trent Robinson spoke about wrestling , as it us 24:2 struck ” , said Bellamy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we did not change generally speaking year anything in our defensive system or the techniques . But in the last six weeks we made our contact with Tackles a real emphasis , and that furnished the change of trend for us .
Trent is now for three years there , and he has to train obviously a great crew . It is probably not accustomed to it from there to lose , then it was a little a shock for it .
It is already funny , as this emerges again and again in this season .
Bellamy attacked Bennetts idea of the “ exciting football ” and reminded its mentor of the fact that Bennetts St George Illawarra of dragee ONS won the Prime Minister League in the year 2010 with “ boring ” football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
It compared its play on Saturday evening with ours on Friday evening and was as exciting their play ” , said Bellamy .
I remember that in the year 2010 St George were criticized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will worry a shitting dirt about it .
But now it has a team , which can play and which we as excitingly to view , in particular its young players with their speed .
That is the ball play , which one would like to play , if one has this kind of players .
It made this statement in the year 2010 , now wants it that all played its kind of football - not each team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like these .
I develop stronger confidence , because they say these things , because they are a little anxious to have to play against us .
Six weeks ago they did not think probably of us , when it concerned the Big Games .
Bellamy pointed out also that the play Storm obtained a higher result against Roosters than the play Broncos against cowboys .
The play of the Broncos was probably a good play , I it yet did not view , but which was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our play was 20:18 , it gave two further attempts in our play , but is that an exciting play ?
Or are breaks make and no points something tension ?
For me there is the programmes .
If they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase still it .
The Storm team has a holiday to receive North Queen country cowboy or the Cronulla Sharks on next Saturday evening in the Vorfinale in the AAMI park on this weekend , since they won the right , either . The ticket sale begins at next Tuesday mornings .

Hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with ( gilded ) the crown of thorns is one of major works , which Otmar Alt for its Bible painted .
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
At the beginning was the word ?
No , not with the Otmar alto Bible , which appeared now with magnificent pictures .
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt , who formulated its completely personal interpretations of Biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motives .
Its “ language ” with multicolored colors and fantasyful forms received to the 75-year old - which however is not by any means equivalent with “ hilarious ” pictures .
On the contrary : The respective topics adapted , that can work quite quite darkly .
Approximately three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project , for which he met an subjective-artistic selection from the many subjects area of the “ book of all books ” .
Developed cycles , which dedicate themselves to topics such as crossroad , troubles , requirements or Lord 's Prayers .
Thus it fascinated spontaneously directly several partners : That is valid for the Luther publishing house with its theological adjustment just like for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
And there above all the author is Klaus Altepost , who argued on basis of the painting with the respective Bible places .
It interpreted and in such a way into today , into current connections “ translated ” the Bible places selected by Otmar Alt .
These texts are like verbal mirrors of alto painting .
Embedded they are between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and in each case a set of the artist , who formulates its completely personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
The jewelry cover has golden type characters .
Thus the 75-year old permits equivalent doubly a deep insight of its soul , its emotions .
That is a high degree at intimacy .
Emotions were in the long run at all triggers for the Bible project : Otmar Alt , 1940 in Wernigerode born and in Berlin grown up , comes from a family , which belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter medal .
“ There the education happened already with cane ” , remembers Otmar Alt .
“ I tried to regenerate around me perhaps also again with the Mr. Vater to stand ” .
Its second request is to help the art in fast moving time again to more value : “ The perception of picture worlds is today coined of advertisement , and those is loud .
Symbolism is displaced there .
Artists have another desire and Wonne to show things .
Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
“ In this regard I am a dinosaur ” .
Otmar Alt would like to let it affect that the viewers “ fall themselves ” into the pictures leave , itself , discovers and to feel , which strength her to have : “ The picture looks for itself its opposite ” .
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday with the presentation of the Otmar alto Bible in the Otmar alto foundation , “ always ” a lover of Otmar Alts 's art to have been : “ I like , like he with its pictures lives understand ” .
Old not paid attention to seize the Bible completely but selected , the also mysterious topics important for it .
“ That was not co-operation on eye level ” , says old person post office : “ Here it concerns the pictures , the text described only ” . Developed a picture Bible .
For Hans Möhler of the Luther publishing house this work is an invitation to deepen “ its life and find freedom ” .
Otmar Alts 's pictures ( Biblical ) the language of the love and those speak the responsibility for Möhler both .
A part that originals - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition , which is opened on 15 November in the Otmar alto foundation .

Eight golden rules for the life in student hostels
Before eleven years pulled I as oblivious of all around one 19-year olds into a student hostel , still in the faith in Berets and moral relativism , but I remember only now the strained smile of those , which I annoyed - and to the numerous , long-winded complaints at others .
Most that I learned , can be distilled in eight simple rules .
The introduction into student hostels is enough from easily nerve-racking to absolutely alarmingly .
It is enticing to be chatted : Humans tell , from where you come whether and where you took Sabbath year , where you hate you regarding Corbyn stand and why “ honestly said Marmite neither dear nor , because in Ernst , boy , it is only one yeast excerpt HAHAHA , I am in my room . ”
Atmen Sie through .
And you help others to do same - places you questions and show you interest .
It directs the discussion and helps you to find humans out you likes contrary to those , with which you would not speak , even if your lashes started to burn and were these fire extinguishers .
Leave to humans .
The rooms of humans often transform into beverage receptions , film night of places of event and local meeting places , but they are also the places , in which humans dress and adjust their underwear .
Referred on that : Do not remember to begin at the university with a relationship
Introverted ones receive a rough treatment at the university .
Their room should be a refuge , but many student hostels form a space space strolling culture , which is friendly and social action and can to lifelong friendship lead .
That can be hell for someone , which tries , to recover .
Nothing in the culture permits to tell you : “ I like you , and I want that our friendship continues , but you must leave , so that I receive the energy back , which I used for the interaction with you . ”
Try to feel , when a fellow student of sociability exhausts actual and sends you him a SMS instead of to knock .
Apropos knock : Do it .
A chap in my student hostels had the conception that a not locked door was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Friendship close by cheeks .
Since you begin the university on the high point of the baking mania , is knocking at the doors of humans , in order to introduce itself with a plate of full Brownies , less strangely than the greetings of the 1950-er years “ welcomes in the neighbourhood , I you somewhat baked . So , and please smile now , if I place a few personal questions to you . ”
House-made treats to offer is a good way , in order to close friendships .
Their co-inhabitants feel obligated to converse and in the end perhaps your face with a delicious surprise will associate .
Naturally this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
Badly mixed lumps from flour , sugar and fat lead to the fact that people place themselves sleeping , if you knock .
Food to steal , is a usual crime in student hostels .
Is stealing of chicken a theft natural , but is it taking drops a Milchs for your tea also ?
Examine with the milk owner .
The opportunities stand well that they say , to avail itself even if they cook on the inside .
If someone steals your things , that is annoying , and you have my sympathy - however you try to punish with it more balanced to deal than my co-inhabitant , who added their milk a detergent , in order thieves .
It now is in the prison .
They should not make noise , which holds people from the sleep or from the work .
It does not only go being therefore , decent humans , but that you belong in the truest sense of the proverb to humans , which sit in the glasshouse .
A girl on my corridor asked its neighbours , whether it constitutes them somewhat to place therefore & bass somewhat more quietly because it three o'clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
They reacted to it with still louder music .
When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock , them let their neighbours sleep kindly to still two hours , before she let her own music blare , their door locked and to their three-hour examination went .
Would n't it be romantic , if your future marriage partner would draw coincidentally into the same student hostel ?
It would not have turned around , if you regard a co-inhabitant as your future marriage partner , to it makes a pass abysmally embarrassing , again separates and it each day to then see must and perhaps see , how it draws all common friends over to itself ?
Naturally the heart its own ways - however if a hot co-inhabitant is definitely not your future marriage partner , goes tries you at least to talk your abdomen little reason .
In the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone its keys in its not locked room has leaves , are the border between a joke and a bullying more finely , than it seems .
A good caper is hilariously , but it takes only instants , until it becomes the boomerang .
Give through to hiding places a valuable and amusing lesson over security - however you never spoil someone rooms with tooth paste and shampoo .
Lock their door , and you put their keys into a glass of water , which you do not determine then into the freezer - however TAC core you their possessions at the cover any more than twice .

Of Europe refugee crisis : Hungary explains state of emergency , closes the border , holds back refugees
Hungary explains the state of emergency and blocked the southern borders with Serbia on Tuesday and held all , which tried , to come illegaly into the country . Everything with the goal of stopping the inflow from Migranten to .
Chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of Migranten collected in a no man 's land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation .
Humans , who had fled before force , were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip at the road between the two inspection points of the countries and built tents and established themselves there .
But frustrations rose .
When a law enforcement helicopter over them floated , the Migranten chanted “ opens the border ! ” and offenses cried against the Hungarian auxiliary police .
Some rejected from protest food and water .
Of Serbia ministers of foreign affairs explained , it was “ unacceptable ” that Migranten from Hungary were sent back , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) part of the solution and not a collateral damage want to be .
Discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place ” , said Ivica Dacic in Prague in the coming days .
The turbulences at the Hungarian-Serbian border did not come after the day the 28-Nationen-Block with a contentious meeting into Brussels a common immigration policy to agree could .
The Ministers agreed however to divide the responsibility for 40.000 humans who looked for refuge in surprised Italy and Greece . They expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement was obtained that the European Union member states would accept further 120,000 refugees , among them also some from Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European union on Tuesday , in order to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary did not set however its hopes on an imminent action of Brussels or of its neighbours .
On Tuesday the proclaimed state of emergency in two southern regions gave more powers to authorities for the management of the crisis , so that they could close roads off and to accelerate asylum proceedings .
The Hungarian minister of foreign affairs Peter Szijjarto said meanwhile that its country also the building of a barbed wire fence along his border to Romania flat , in order the inflow of Migranten by the country to stop - after it terminated a fence at the Serbian border .
Of CBS news correspondent Charlie D'Agata it reported that even prison passengers were used with the race to provide the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
In the last months Hungary for many war refugees became from Syria and in the Near East elsewhere a substantial bottleneck and the point of entrance into the European union .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted however on the fact that most arriving economic refugees are , who are in the search for a better life , and not war refugees , who have requirement on protection - an opinion , which stands for Germany strongly in the contradiction to other European Union member states , under it .
The new laws , which went in effect around midnight in Hungary , make a crossing of the border or a damaging the 4-meter ( 13 foot ) of the high fence , the government let which build along the southern border to Serbia , a crime . These laws specify also higher detentions for condemned human being resellers .
“ Due to the situation , which resulted from the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency condition ” , said to government spokesmen Zoltan Kovacs 's reporters in the southern city Szeged .
We say it very clearly : Illegal border crossing is a crime .
The parliament must still agree process engineering still the employment of the military , which is expected for next week , but reporter of Associated Press to have at the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days seen .
Gyorgy Bakondi , Landes-Sicherheitsberater for Orban , said that authorities were 45 humans with the attempt , who got to cross border 15 others already more deeply penetrated into the country .
They come over , by damaging the fence , it are now in police custodies and committing of criminal offences after the new laws are accused of .
Authorities are about to repair the fence fast .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning also , after a course railroad car with barbed wire had arrived , in order to close the borders .
Chaos surrounded the most important border transition close Roszke to work on Hungary , when those opened Hungary a small office in a metal container , in order the data from humans to and a crowd pressed , in order to interlope itself there .
About 20 it succeeded to come , but thousands remained outside .
A further group of Migranten blocked the most important motorway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water , until they may enter to Hungary .

That will happen , if the Fed increases the interest
An increase in interest comes , and the boom will come into staggering , net yields for loans will become will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession .
We know .
Which we do not know are , how last long that everything and how long will stop it .
In particular history offers only small instruction for the economy for execution .
A recession came within only 11 months to the first interest rate increase and took 86 months .
The aggressiveness of Federal Reserve with the raising of the interest rates often is , if also not always , a factor thereby how the economy and the financial assets react .
Therefore representatives of the US-central bank stressed so violently that investors should not concentrate on when them begin to increase the interest rates but rather on the period , which is needed for the normalization .
Indeed several variables play a role .
In the end market players could state however that the whole excitement was possibly exaggerated because of an increase in interest .
“ The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted inevitably of some as a signal for the end the era “ of the cheap money ” ” , said Julian Jessop , Chefökonom with Capital Economics , in a report at customers .
In contrast to it we expect not the gradual return of the US-interest to normal heights , but still on too low level , in order to the seismic shock , which many seem to be afraid to lead .
That means however not that it will not give effects .
Here is a view of , based on historical trends how some ranges of the economy could react :
How the market saw in the last month , the anticipation of increases in interest can make things for one while volatile .
As soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
“ There is apparently a tendency that receipts from capital 12 to 24 months after the first increase are strangled , which reflects , said perhaps again the delay in the monetary policy ” German bank analysts in a newer study to what happens after increases in interest of the Fed .
More exactly said , the market is in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2,6 percent ) , then back to the normal condition after 500 days , with an average net yield in the past six cycles of 14,4 percent , passed , according to a current analysis , which Bob Doll , boss investment strategist with Nuveen ate management , with Barron 's published .
It said Deutsche Bank that the effects arise tendentious later on the shares in the increase cycle and the net yield begins to be reduced .
Recessions are a fact of the economic life , but increases in interest often promote them .
In the current case the Fed is confronted with some conditions , which there were not before and which could to accelerate a recession .
Extremely remarkably it is here that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point during an increase in interest of the Fed .
According to Deutsche Bank only twice the nominal Gross Domestic Product was below 4,5 percent with the 118 increases in interest since 1950 .
Although the second quarter was 2015 with 3,6 percent , only few expect that this will persist and to expect for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 percent .
Increases in interest with a so fragile economical backdrop could be risky and throw the question up , “ whether it this time different are ” , said Deutsche Bank .
Market players made themselves calm all year on an increase in interest of the Fed , and all eyes were this week directed toward the meeting of the federal open Market Committee , which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economist believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting , the Futures trade indicates only a probability of 25 percent .
“ In our study all increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a supercycle with increasing momentum at the Gross Domestic Product and prerecession heights very fast after the beginning of the recovery outshone ” , so the report .
In contrast to it this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession was in the observed phase .
The current cycle is by far the longest , which the Fed waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
The firm income was also volatile , since the market anticipates an increase in interest , and the sample is rather similar as on the capital market .
The main difference is the fact that the effect is faster with loans than with shares if changes its strategic course .
With loans the net yields seem to change the direction , as soon as the first increase/lowering takes place in the cycle .
In the end the increase cycle the loan net yields fall immediately , said Deutsche Bank .
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise will lead with the interest rates to the fact that net yields between longer and shorter loans move closer together closer and lead to a flattening of the curve .
High-interest-bearing loans bring often in such a climate better yields , although “ we are still careful , higher yields to expect ” , said Kathy Jones , Fixed Income Analyst with Schwab , in an analysis .
, Means Jones is interesting that the markets already adapted to Fed strategy expectations .
“ Apart from the strength of the dollar and the decrease of inflation expectations there are some signs for the fact that the market to the prospect on stricter monetary policy adapted ” wrote her .
Short term interest rose , the yield curve is flatter , credit breakdowns expanded and volatility rose - all characteristics of the market , if the Fed intensifies its strategy .
On the whole enterprises , which complete the larger part of their business activity in the USA , will profit from it , if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
Multinational enterprises with high debts will more badly stand there , there a rising dollar their products on the global market make more expensive and likewise the financing of their debts .
“ History shows that “ quality “ shares bends to extremely positively react three months after a initial increase in interest ” said Goldman Sachs-Analysten in a report for the customers .
Companies with strong balance exceeded enterprises with weak balance on the average after each of the increases in interest 1994 , 1999 and 2004 around 5 percentage points .
Enterprises with high capital net yields as well as low volatility with its shares exceeded also her counterparts with bottom quality around on the average in each case 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debts become a large problem .
Enterprises with a high portion of flexible interest will lose at most , said Goldman .
Outside of the pure share plays consumer will likewise profit by the rising dollar .
Savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are , how quickly that will take place .

Time of the decision over interest rates for the Federal Reserve Bank
Die Welt observes , if the Federal Reserve Bank meets on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time for nearly one decade the interest is raised or not .
Survey under 80 economists , who were asked by Reuters , found out that a little more than half , which still last week of the opinion was that the Fed will do this , now thinks that the Fed some more will longer remain and on the current conditions of 0 0.25 percent will hold the interest rates .
It is a historical event , because it seven years ago is , since the Fed set interest to ZERO .
“ For the first time we approach to a situation , in which a large central bank possibly leaves the zero-range and ” Angel Ubide , leading employee at Peterson Institute starts , said a process of the normalization of the interest rates for internationally Economics .
The U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , trillions dollar to the balance is added and generates only a small inflation .
However the Fed can not ignore the less rosy view on global conditions .
It warned the markets to adjust itself to an increase but it points the signs to the fact that the opportunities are good against such a step .
The decision is to be announced at 20.00 o'clock MEZ on Thursday

Project heaves : Details lie on the table
Planning to the cottage settlement at the small sea with Emden accepts shape .
The investor presented for the first time publicly plans for the project .
Some adjoining owners are further concerned - they fear the sellout of their leisure refuge

But it is good to be able to meet all rumors now .
That approximately ten to twelve million euros expensive projects stands for months in the discussion .
Violent reactions among owners of sea barrack , who had come into the meeting , caused the pictures and new details to the desired building of hotels .
Roberto Schulz , Meerbudenbesitzer and Vorstandsmitglied during the protection of interests of the adjoining owners , pro heave , complain : “ That is towered above a giant block , the all other Gebaude ” .
Besides he is afraid like some other project critics that traffic would increase by the intended size of the plant strongly : “ There whole bus loads must come , thus count themselves ” , thus Schulz
Which happens exactly on that well a hectare large area of the former restaurant , is however still open .
Still there is no operator .
“ Only we must have a conclusive concept be present ” , said to it Ralf Behrends .
Because this was still missing , also the development plans were still variable .

Ben Carson moves up with country-wide survey close behind Donald Trump
Ben Carson is with the newest survey of CBS news/New York Times closely behind Donald Trump
To the two candidates in the meantime half of the support of the voters in the new survey is allotted , and others lose dramatically at stop
Republican voters support country-wide further Trump in large number . The support grows from 23 % in the last CBS survey , which was accomplished before of Fox News debate in the past month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
But Carson shot in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
The survey showed also that Carson arrives at demographic groups well and exceeds Trump among republican voters with university formation .
The rest of the field , with exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio governor John Kasich , is reduced with of Wisconsin governor Scott Walker , who is most deeply fallen , from 10 % support in the last month on now 2 % .
The former Florida governor Jeb Bush , the former governor of Arkansas 's Mike Huckabee and Florida-Senator Marco Rubio are with 6 % at the third place .

For easily overweight diabetics decrease in weight surgery can be helpful .
The advantages of the decrease in weight surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years according to a new study .
It is still too early , in order to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live after the decrease in weight surgery longer than those , which receive non-surgical treatments .
“ The number of deaths data need a long time , in order to show something , ” said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert of the decrease in weight surgery , to which a editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery wrote .
Decrease in weight operations or adiposity surgery , use different methods , in order to make the size smaller of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body 's own ability to take up food .
Over the years adiposity operations proved for the treatment of Typ-2-Diabetes as efficient , but most studies were accomplished with humans , who are higher diseased obese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or .
BMI , a certain measure in weight regarding size , is considered as normally between 18,5 and 24,9 .
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and humans with a BMI over 30 are considered as obese .
They can compute your BMI here : 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv .
For the new study the researchers from of Taiwan used min Sheng General hospital data , them since 2007 in a study collected and to compare thereby two kinds of adiposity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach hose formation - for medical treatments for Typ-2-Diabetes with humans , who were easily overweight .
The average BMI under those , which underwent of this operation , was reduced from 31 to 24,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
Meanwhile the BMI remained with those , the non-surgical diabetes treatments received approximately directly with 29 .
Under those , which underwent to a surgical interference , the diabetes illness separated completely and with 28 % partly with 36 % .
In the medical-treated group partly separated in the comparison to it the diabetes completely only with a percent and with only about two percent .
Beyond that the results were generally better with controls of the blood pressure , the Triglyceride and “ bad ” LDL cholesterol “ in the 'surgical ' group ” , found the authors out .
The researchers supervised also the patient blood level of hemoglobin A1c , which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of the time .
Hemoglobin A1c is held best under 7 percent , writes the researchers .
After the operation average hemoglobin A1c level of approximately 9 percent sank on approximately 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group it remained however stable with approximately 8 percent .
But this better “ glykämische control ” - how in improved hemoglobin A1c level reflects itself you - the number of deaths did not reduce Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and its colleagues in five years , so the leading researcher .
The research team compared also average results with the two kinds of the surgery .
In the fifth year the bypass surgery group had lost reached larger decreases in the BMI ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) compared with the gastrectomy group more weight ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , and registered rather a complete overcoming the diabetes ( 46.9 % vs. 16.7 % ) .
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of the surgery after five years , it gives references from a study of heavier humans in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Blackstone of the University OF Arizona , college OF Medicine Phoenix .
In the Swedish study it was with obese humans , who underwent of a adiposity operation , about 29 percent in the course of 15 years to less probably die - compared with a group , which tried more conventional methods .
Although the new study did not show an advantage for surviving with the surgery patients , Blackstone , said was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 , which is interested in the procedure .
“ That is the critical point of this study , because she says the fact that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group ” , without increased risk of death or , said it to a kidney disease .
Blackstone added that humans and their physicians should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient with its BMI lies between 27 and 30 .
“ I think that we wait too long , until we bring humans to it this seriously to take ” , told them .
I think that as soon as they accumulated these genetic changes , which connected their bodies firmly with obesity and diabetes , are a reversal really heavily . ”

Seven 's Sunrise dominates the evaluations to take over despite the attempts of Nine , the loss of the leadership with the Today show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush after Canberra , in order to report following the loss of the leadership of the liberals , but it furnished no large shifts with the evaluations for Today .
The breakfast show of Nine was radiated by the Federal Capital , when Malcolm Turnbull created the fall of Tony Abbott .

Adam Lyth was clearly threatened from the exclusion from of England crew , but it is still heavy
Pakistan in the united Arab emirates to discover , is a difficult task , but if one sees the cadre , which England for the tour selected , a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat does not stand on my map .
I would not exclude an away victory .
Alastair Cooks 's side is possibly less experienced than before three years , but there are good spin players in the Batting list , and the team spirit is strong ; they will not carry scars of 2012 , only a juvenile-positive attitude .
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as spin Bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
On that referred message : Adam Lyth is ruled out from the England test cadre and by Alex Hales is replaced .
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is natural for me as its coach in Yorkshire to analyze with difficulty .
With its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple , but harsh reality is that cricketers are aligned to results .
There were no question marks with Joe 's roots , for example , and player led its own best choice devices is to the nomination , there - and I had a while ago said this - .
Long ago one would have extended the run of Lyth , but he had control of his own fate .
If it drives hopefully further runs out for Yorkshire , a further opportunity comes .
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even if he did not furnish so good achievements , and does not surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
The question , how much time a test Schlagmann receives , in order to set its indication , is difficult .
Lyth got seven opportunities - like SAM Robson before it - , while Nick Compton got nine .
Only Compton got the opportunity to home and away games .
The only reproach , which one can raise , was that England used first Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - however this lost opportunity lies now in the past .
Alex Hales comes in , and it is a Schlagmann , which I estimate highly .
It is a X-factor-Cricketspieler , which we saw with Yorkshire early in this season , when he obtained 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place , what us much met .
It must at least receiving the same opportunities as before him , but this depends naturally on the team selection in the united Arab emirates .
The idea to let Moeen beside Cook strike which would receive a extra spin Bowler to furnish and four Quicks , emerged , and I did not have anything against it .
I do not see , why a Schlagmann can not strike there , and this left-handed person already showed that it is a hotshot of Cricket player .
Moeen did not settle but is perhaps its job for its County Worcestershire , it a number 3 for it , and there there is no big difference .
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests with the first drop , before he appeared to 2001 as Opener .
It created and did not look back three hundred of run immediately not .
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a BACK-UP crank , and in my limited handling him he impressed me as a young man very much .
People see themselves possibly its statistics on on the average to 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and to think , it is a Punt , but there is no large number of backup cranks , who raise their hands and coaches have themselves for youth decided which .
He will learn on this tour a quantity .
Apart from the crew England made a few intelligent additions at the training staff .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the batsman from Sri Lanka , as advisors for the test matches could be a master coup .
It is one the nice Estonian of chaps of the play , which will bring along an abundance of experiences , since it played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase the tour and brings energy and a strong employment in the setup .
I felt always already that he is creative for the international Cricket competition , when players or as a coach , and how Mahela has he insights , from which we can profit .
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing room , even if the news stands in conformity with before the saying .
Collys team colleague with Durham , Ben Stokes , is not used with the One Dayers , to roots did not receive a similar break against Australia and I for my part has no problem thereby .
Some will not agree , but Coaches and team stand-up displays do not determine the schedule .
And you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
Such decisions are not made light heart .

Drawbacks in the attitude of circus animals are only too often topic with different animal rights groups .
Stephanie Probst takes also in addition position : “ Are our animals not well , do not go it also to us not well ” .
Approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each Streicheleinheit .
The “ four-legged kindists ” , how they are affectionately called , after possibility each desire is read off from the eyes .
We want to co-operate with the animals and with them let us joke have .

Surely does David Cameron The Lorax know better ?
It is a thing , which all parents learn soon : If your child loves a book , it will not for a long time last , until you know it nearly by heart .
It is , you is perhaps David Cameron .
When it was asked of a provider of child care systems to call its favourite children 's book the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax , the 1971 published environmental fable of Dr. Seuss .
It was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps , and continues : “ hilariously , moving , creatively and with a strong message to always give it is a book , which I read out gladly to my children , because it seems a picture or a message which we missed so far . ”
Everything beautifully and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron describes allegedly the action of the book , instead a summary of the film version of 2012 shows , which new characters and details added , to extend in order the rather short original text .
“ In the midst of the ummauerten city Thneed Ville , where all nature went and even air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey to win the girl of its dreams by its desire to see a genuine tree fulfilled ” , reading one . An interest of love was to Dr. Seuss , whose correct name Theodor Seuss hostage read and to who 1991 died , however completely unknown .
As if that would be suspicious not yet enough : The text submitted by Cameron reads itself partly like the summary that of the Lorax film , which is presented on the website by Internet Movie DATA base and begins in such a way : “ In the ummauerten city Thneed Ville , where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey to win the girl of its dreams . ”
Although it admits yes , a pragmatic father to be , it seems improbable that Cameron the action of the book is so little familiar . Here a unnamed boy , how the local environment by the money-hungry , trees fällenden , hears Thneed knitting Once more ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax , a squatting , schnurrbärtigen nature , “ in the name of the trees speaks ” , is devastated .
In all probability such was delegated a relatively low PR-task to an aide , that did not read out The Lorax 20 times one behind the other a child .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text had probably come from Cameron 's constituency office .
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron 's employees , gave however no further direct comments .

BBC should give EastEnders up , says former boss of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said , which should stop BBC to send programs such as EastEnders and The Voice . He said that commercial rival would give “ their right arm ” for hit shows like Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only in order to make the kind from programs to , which are not sent by other UK-transmitters .
He criticized the BBC for the fact that her public programs , which are probably seen by a smaller audience to place into hard disputed time windows against popular shows of their rivals and from transmitters such as BBC4 .
After the BBC general manager , Tony Hall , said , who wanted to do enterprise more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that it had tried six years long in its time with Channel 4 without success to come with the BBC into contact .
“ I have problems with the idea that BBC gives or sends programs in order , which were shown also clearly by not subsidized rivals ” , said Johnson the upper house communication committee in the framework of its investigation about the future of the BBC .
If you liked to hold the broadcast fee , what I central or on a long-term basis for a good idea to hold , one should not its production at least on programs , which do not make or in order give others .
They send The Voice in a first-class time window , because they want to achieve as broad a support for their future as possible .
The idea that otherwise nobody would show this , is a joke , it is ridiculous , it is naturally nonsense .
Johnson said : “ I do not see , why a regressive tax finances programs , which could be financed also without subsidies .
The Voice is such a program , EastEnders is a further , admittedly both own productions .
Honestly other channels were said their to right arm for it to give .
I strive to see , how this public television is to be .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC debt at the hunt for evaluations was “ because of the ambitions of humans , who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way , around long-term support to secure . ”
Its comments on popular transmissions the BBC show that , which the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in its MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh suggested in the year 2003 that the BBC should sell shows such as EastEnders .
Johnson said that the rather public niche programs should go “ to BBC4 , where one can not measure rather the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can not argue , if they go to radio licence fees on their hypocritical missions to the justification from 4 billion £ , “ now , naturally , we have all these obscure programs provided , the anybody saw . ”
They put it into a time window , in which nobody wanted to ever see them .
To the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee : “ I request you to find a rather regressive system regarding conditions who can obtain the best value from this .
Naturally you think all , think we everything the fact that one obtains a large value for 150 £ per year here , but for people , which is for the 150 £ a quantity money , ask me whether is correct , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
The former Sky and Channel 5-boss of David Elstein , who stated also before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC was to examine their Reithian mission to inform “ to form and maintain ” .
He said , only little of BBC production officially as education was classified now - he said that 1 % of its TV-production and 0.1 % were in the radio - and them should take themselves in the public television stations in Australia and Canada an example this to change in “ inform , clear up and maintain ” .
To the question of the partnerships said Elstein , the BBC should do more within ranges like those of the PROMs , of which he that only one handful said it is on TV shown and with which commercial transmitters alliances are received , in order all online to make available .

Jarryd Hayne had several options , in order to begin its NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed large interest after its move into the USA - and there were many other teams , which sent end of last year requests after its impressing open training day .
But Hayne selected the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like an intelligent decision .
Some coaches would have banished Hayne for the rest of the play on the bank , when it lost a wrangling in such a way , as it did the Aussie rugby league convert with its first Punt Return on Tuesday with 20-3 the victory against Minnesota .
But Tomsula trusted its man and gave to Hayne the next opportunity to a Punt Return and also to the current play after an injury of Reggie Bush .
Tomsula showed further its true face in the changing room after the play .
Instead of grinding its Rookies before the rest of the team by the mill , it encouraged it .
Tomsula strengthened Hayne also publicly in its press conference after the play .
The 49er it sport reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was encouraged also by special team co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey , who guessed/advised him to forget its to messed up catch and worry about the next play .
Jarryd Hayne blunders with a Punt , which was restored in the first play quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It was not surely the start , which Hayne and its substantial Australian followers for its NFL debut had expected .
Hayne left the playing field after the Fumble swearing and told later the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104,1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his NFL career ,
“ That was a thing , which occurs just , one worries only about the next play , and that is it , ” said Hayne .
Hayne compared the gaffe at that time with its Origin debut in the year 2007 , when a passport led with in its own in-Goal range to a Try for Queen country .

The opening of the parliament was clouded also by statements by delegates of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and them were warned to accompany the speech of Mr Mugabe with boos .
In the past month they had booed it and it during its speech for the situation of the nation in the parliament had interrupted - this is the speech , which he repeated on Tuesday .
The spokesman of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for demo CRA TIC CHANGE - MDC ) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians SMS news on their mobile phones received , which warned them of it Mr. To disturb Mugabes 's speech .
“ The message comes from a number , which is not shown , but she has the title 'death ' ” , said he journalists after Mugabes speech .

'Sonogenetics ' can steer brain cells by sound waves
The video shows , how the Nematoden changes the direction in the moment , in which it with sound impulses is illuminated .
Scientists bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be steered by outbreaks of sound waves .
The tiny Nematoden changes the direction in the instant in that it with sound impulses , which have for the human hearing to high frequencies , in order to be heard to be illuminated .
The impulses work by switching on on of motor neuron cells , which are genetically changed , in order to carry the diaphragm channels , which react to ultrasonic waves .
Further to this topic : Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said , who showed worms the power of a new procedure , called Sonogenetics , with the ultrasonic be used can , in order a set of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body to activate .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researcher at the Salk of institutes in La Jolla , California , said an invasive procedure , which delivers electrical impulses into the brain from humans to the treatment of the symptoms of the parkinson 's disease to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth brain stimulation .
Thread worms do not react usually to ultrasonic , but Chalasani stated that they did it , if they were surrounded with microscopic bubbles by a liquid .
, He found , strengthens the blisters out the ultrasonic waves , which penetrate then into the worms .
The intensified ultrasonic waves affect structures , which are called TRP-4-Ionenkanäle and in the diaphragms of some the worm cells are found .
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells , they are assigned to which , such a report Nature Communications .
In order to create ultrasonic-steered Nematoden , Chalasani changed genetically the worms in such a way that some its TRP-4-Ionenkanäle carried for motor neurons .
If it applies ultrasonic to the changed creatures , the sound waves are strengthened by the micro vesicles and transferred into the worms , where they switch on for changed motor neurons .
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics , innovative tools , which make scientists possible , neurons with impulses of the light switch on and off .
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages in relation to this technology .
Contrary to light , which must be down-sent to optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultrasonic waves fabrics can unhindered happen and know into the brain from above on the head to be sent in such a way .
“ We believe to make that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible , targeted the human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical attitude to certain neurological treatments ” , said Chalasani .
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells , added it .

Space probe “ Cassini ” finds ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the ice tank of the Saturn moon Enceladus a global ocean sloshes .
Researchers conclude from observations of the space probe “ Cassini ” .
Therefore the moon tumbles easily on its course around the ring planet .
This dutch roll is only small , but nevertheless too large for a continuous firm heavenly body , it means in a report of the Cornell university in Ithaca ( U.S. state New York ) of Tuesday .
The researchers present their analyses in the trade paper “ Icarus ” .
Already longer it was well-known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus .
Thus “ Cassini ” had discovered already 2006 ice volcanos at the South Pole of the Saturn moon , the water vapour and ice particle to spit and thus the so-called E-ring the Saturns to feed .
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , closed the astronomers at that time .

Which we need now , are intervening the British government and the warranty that torture devices are not illegaly acted before our doorstep .
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapon fair originates approximately from the range within Excel , where exhibitors of fantastic euphemistic products sell .

The absence of similar representations in shows is obviously , particularly with this in view , as the need for men to open than ever before became now still more desperate , as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high prove .
In the year 2013 it was the most important cause of death with men in the age from 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more frequently with men than with women .
In the effort to concern the problem the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM - campaign against a miserable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , to question with whom a goal , the culture , which prevents men to look for assistance if they need these .
Friendship is the heart in the fight , in order to master this challenge .
A current study with more than 2,000 High School pupils with depressive symptoms stated that , if the suffering had a sufficient high percentage at friends with “ healthy tendency ” its opportunities doubled themselves on recovery .
For those , which are not depressive , a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems .
But naturally one must have for a start friends , so that a friendship can function .
In the age across social media directed of communication , with their emphasis on style across substance the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
Our digital lives have the necessity , strongly , to appear gaily and successfully doubled , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
This superficial success is dominated of , which psychologists extrinsische values call ; Money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsischer values - our internal longing after personal development and friendship , which affect our mental health many more deeply .
And like a video game inventor and a billionaire recently explained , money can not buy luck really .
The beautiful with Friends was that this focusing was placed on the head .
Each character did not become by its work , but defines by its personality , that shone by the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent embraces , moments when football looking in cosy armchairs and the longing from steed to Rachel - all it came from the knowledge that men can refer to in any case even if they often hold back themselves to explore completely their feelings .
As an employee of the crisis hotline it me explained : … “ my listener role for humans , who are depressive to feel and potentially suicidal , really clearly showed me , as even the smallest interactions of friends a difference to make can . ”
The men , who contact us , often do not feel in the situation to speak with friends .
The old idiom “ I come thereby by right ” has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is noticed as weakness , if one speaks about problems openly . ”
Friends is one of the shows , which me strikes , if I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms .
It presents completely clearly the small moments of man friendships .
So much my objective outsider status over the telephone humans in instants of the despair to also help likes , the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so , if you arranged on this weekend Comedy cent ral FriendsFest with backdrop in honor of the day completely new visit , why you do not carry then your friends forward to a drink in the cent ral Perk .
Or , still better , if you see sitting around into of Starbucks someone alone , give him a smile and say you to hello .
One never knows , your friendship which difference could make .

Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg with the championsleague defeat of Manchester with the PSV Eindhoven .
While this brought the left counsel for the defense to crying and will exclude it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Gaal hope does not give up that Shaw can play again in this season .
The injury became by an inconsiderate attack of Héctor Moreno in the 15 . Minute causes , after the 20 years old Shaw had broken in into the PSV range .
It was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen , before he was brought in the hospital .
Van Gaal said : “ It has a double leg fracture and lies in the hospital . ”
It is moved tomorrow or perhaps one day later and operated then in Manchester .
It is terrible - a boy , who comes with 18 to Manchester United , plays it very heavily has and then fantastically , and then happens that .
In the changing room it wore an oxygen mask .
It cried .
I am not a physician , but if you have a double fracture , then that takes six months , and he will not play in the group stage .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy , escaped from a red card and the imposition of a penalty kick to be .
Nicola Rizzoli , who arbitrators , has the Mexican not punished .
Van Gaal assumed that the Italian arbitrator had erred .
They can judge for itself , if I say that a penalty kick and a red card were due .
It was a very bad attack with both legs .
A Tweet on Shaws account read : “ I thank you all for your news . Words can not describe , how broken I am , my way to the recovery begin now , I return more strongly again . ”
Referred on that : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw with the defeat with the PSV
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European championship in France for recovering by coming June .
Phillip Cocu , who said PSV coaches : “ It is a very bad injury . ”
If a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad over it .
It is never the intention of our players of injuring an opponent .
Moreno suffered a leg break , when Mexico played Van Gaals against Holland crew at the WM 2014 .
“ He does very heavily , because it was not its intention to injure the opponent and if you hear then that it is a very bad injury , are not good that ” , said Cocu .
For me it was not possible to see the instant .
The only one , which I could see , was the ball , which was into another direction on the way , so that it looked , as if it [ Moreno ] had affected it , but I could not see the attack on hatch .
In the discussion with SBS6 Moreno said : “ I white , as it feels , I know , how heavy something like that can be .
I feel very badly thereby . It does suffering in such a way to me .
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was brought also in the hospital - after a foul play of Chris Smalling .

8 poll ratings , which show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously .
Some tried to brand it as flop .
Others shrugged off it than a joke .
And some wait for a collapse .
But no matter , as some republicans try , to Donald Trump of upper ranks with surveys to pull downward , it ( still ) did not function .
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in the two digit range lead , and some began to ask oneself seriously what for the opportunities of the nomination of the real estate Moguls means it .
Naturally it is still too early in the electoral period .
None states that Trump will probably win the republican nomination .
Experts stress that at this time in the year 2011 Rick Perrys 's guidance was transferred to ascending Herman Cain , from whom no only a state during the nomination process won .
And there are many reasons , why he would have to fight in a general choice .
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush 's super PAC and the conservative branch of economic activity club for Growth recognize now Trumps staying power and begin to let their dollar flow in order to fall it .
Here are some current poll ratings , which point to the fact that the real estate Mogul is not only a temporary phase :
Trumps of popularity values 180 degrees .
Briefly before Donald Trump announced its candidacy in the middle of June , a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two of ten republicans positively saw the real estate Mogul .
To in the middle of July there was 40 percent .
At the beginning of August were there 52 percent .
Now six of 10 republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump .
About three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
And these numbers hold themselves in early states .
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa stated last week that 60 percent of the republicans have a good opinion of Trump .
Two thirds of the GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates .
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week said 67 percent of the republicans , they would be enthusiastically ” or “ content ” either “ , if Trump were nominated .
Only two of 10 say , they would be “ annoyed ” , if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Carson creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say , they would be “ enthusiastically ” vs. 40 percent , which said the same about Trump ) .
The next in things enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
On the other side it says 47 percent of the republican voters that they would be dissatisfied ” or “ annoyed ” “ , if Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , became the candidate .
A majority of the republicans does not see Trumps temperament as problem .
While Donald Trump is criticized far away for his bombastic and insulting statements , thus ABC News/Washington Post believe 52 percent the Irish voter that the real estate Mogul has the correct temperament for a president , tending to the republicans , on Monday .
The same number is valid for the Federal State Iowa in the first preselection state of the nation , where the same 52 percent of the republicans it thinks that he has the personality for a commander in chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
Nevertheless it thinks 44 percent that he does not have the personality , in order to implement effectively its office , and of 10 independent ones say that its temperament does not fit into the white house , thus ABC/post office to nearly six .
Republican voters get accustomed to the idea .
If they put their scholar hats on , Trump consider republican voter material .
If they are asked , who wins earliest the GOP nomination , it says four after a survey of CNN/ORC from the past week of ten that Trump is the best bet .
That is a change for the time , when four of ten at the end of July set their money on Jeb Bush .
Complete disclosure : GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past .
At this time in the last cycle four thought from ten republicans that Rick Perry would win the nomination opposite only 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
It shows up nevertheless that Trumps campaign view a variety of GOP voters as plausible .
Even if the republicans collected themselves around another candidate , Trump strikes still nearly everyone .
Some experts point out that the splintered field probably contributes to Trumps guidance , while the anti Trump support is vaguely distributed on more than one dozen of other candidates .
But a survey of the Monmouth University at the beginning of Septembers shows that in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race between Trump and most other republican candidates , Trump harvests the majority support .
It has 13 points lead , before Marco Rubio 14 points , before Carly Fiorina before Walker 15 points , before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points .
It is a neck-and-neck race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate , who strikes it ?
Ben Carson would overhaul the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race .
A limited majority of Donald Trump fans says that they formed their opinion .
A new survey of CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only somewhat more than half of the voters , who support Trump say that they assigned their voices firmly .
Naturally can happen much , in order to change , and nobody can really say to never change the opinion .
It said 46 percent that they leave the door open , in order to change to other candidates .
Nevertheless Trumps is strongest competition for the moment the other outsider , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters , who say that they formed their opinion , are twice as frequently for Trump .
Six of 10 republicans say that they agree with Trump with the topic immigration .
Since then Donald Trump in its election campaign speech two months ago immigrants from Mexico “ rapist ” called , was the immigration trick and pivot in the public discourse to 2016 .
Some it are anxious that the bombastic mode of expression will keep crucial hispanic away from Trump from the republican party and will damage the re-orientation efforts .
But after the new ABC/post office survey of Monday six say of 10 republicans that they agree with Trump with questions of the immigration .
As long as thus the immigration remains in the footlights , it will apparently also do to Donald Trump .
Frustration over the government climbs on new highest levels .
To Donald Trump and Ben Carson is allotted meanwhile approximately half of the support of republican voters , particularly by its outsider status .
Six of 10 republicans say in the new on Mondays survey of ABC/post office , it want rather a political outsider than someone with government experience .
And they are also furious on Washington .
A survey of the Moines register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three are frustrated by four Iowa republicans over the republicans in the congress , with 54 percent “ dissatisfied ” and 21 percent “ infernally annoyed ” .

Croatia : “ We leave the refugees through ”
“ Now the border controls are raised also at our southern borders ” , said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner .
Controls at the Hungarian border remain upright parallel to it .
Still it is clear that everyone , which wants to place a request for asylum can make also this “ natural ” .
The supply and security of humans are the center of attention .
Is clear in addition , “ that it clear signals needs ” , said the minister .
Humans must know that we do not accept boundless migration stream , also not about the Austrian-Slovenian border .
It needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considers “ passage ” - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had communicated before , also Slovenia wanted arriving refugees toward Austria and Germany further-travels to leave and perhaps also passages for the refugees to establish .
This Minister of the Interior did not see Vesna Györkös Znidar completely in such a way in loaf oh however .
The idea of passages is “ absolutely unacceptable ” , Slovenia rather the monitoring of the border - particularly to Hungary - will intensify .
The border with Croatia is however already strongly controlled as external border of the Schengen area .
How the minister stressed , Slovene thereby does not want to block its borders for refugees however .
“ Each EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system can not function ” , to stressed Györkös Znidar .
As the Croatian government communicated , the first refugees would have already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to enter in east Croatia the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid past in order to evade to the registration .
The Croatian police could take up it in the close corn fields .
According to local media since then constantly police vehicles with new refugees arrive in the Croatian Tovarnik .
Among them numerous women and children predominantly concern Syrians and Afghans .
Also emergency services and the red cross already are in the use .
In the coming days count his country on approximately 4000 refugees , said Ministers of the Interior Ranko Ostojic .
Besides buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border , which had brought so far Migranten to the Hungarian border , were rerouted direction Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday agreeing .
The government in Belgrade denied however that it was it , humans instructs to hit certain routes : “ Neither we can , nor we want to do this ” , it were said .
According to the media reports in the early a first bus arrived with approximately 50 refugees in the Serbian border town Sid , in the course of the day further buses was expected anyhow .
Over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The passengers had been the whole night of that approximately 500 kilometers of removed Macedonian border by Serbia on the way .
“ We heard that Hungary closed , therefore to us the police said that we are to drive ” , said to one of the refugees here .
They wanted to travel by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria further to Germany .
Thus it could actually come now to observers shift of the past Balkans route Turkey Greece Macedonia Serbia Hungary already predicted to a somewhat far distance lain west .
Croatia : “ Comprehensive possibilities for the border control ”
Of Croatia before Ministers of the Interior Ostojic it had stressed that its country had prepared corresponding plans for the case of a strong inflow of refugees for possible exceptional cases .
It did not call details , it referred however on the fact that Croatia had comprehensive possibilities for the border control ” as a non -- Schengen member “ .
One would drive through strict controls , around itself qualify for the membership in the Schengen area too .
Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , which issues EU partners the country since then throughout a good certification , which concerns the standard of the border controls .
On Serbian side further about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
According to Belgrade media reports they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Horgos , which leads after Röszke .
According to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain further completely closed .
Whether the remaining refugees want to further-travel now to the Croatian border , is still unclear .
The Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to still calm down Wednesday-early with a local inspection in Horgos : It hold the debates over alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is closed now , for prematurely .
It would not concern very high refugee numbers at present .
One can not say yet whether they would continue their travel over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Aides guess/advise dangerous - alternative routes to Migranten
However private Hungarian refugee aides began already to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes are drawn in by Croatia .
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless however : In parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war yet not vacated mine fields .
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team was sent by mine circular scrapers in the border area .

Marko Maksimovic , 29 , was one of the five men , who were arrested last month , after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay , which came from South America over Vanuatu and put on in August into Coomera .
Maksimovic was observed , how he later met his codefendants in the yachting port in the course of in the morning and in the café Coomera Roadhouse , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .

The Brexit camp ( Brexit = exit of Great Britain from the European Union ) could win at inlet , if the economy comes up to the year 2017 into a calm air
David Camerons 's ill-considered renegotiation strategy , in order to hold Great Britain in the European Union , with each day , even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy “ is it will more deeply in trouble turn out yes or no ? ” Corbyn to the leader of labour or the TUC , which fell out themselves because of Europe on Tuesday violently .
Foreigners have also their Corbyns and Nigel Farages .
A European diplomat friend said recently that some member states , into different crises , as the European Union it is as deeply involved just and not always from own debt , of Great Britain provided agenda with split concessions and disturbing contract modifications , which would mostly not like it are full .
In Brighton the TUC decided on its annual meeting that it does not like these also , if they endanger the social protection .
We could call Dave and Georges Selfie-Agenda it also .
Prime ministers and Ministers of Finance climb on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of itself before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come then home and say that it allied for reforms wins .
It always concerns me .
My European friend , after outside looking Great Britain inside the European Union-tent wishes - “ leave us not alone with France ” , says Berlin - and lets see through that more and more short-sighted Ministers and official came in some capitals up to the point , at which it them is all the same whether we remain or to go .
Of Germany carefully deliberated chancellor Angela Merkel is an allied one , but she is for 10 years at power and wants the office to leave , before it looks bad for her , as with long enduring exaggerated it such as Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) happened .
Of France François Hollande looks on his re-election or his replacement in the year 2017 .
It is also a fading strength .
Poland has possibly soon a nationalistic right government , Spain a left .
It falls heavily to introduce itself that they will peel themselves off a leg , to prevent in order to help the Selfie British , whose energy should be used better for it , Scotland withdrawal from the UK - something that it also not to want , because most similar separatist tendencies have .
Therefore possibly some such Ministers do not plan even intentionally helpful notes , completely in the SNP style , during of Great Britain referendum campaign 2017 , in order to accelerate the Brexit process , assume my friend .
“ The renegotiation was not a failure ” and “ Great Britain anything from value from the renegotiation won . ”
The Europeans know , how can be predatory Fleet Street at their expense and which European Union-sceptics the oligarchy of the press barons is , how they were it during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn 1975 however not , our entrance 1973 with a relationship of 2:1 supported .
They can itself weakly at Boris Johnson , whom remind ore euro-opportunist , who made itself a name as “ European Union-straight line-bananas ” a Brussels correspondent in the early 90 's .
With all its madness OD Miliband knew , who its enemies were .
In addition belonged the Medley of tax fear rogues , telephone-chopping foreigners and the pseudo non -- residents , who possess most of our large newspapers .
Actually Tony Blair thought similarly of it , it determined however that , if one sits with a hot gorilla in a cage one distributes better bananas to become in order to divert it , instead of its lunch and dinner .
Indeed was Miliband of more Blairianer than Blair themselves , than he opposed Cameron 's referendum eddies , because the principle had placed to Blair over the not adopted condition of the European Union , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in the year 2005 , who opened thereby a back door for him .
Die Presse also never forgave it .
But nice Jeremy Corbyn , that me on Monday in Westminster a friendly flip on the backs gave - I said to it that he no more time for me to waste need - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks 's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80 's an error at that time and today .
It can last , but it does not have to develop a coherent strategy , in order to win the media , with me , but surely with Andrew Marr , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyns official position to Europe actual I presses it times friendly out in the development .
He says that we should remain in a reformed European Union .
Now , which can probably say most humans outside of Ukips traditional woad tendency and the wilder realms of Torys Klein-Engländerismus to everyone to it yes .
It is what Hilary “ a Benn , but no Bennite ” Benn in the radio and on TV this week said , when the scout fought in him not to admit that Corbyns appointment of provoking John McDonnell was as shade chancellors a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 70 's , when its old father endeavored itself on TV to be disloyal opposite his labour colleagues from the cabinet without too far to go and its cabinet job lose .
Hilarys fight was still more attractive .
But to fight , in order to remain “ under all circumstances ” - Benns expression - what said McDonnell , was still which JC its fellow combatants and delegates after all reports on its closed conference on Monday evening told .
Whatever the tear-jerking Bottom UP image of Corbyn to arrange wants - to think it to the fact that it agitated even me - news discipline remains around the clock important and first of all in the age by TV in the vortex of the social media , a breeding place by paranoia and betrayal .
It is correct to give to Cameron no free ticket for Europe it permitted to hold Labours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course how McDonnell said it .
Simon Jenkins thinks surely in such a way .
But McDonnell and Corbyns basic ambiguities to EU membership - in conformity with its Bennite FE storage economy , her anti-capitalistic past - is no longer only one question of the esoteric discussion under left dissidents , for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes .
As with his ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC does not start a campaign to the withdrawal - foreign diplomats will be obligated to try in everything a sense for their superiors at home to find .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital to make - they have also distrustful voters - around concessions on the British if all of this can be senseless ?
The USA are already rather disappointed by the weak military achievement in Iraq , in Libya and in Syria , even with a reduction of costs of the Tory government at power , that I was reminded when starting on Monday by something , what British Influence Security forum called themselves .

Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis earns rather praise as criticism for its behavior .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one the “ collateral damage ” in the recent storm approximately around his friend Nick Kyrgios and earned in opinion of the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve Healy rather praise as criticism for its own behavior .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented Duos , which is designated again and again than “ special Ks ” , came by the notorious argument of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka with the Montreal of Masters into the footlights .
In a fiery qualification play in Cincinnati soon thereafter Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator , whereby Harrison proclaimed : “ Wawrinka would have had to strike Kyrgios , and I should strike the child . ”
While he was seen last , how he smashed a tennis racquet , after a cramp defeated a potential US-Open victory of Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis of Healy steadfast was defended .
The teenager is at present in Glasgow , in the competition with SAM Groth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain .
“ A thing , over which I get excited rather , is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi a little was pulled in into the controversy , ” said Healy .
It broke a racquet , when he lost because of a cramp into the US-Open , but he is not the first player , who broke a racquet from frustration with itself , and I know Thanasi well enough , in order to know that he is not proud on it .
But , really , he has himself into the US-Open extremely well held back , even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think that he earns much acknowledgment .
It has a great team around itself , it has a great family around itself , and I believe that he was a little too strictly treated .
It is very more ripely 19-year old , it works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he ever a problem with the other players had , he within the coat range was not respected , he trained hard , he is well in form , he is a very sturdy and matured young chap , and I believe , he earn it by its own earnings to be judged .
Healy supported also the decision not to consider Kyrgios during the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the “ common decision ” as the correct for all , but he assures to the man from Canberra to return as a long-term firm component to the team . ”
“ First we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the controversies [ Kyrgios ] , ” it said approximately to Healy .
And I believe that nod very fast the ascent created , on which people referred such as Federer and Murray . It rises in the eyes of the public , and he has some bad errors made and earned all the criticism , which he gets , but we to try to support it we to try , to make for it the consequences of its acting understandable . Some consider time outside of the footlights , in which he can only think about it , I appropriate , and it is best for the crew and it is the best for it .

On their to most expected conference in the year Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week approximately around a 27-Fuß Honduras Mahagoni table sitting , in order to decide , whether it is time , to raise for the first time for nearly one decade the key interest .
Threateningly over them at an end of the decorated , two-floor meeting room is a mural of the United States .
The map is a memory to the fact that the Fed chairmen Janet L. Yellen and its colleagues before all other things is to set the economic interests of the nation .
The central bank has a double order of the congress : Maximization of the US-occupation and prices here keep stable .
But since the large recession the Fed recognized leaders that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
And this third mandate could the X-factor in a decision is , which is too close , in order to predict it . It will be cured on Thursday announced , whether the U.S. economy is ready for launch , by the unprecedented incentive by the close short term interest rate which is because of zero since end of 2008 .
Although most data of the economy show the fact that them grow solidly could make the recent turbulences at the global financial markets the already careful Fed representatives fearful to strengthen this volatility by the rise of the interest for government securities - and is it only around for quarters a percentage point .
“ Obvious will be the job market and the inflation primarily the most important , which they observe , said ” Lindsey M. Piegza , Chefökonomin with the brokerage firm Stifel Nico louse & CO .
“ However I think , if they were in the search for a pretext , for not increasing the interest rate am the increased uncertainty approximately around the global market enough justification , further to wait ” , said her .
There is no consent over it , which will do the Fed , what actually the financial market disconcerted .
About half of the economists , who were asked recently by Bloomberg , to have an increase in interest this week predicted .
The financial markets expect however a awaiting of the Fed , with a key indicator , which only an opportunity shows 30 % on an increase .
This points to a decrease of the stock market , if the Fed increases the sentence , unless the strategists reduce the impact , by promising that a further increase is far distant .
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average value jumped around 228,89 points or around 1,4 % on 16.599 , 85 .
The action by expectations released that the Fed politics maintain the sentence this week , said John Lonski , Chefökonom with Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise , if the Fed would lift the sentences at this time ” , said it .
If she does it , “ she would have to go in her explanation very far , in order to calm down the financial markets , thereby her in panic did not turn out . ”
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets down , because it would eliminate the uncertainty over it , when the Fed will act .
Still one month ago the Fed seemed on good way to increase the sentence by 0,25 percentage points in this month the first small step in a slow aggravation of the monetary conditions , which the strength of the recovery in the USA would test .
Yellen in spring and in the early summer had said that she expects an increase of the sentence in this year despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be necessary .
Although the job creation slowed down in August , the improvement on the job market was solid in this year .
The unemployment ratio sank on 5,1 % in the past month , the lowest for more than seven years and in the proximity of the level , which the Fed views as full employment .
Increases of wages showed signs of a recovery .
And although the inflation constantly ran under the full year target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed representatives said that the principal reason was the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices .
The economy “ can master higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the job market ” , said Ian Shepherdson , executive economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics .
But the financial markets around the world winced end of last month , after China had devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones Industrial average value fell in May around more than 16 % under its highest level , than investors feared that a slowing down of the Chinese economy global growth would throttle .
The market recovered in this month something , whereby the Dow is now around nearly 10 % under the high from May .
For the Fed representatives the market turbulences affect the complex calculation , when one is to increase the interest .
“ If the events on the financial markets and the news over the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have arisen to Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve Bank in the last few weeks , them in this meeting the reins would tighten ” , said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman center for .
Now it forecasts that she will wait at least one month , in order the effects better into the grasp to get .
“ There is a quantity uncertainty over it , which the effects will be on the U.S. economy , and there are nearly no reliable data , which describe the developments in China , ” said Oliner .
The health of the world economy is not of the main objectives of the Fed , therefore it should not be included technically during her decision making .
But eventually the Fed became currency authority of the world .
The influence of the central bank was enormous in the last years .
The bare reference of the leader at that time Ben S. Bernanke in the year 2013 that the Fed “ narrows ” its monetary expansion could , released confusion around the globe .
In a world , in which markets and national economies are increasingly intertwined with one another , it can be expected by the Fed representatives that they do not only supervise the developments in other place , but itself also with other central banks and experts in an advisory manner , in order to receive a better understanding for the global economy .
Their decision making is “ more art than science , ” said Zachary Karabell , Leiter of the global strategy for the fortune management of the company Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , Präsident of Federal Reserve bank OF Richmond , VA. , noticed this month that “ the Fed has a history of over reactions to financial market movements , those with apparently not with the economical fundamental data is linked . ”
Lacker , enfranchised member of the federal open Market Committee , de for an increase in interest uses itself , quoted decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower their key interest around 0,75 percentage points in three meetings “ despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the USA ” said Lacker .
Later the Fed representatives these shortening cancelled one year .
The Fed should to be set aspects of financial stability only during a heavy crisis as for the market collapse 2008 to the first place , said Adam S. Posen , former member of the committee for the interest definition of the bank OF England .
The recent turbulences come not into the proximity of this level , said it .
“ Does not want to come you surely into the situation , in which it has fear of an increase in interest , because the markets excite themselves , said ” Posen , Präsident of Peterson Institute for internationally Economics .
Federal Reserve act contains still the double mandate and does not mention not financial stability , and to which it is changed believes I not that it should precede the time .

Peter Moody stated that stewards tried , it to spy and threatens to terminate racing
Peter Moody stated that stewards of Racing Victoria tried , in passed the year a spy in its stables to install and threatened to terminate a running immediately .
It aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and stated the fact that her a personal campaign against it with the Late Scratching of lady Tatai because of a running daily treatment who on Wednesday , accomplished last straw .
Moody said fair fax Media that he had always tried to do what for racing is best and he had found himself under difficult conditions , when it concerned the positive cobalt swab sample with Lidaris , which it can not explain .
It had held back itself and did not want 18 months because of the espionage reproaches not that it looks “ as too highly hanging clusters . ”
“ I intended to say nothing in addition and I had for a long time sat on it , but you are so frustrated sometimes that everything comes out , said at once ” Moody .
They know that it continued .
Sometimes one reacts , and one must live with the consequences , and I must live thereby which I said .
I will this evening home go and well will sleep .
I would like to go around edifying head , and I would like that my owners think that I try my best for her .
If they begin to think , I do that not , then I should not be any more coach .
I must consider then , what I do with my license .
Before Moody had left the bomb in an interview with racing.com lift-off that the integrity department had tried to spy its stable .
“ Eighteen months ago sat Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in an area with a man - whom I will designate , if I am asked - and offered him an occupation in my stables , around information about what I do within my stables , to supply ” , said Moody on Racing.com .
They obviously believe that I am a cheat .
If that is the case , they should surely seize themselves to their noses , because them with the attempt to seize me to have failed .
Robert Roulston , ehem . chairmen of the RVL , David Moodie , acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of the RVL , were conscious itself of its at the time and are it still today .
Should that bring me to the opinion that it becomes personal ?
Did the RVL hold back and does make themselves cowardly perhaps people outside responsible for from coaches which proceeds in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I so bad for the industry ?
Perhaps the people think there outside that I am it .
Perhaps they must to me my license take and me offend , and I do not have a doubt that what I say lets her think now about it .
But I arrived now at the point , at which that is all the same to me , and which makes me sadly .
That makes me really sad .
I will exert the pressure on it and her urge to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The frustration levels of the coach developed themselves with the long persisting cobalt investigation with Lidari , and it led the Late Scratching to the fact that he said that he could throw “ its license over the table . ”
Moody , best admits by its preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar , designated the running tag treatment rule “ ridiculously ” , after a packing mud or tone had been laid on on the horse legs , what against the rules offended .
“ It is against the rules of racing .
I must take for it the full responsibility ” , said he .
“ One of my employees has erroneous-proves mud on the leg laid on .
It could have like that been last night .
It could have like that been yesterday all day long , which also like that was .
It had it in addition , so on the running day .
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the packing on the running day . An investigation of this affair was opened .
It is a joke .
Humans , who set up these rules , do not know anything about the horse .
“ We all see that we need rules , but one too far went here ” , said Moody .

Terraced houses for refugees , single parent , low income earner
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for humans , who do not have much money in the Middle Franconian corner valley .
Thus approximately for refugees - in addition , as signal : “ Not only refugees need Wohnhraum , but likewise the single mother and the low income earners . ”
“ I show , as one also today well to still favorably and build can ” , say to the 44-year old in the interview
Thousands of refugees become on the housing market urge .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know , how rapidly favorable dwelling can be created : He builds terraced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gildner , many refugees become on the housing market urge .
Which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The massive accommodation in containers or gymnasia does not have sustainability .
Because humans remain to a large part here .
In view of the stream of refugees we need sufficient dwelling also in the next decades .
A completely banal , three-story terraced house is the solution .
Gildner : A terraced house needs at few the place .
It facilitates the integration .
That is different , if one accommodates humans in blocks of flats .
Everyone of the six houses , which are built straight in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for in each case four asylum seekers .
Each housing unit has two bedrooms , a bath , a kitchen and a lounge .
It can be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I decreases .
Then the houses can be converted easily after the respective needs .
Are the costs how high ?
Gildner : The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros , without property .
That is visible .
Six months the building took .
That is appropriate .
Did the construction specifications their plans complicate ?
Gildner : Building-legally I pulled my project through correctly .
It always makes the threatening sword of Damocles special 's building and the parking bay regulation particularly complicated .
Gruesome one .
It is still subordinated , who creates three apartments in a terraced house , needs at least three parking bays .
Only in the cities for it the place is missing .
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
How did the adjacents resident react to their terraced house project ?
Gildner : It gave which , has me accused those to create buildings of luxuries for asylum seekers .
Which is not correct definitely .
But you do not intensify the competition around payable apartments ?
Gildner : True is nevertheless : We had a boom of construction activity in Germany in the last five years , but were built luxury dwellings , which hardly one can afford more .
My project has the message , also normal humans needs dwelling .
Not only refugees , but likewise the single mother or the low income earners .
I show , how one can build also still today favorably and well .
Therefore it goes .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied micro-system technology in Regensburg and concerned themselves first with environmental analyses .

Why so some woman comes at the sight of a beautiful handbag into ecstatic trance , also the expert can not answer with absolute certainty .
Perhaps it is because of the fact that a beautiful bag revalues each outfit .

Jeremy Corbyn 's debut in the Time of the Prime Minister
Since his election , Mr Corbyn 's eagerly awaited debut in the Time of the Prime Minister
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in the Time of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Corbyn will probably rise up to make the first of his six preset questions shortly after midday , with his performance of the media and the Labour MP for the area will be examined .
He called for `` less theatrical and more facts '' at this weekly event .
He has also said that he might skip some sessions to be left to colleagues .
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn 's leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet , and after his speech to the TUC 's annual meeting on Tuesday .
In the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday to remain in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has provoked criticism from a number of Tory most recent and is at the heart of several covers stories in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyn 's decision not to sing the national anthem , has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he had `` been in a respectful silence '' and he had `` recognised the '' heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain .
But a member of Mr Corbyn 's shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader , to sing the national anthem , `` independent '' of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn 's top team , and they are called to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him initially as a leader .
The BBC 's political correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences are also within Labour 'stack ' after Mr Corbyn 's remarks to the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits .
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour amendments on the table to remove the whole idea of a limitation in total .
Hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister , said that the party was `` very clear '' that it was only against the government plans to reduce the cap of £26,000 to £23,000 .
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman of the Tory leader David Cameron , since he is , in the last decade across the Dispatch Box in the House .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says that he has `` crowd sourced '' ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 comments .
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister 's Question Time is too confrontational , and that he will do both `` repartee '' and arguing with barbs and instead made to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality , and the challenges for young people .
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business minister will represent him , if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
He has also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues speak from time to time , and that he raised , John Bercow , the Speaker of the House of Commons , in order to discuss the problem .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove themselves from the policy in the style of an `` opinion '' theater , which is often linked to the Time of the Prime Minister , but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it .
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and its position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that she had become a caricature and needs major reform .

Why I will be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man being put to death .
If it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma state penitentiary , when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection .
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
The invitation was already on his best friend for the first time in January , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day was nearing , I began to fear me .
So , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would provide a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists can see executions in the United States , and as many more applications than places available , will take place a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
Anyone who is selected , it will observe without emotion .
I can not do that .
I will sit alongside Richard Glossips inner friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a visit to two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we are talking about .
The prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I must simply try to remind me of all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me to abandon my impartiality on Twitter .
Here is the lesson .
Tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you get access .
I complained to her .
They admitted that they `` can make it better , '' but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glossip had problems with some of the things that I have said and written .
He tells me not what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter is present , in order to write .
When he dies , he thinks that will help the public relations of the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell , a reporter for the Huffington Post , is sitting next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts that I have made .
I am not going to go back on all the details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty , to be a beneficiary of the deed .
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from this perspective , I will see him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters , to whom you can turn for this .
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die a needless death .

Now that Viktor Orbán sends many thousands more to us , is a logical outcome of a hypocritical policy :
Instead of in Röszke camp immediately to help with the construction of structures that ensure humanity our chancellor has high officially and publicly brought the attitude of the Hungarian government to the orbit of National Socialism .
Victim of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
The area also will have to say that the `` promised land '' that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing more than another refugee camp .
It will be a great challenge for us , given the ongoing refugee flows and the onset of winter , produce decent conditions for asylum seekers .
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .

This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
A rate hike is coming , and the boom will falter , bond yields will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
We know that .
What we do not know how long it would take and how long it will last .
In particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the end .
A recession came within just 11 months after the first rate hike and took 86 months .
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , but not always , a factor , such as the economy and the financial assets .
As a result , representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather on the period which is needed for the normalization .
In fact , several variables play a role .
In the end , market participants could say , however , that all the excitement was due to an increase in interest rates may be overdone .
`` The Fed 's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of '' cheap money `` , '' said Julian Jessop , chief economist at Capital Economics , in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to normal levels , but still too low to conduct a seismic shock many seem to fear .
This does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
Here is a look based on historical trends , as some sectors of the economy might respond :
As the market has seen in the last month , the anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
As soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
`` There appears to be a tendency that asset returns are strangled 12 to 24 months after the first hike , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , '' said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed 's rate hikes .
More specifically , the market is mostly in the upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike , pretty flat for the next 250 days ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average return of 14.4 per cent in the past six past cycles , according to a recent analysis , the Bob doll , chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , published in Barron 's .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the growth cycle and begin the return to reduce .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but they often promote interest rate increases .
In the current case , the Fed is faced with a number of conditions that did not exist before and which could hasten a recession .
Most remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a Fed rate hike .
According to Deutsche Bank was at 118 rate hikes since 1950 only nominal GDP twice under 4.5 percent .
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent in the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed .
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question , `` whether it is different this time , '' Deutsche Bank said .
Market participants have taken throughout the year on a Fed rate hike , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session , the futures trading is only a 25 percent chance .
`` In our study , all increase cycles have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP from 1950 to the present day and put on - recession highs very soon after the start of the recovery in the shadows , '' according to the report .
By contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
The current cycle is by far the longest , which the Fed has maintained since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
The fixed income was also on the market as volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase , and the pattern is pretty similar .
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than that of stocks , if they change their strategic course .
With bond yields seem to change the direction , as soon as the first increase / decrease takes place in the cycle .
Bond yields fall at the end of the growth cycle , Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Schwab 's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will mean that yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve .
Higher income often bring better returns in such a climate , although `` we are still cautious to expect higher yields , '' said Kathy Jones , fixed income analyst at Schwab , in an analysis .
Interestingly , Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , '' she wrote .
Short term rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , lending margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightened its strategy .
By and large companies that handle the greater part of their business in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of its debt as well .
`` History shows that '' quality `` stocks tend to react , three months after an initial rate hike in a very positive way , '' Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients .
Companies with a strong balance sheet companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points .
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 percentage points each ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debt is a big problem .
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Goldman said .
Outside of pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
Savers could see profits through higher yields , although experts disagree , how quickly that will take place .

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy proposes ring to fight back against rivals because of allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism at the tack of his players as `` agenda setting '' by two Premier League favorites of the NRL .
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have allowed the Storm players `` ring '' struggles with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team , after his team had reached the final victory against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night . He called the game a `` model '' of the rugby league and said that the two from Queensland were not `` too good '' in the struggle .
Bellamy , the Tacklimg defended his team and said that they were at the tack , focusing only on their `` contact '' .
Bellamy added that the criticism of the two leading trainers on his team made him confident agree , because it means that they are concerned , to be beaten by the Storm team .
`` It appears over and over again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling fights , as they have beaten us 24 : 2 , '' Bellamy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that , throughout the year , we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus , and this has been the trend for us .
Trent is now there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . He is therefore probably not accustomed to lose , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
It is funny how this appears again and again at this time of year .
Bellamy has attacked the Bennett 's idea of `` exciting football '' and recalled his mentor , that Bennett 's St George Illawarra dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with `` long because a '' football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting the game was , `` Bellamy said .
I remember that in 2010 , St George has been criticised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he is a shit dirt will look into this matter .
But now he has a team that can play and that we regard as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
This is the ball game that you want to play , if you have these kind of players .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play the kind of football that everyone - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like this .
I build stronger confidence , because they say these things , because they are a bit concerned , having to play against us .
Six weeks ago , they have probably not thought of us , when it came to the big games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against Roosters reached a higher result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys .
The Broncos game was a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but this is an exciting game ?
Or breaks and no points are a little bit more exciting ?
For me , it is the game plans .
If you mention us , it means that we will meet in a stage on it .
The Storm team has this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks in the Vorfinale at AAMI Park on Saturday night . The ticket sale starts from next Tuesday morning .

Last month there was the lowest result since the records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday has curbed spending in November

The total spending for August , the lowest increase in growth , the lowest since records began in 2000 with only five per cent increase over the previous year .
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnant , after new figures indicate only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
`` If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has developed in the course of time , '' said Andy Mulcahy , editor of the Guardian IMRG sales index .
He explained that the online sales increased from three years ago , when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
It meant that more people were able to shop online , and that people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa .
But now the commute , and we will probably experience reduced growth .
The Black Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for declining sales .
Experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place each year on the last Friday in November , .
Last year rallied five times the average number of buyers for their computer to make their bargains and some dealer websites plummeted .
Experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer is fighting for bargains , could deter buyers to make purchases .
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that spending just over £1 of £5 was spent online .
For some products such as televisions and washing machines , more than a third of the purchases are now done via web shops .
More than a quarter of the people at the same time buying clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .

In an emergency , a professor admits to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency , Professor Shannon lamb with a slightly tremulous voice told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb , it was important to stress that his `` sweet dog '' but still live and probably was excited , and he said that the families of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
Inside the house , the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block was : `` To me , it does so sorry , I wish I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . '' This was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by lamb .
There was no indication that lamb that taught online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , two had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he has a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt , according to the police shot and killed at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Wednesday said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 pm .
He said that lamb has made the fatal emergency sometime after that .
By the end of the day , there was another death : Einkesselte lamb life , as the police took him .
A day after the shootings at the university , the students and staff forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still are trying to get a picture of it , what motivated lamb .
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state , as well as the students and staff who knew him , Burmese , helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
Students said that they were on his teaching .
The police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said that he had no history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt himself had lamb mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the `` beautiful people '' with whom he shared his academic life .
Both taught in the department of social sciences and history , which includes 17 faculty members , and many students attended classes from both .
At the same time , there have been some inclinations to problematic behaviors .
A student , Brandon Beavers , praised the lamb said he seemed a little too excited and nervous , `` as if something was wrong with him . ''
Mikel Sykes , another student , said that lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 / 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
Recent changes in the university 's employment policies meant that the promotion for the lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor .
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course , there was something in Mr lambs idea . ''
These are questions that lamb can no longer answer .
After the escape from the campus police later found lambs track , when he returned to Mississippi arriving from Arkansas .
Before he could be arrested , killed lamb selbstmit a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said .
His car was still in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why lamb came to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy .
He holds a PhD in education in the spring .
One of the lambs of longtime friends described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met through mutual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who a few years tried to teach her the guitar playing .
At that time , it was the women flock .
All the girls melted away , if he was , `` said Hairston , now 40 and living in the suburb of Brandon Jackson .
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together .
In the emergency , lamb said `` I have killed my wife , '' but there was no certificate of marriage .
They had a dog named Lightning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier .
The police said that the dog was in order .
The former husband of Prentiss , Shawn O Steen , said that she had been divorced for 15 years , but have remained friends and had a daughter , now 19 years old .
`` She was totally devastated , '' said O Steen about his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O Steen said he had never met lamb , but by his daughter Abigail , he heard that lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both at a summer fair three years ago .
Later , they played one or the other gig together .
O Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Juleps Room , a poorly lit bar near Gautier , said that he had lamb and Prentiss Night at the end of the night saw 5 September for the last time , after lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience .
There was no indication that anything is wrong .
`` Just a happy couple , '' he said .
We were in the cleanup efforts and joking with each other .
I think they both had a good sense of jokes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee .
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland , took part in a candlelight ceremony on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including faculty , staff , students and members of the community .
Schmidt 's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vigil , during the Universitätschor sang `` bright Morning Star '' and `` amazing Grace . ''
Classes will resume on Wednesday .
`` We are trying to move our students to return home , '' said LaForge .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
The Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency Prentiss has described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

BBC should give up EastEnders , says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice . He said that commercial rivals `` would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used , in order to make the kind of programmes , which will not be sent by other UK broadcasters .
He criticised the BBC for having to place public service programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , for solid window against their rival 's most popular shows and channels such as BBC4 .
After the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried , without success , to get in touch with the BBC in his time at Channel 4 for six years .
`` I would have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sends , which is also clearly shown by not subsidized rivals , '' Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry on the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which in the medium or long term , I do not think it is a good idea , you should commission its production at least or with programs that others do not .
They send The Voice in a prime time slot , because they want to reach the broadest possible support for their future .
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous , it is , of course , nonsense .
Johnson said : `` I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could also be funded without subsidies .
The Voice is such a programme , EastEnders is another , admittedly both own productions .
To be honest , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I am doing my best to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of ratings because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long term support. ``
His comments on the BBC 's most popular programmes that give back to what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows such as EastEnders .
Johnson said that public service rather niche programs `` should go to BBC4 , where you can pretty much do not measure the audience , but they are doing their work , and they can argue that if they go on missions to justify broadcasting fees of £4 billion of their hypocritical , '' Well , of course , we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. ``
They put them in a window in which no one would ever see it .
The broadcasting fee Johnson told the committee : `` I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
Thinking of you all , of course , we all think that one gets a great value for £150 per year here , but for people who for £150 is a lot of money , wonder if that is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
The former Sky and Channel 5 - chief executive David Elstein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission `` to inform , educate and entertain . ''
He said that little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education , he said that there were 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should be making an example of public service television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to `` inform , educate and entertain . ''
On the issue of partnerships Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , which he said that only a handful will be shown on television , and enter into alliances with the commercial channels , in order to make everything available online .

The woman , in The bachelor 's Sam Wood ends up at the end of the day , was wrapped in the greatest secrecy .
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether it is the one that has received the final rose .
But when we are with Sarah MacKay , Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons fellows a day before two out of three , eincheckten , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the finale on Thursday
All three women have left themselves in a lyrical way about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
However , if the question , `` If not you , who should receive Woods last rose ? , '' their responses to the spoiler could be who won the heart of the theory .
Jeavons - fellows and Markoski called both quickly - except themselves - MacKay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah MacKay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with each other from day one .
`` Energy from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sarah 's ) and Sams said , because I felt that they were quite compatible , and I have thought this throughout the course of the show , '' said Jeavons - fellows .
`` Sarah stands with both feet on the ground , it is so much fun to be together with her , '' Markoski added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
They feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah MacKay believes that she and Sam Wood would be suitable as a couple .
From their point of view , MacKay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood could be 'The One ' .
`` As soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now fully prepared for him , '' she said .
And when she was asked , should choose whom Wood , if not it as it was puzzling .

Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns ( gilt ) is one of the main works Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not in the Otmar Alt Bible now appeared with beautiful images .
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt , who has formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
His `` language '' with bright colors and imaginative forms has received the 75 years old - but by no means is synonymous with `` funny '' pictures .
On the contrary , adapted to the particular issues , it may well seem rather bleak .
Around three years , Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project , for which he has taken from the many areas of the `` book of all books '' a subjective artistic choice .
The result are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as crossroads , plagues , bids or Our Father .
He is fascinated on several partners : This applies to the Lutheran publisher with its theological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books .
And there is , above all , the author Klaus Altepost who has dealt with the relevant biblical passages on the basis of painting .
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and so on Today , `` translated '' in the current context .
These texts are like verbal mirror of Alts painting .
They are between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one sentence each of the artist , who has put his own personal thoughts on the current situation .
The jewelry box has golden letters .
This allows the 75 year - old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high level of intimacy .
Emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible Project : Otmar Alt , born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Christmas orders at all .
`` Since the education with the cane ever happened , '' recalls Otmar Alt .
`` I have tried to do the father come to me perhaps again with the Lord . ''
His second concern was to help the art at the time passes back to more importance : `` The perception of worlds is now dominated by advertising , and is loud .
Symbolism is out there .
Artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
`` In this regard , I am a dinosaur . ''
Otmar Alt would discover that the viewer into the images ' fall ' , they can act on it , and feel what power they have : `` The picture is his counterpart . ''
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation , `` always been '' a lover of Otmar Alts art : `` I like how he sees life with his pictures . ''
Age did not care to fully comprehend the Bible , but are important to him , also selected mysterious issues .
`` This was no cooperation on an equal footing , '' all old post explained : `` This is about the images , the text says . '' The result is a picture Bible .
For Hans Möhler from publishers Luther is this work to find an invitation , `` to deepen his life and freedom . ''
Otmar Alts images speak for Möhler both the responsibility and the ( biblical ) language of love .
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which opened on November 15 in the Otmar Alt Foundation .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : `` We create that ''
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
What comes to Germany ?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany is even capable of a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has shown determination in light of the unusual challenge : `` I say again and again : We can do it , and we do that . ''
What is in store for Germany gives the following overview .
Homes a year are needed for different forecasts between the Bundesbauministeriums 350000 ( estimate ) and 400,000 ( estimate of Pestel Institut ) - and in the next five years .
This is almost twice as much as before is built choices ( housing ) .
Dramatically , the lack of housing but especially for affordable rental properties : Every year , there are 60,000 to 80000 social housing out of the rental price fixing , and this particularly affordable housing refugees will also apply .
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) will therefore double the promotion , from currently $ 518 million to one billion euros .
Far too little is that from the point of view of the Pestel Institute : Social housing 80 000 a year would have to occur and that the federal government would have to invest in a promotion to the tune of $ 6.4 billion per year .
Scientists and federal construction minister agree on is that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it can be assumed that 55 per cent of the area in the long term can be employed in Germany .
However , the refugees in Germany would not systematically asked for their qualifications , in order to help them get started , criticises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation .
For the integration of refugees , however , is crucial , whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the host society , but also for the self - esteem of immigrants , says migration for Cher Dietrich Thränhardt .
In Germany , there has been a political change according to Thränhardt : The ban on work for refugees on the recognition of work .
While there was a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years in the past , this was limited to three months , as well as the residence requirement , the asylum seekers at a residence in November 2014 .
In society - also due to the lack of skilled workers - mostly the view prevailed that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market more quickly .
A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of German language skills .
So far there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
Studies also show that jobs are most commonly transmitted through personal contacts .
The construction of networks is the royal road to integration work according to Thränhardt .
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few parents give their children in the key signature , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : `` For the uprooted parents only once , it is very important to keep the family together , '' says Ilya Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department .
The family still to be convinced of the benefits of this option , the administration distributed hand slip in different languages .
Should the need for educators to rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example , by allowing multiple schools .
In those countries , students are not prepared to welcome classes on the teaching of English .
But they are not always aware of fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , including from teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language .
There is no shortage of them , says Beate Stoffers Schulverwaltung from Berlin .
The Deutsches Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle , no state prohibits asylum seekers or patience , the study - the only exception has been Berlin , Senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now given up his attitude .
Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitating access to university .
For refugees with a residence permits or more if they begin a study of asylum seekers will receive no benefits under the current law .
The latter are generally no Bafög , since they do not fall within the circle of people entitled to trainees .
CADTM refugees have so far had to have lived in Germany for four years , to be Bafög - justified , in that span is shortened to 15 months from 1 January 2016 .
This funding gap needs to be closed , however , claim crash , Berlin 's undersecretary for science , and the Deutsches Studentenwerk Steffen .
The students should receive Bafög .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should give the same rights to Islam gradually as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state religions relationship .
It would also be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association of professional cares about the new arrivals .
Belong to the rights and obligations .
As the representative of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and to give him some control .
This includes the willingness to take bold action against religious fundamentalism .
Ayman Mazyek , the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany on Thursday .
Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany `` have forfeited their right to dwell here , in Germany , immediately , '' he said in the Bavarian Radio .
He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
Integration will be much more than an issue of the whole society today in the future .
It will also have to change the majority of society , will be pressing the elimination of discrimination and racism .
Germany has a point against discrimination and a general equality law - as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade .
But it learns very slowly , as the spirits - murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
Equal opportunities for all , not white German immigrant organizations and interest groups have been demanding and what international agreements such as the Anti Racism Convention oblige Germany needs to become a reality in the next few years , if the country remain peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities , for the benefit of all .
In general , Germany is able to supply the refugees expected to date medically , says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
`` With regard to MAN power and capabilities , we create it , '' he told the daily mirror .
However , should make extra money flowing into the system .
In order to avoid bottlenecks , calls for Montgomery , hand over all arrivals for the registration of health cards .
Services provided could be charged later with the provinces .
And in the long term , it is highly questionable to mislead so many people with a limited catalog of performance , the performance of the asylum law propose .
Otherwise , the doctors are , above all , to create the language barriers .
So far , it has proven the Berlin Gesundheitswissenschaftlerin Thea Borde , migrants are less aware of their disease than other patients .
Not only in hospitals , but also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be accepted , she asks .
Many refugees would have helped but even with more general medical correspondents in emergency ambulances .
And with another diagnostic views .
Among refugee children , for example , will give it much more unprocessed disability , and go to HIV awareness among young people .
German doctors came with the images of some other disease in terms of their education but clear , says Montgomery .
`` Parasite infections and tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect . '' And as regards the shortage of doctors is perhaps even relief in sight by the refugees .
The Syrians have a highly developed education system , many refugees are even doctors .
In order to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their skills , however , and may once again professional examinations .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill , according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of psychotherapists ( BPtK ) : Most are suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable , Dietrich Munz , President of BPtK explains .
A recently published study of the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child traumatized in Germany .
Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder is ill , including so called flashbacks with breathlessness , dizziness , and palpitation Todesängsten .
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong shock and emotional numbness .
In order to prevent the symptoms were chronic , early treatment is needed , Munz said .
So far , only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy .
Mentally ill asylum seekers in social services can make a request for psychotherapy , but the process usually takes several months .
Most clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , in social services would also decide whether or not a therapy is necessary .
This often leads to misjudgments , Munz said .

The pressure on the housing market is growing .
Social housing is a challenge .

With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many cities .
They compete with low income citizens in the last affordable housing .
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing , would need to be built each year 400,000 new units by 2020 .

This is a lack of 140,000 homes .
Refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a reception accommodation after the first three months of their stay .

If the plans are implemented , then all of nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in Albania .
The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the still existing inside station .
The rooms are available .
The staff who can not to Schongau is expected to be offered a job in Weilheim , Jochner - White .
The employees were informed of the plans .
Triggered the switch changes the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder , who is medical director of the city hospital only since the beginning of the year and now at a private practice in the more immediate vicinity of the hospital .
On the question of who should take the succession came into play according to Jochner - white , the name `` fishermen '' who agreed to take the line on 1 October , and with his team to switch to Schongau .
For the house in Schongau means that in each case an `` appreciation '' and an expansion of the offer in the area of `` internal medicine , '' so Jochner - White .
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators .
Schongau ( 180 beds ) specializes in the Inner Station on gastroenterological diseases .
Fischer and his team is on track for the next two years , if the board agrees to hold both houses until then the former hospital in the next year the shortage , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed permanently in Albania after nearly 140 years .
So far , the district had this planned for 2018 , when the current renovation is completed at the hospital of Weilheim .
Landrätin Jochner - White , who is also chairman of the supervisory board , came rumors that the house , located in the possession of the Bundesknappschaft should in future be used as accommodation for Asylbeweber .
`` I support that . '' As it continues with the property , Jochner - White could not say that there are a number of considerations .
A short term care of Caritas , there are currently housed a day psychiatry .
`` What better things could not happen , such an opportunity comes on the virtual parade at the Lech , which has been accepted by the employees '' positive and very understanding `` not again , '' says Fischer .
A real prospect for the house in which fishermen for more than 30 years working as a chief doctor , it did not exist .
He had been asked by city colleagues , to assume the post of medical director .
The hospital once Albania ( 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened with closure , departments have been closed in recent decades , for example , the obstetrician and surgery .

Time of the decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world observes , if the Fed comes together in two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decisions , whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade .
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that only last week was of the view that the Fed will do so , now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent .
It is a historic event , because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero .
`` For the first time , we are moving towards a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero field and start a process of normalisation of interest rates , '' said Angel Ubide , Senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The US economy is on a relatively good performance , trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
However , the Fed can not ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions .
She has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the evidence suggests that the odds are well against such a move .
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8pm CET

UN chief says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki Moon says that his response to Russia 's increased military support for Syria is : `` There is no military solution '' to the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people .
The UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers `` make this situation intractable . ''
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have shown in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran .

Refugees have free passage : Croatia and Slovenia a corridor
After Hungary is practically no longer go through , as more and more people choose the path of Croatia .
Zagreb announces to provide the transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles .
Yet the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbour Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
`` I have spoken with the Slovenian Interior Minister , and if it is necessary , we will organise a corridor , '' said the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko politics .
Located between Croatia and Austria , Slovenia is already part of the Schengen zone .
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
After the closure of the Serbian - Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees to Croatia are broken , to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people had come over the border in Tovarnik , reports the Croatian television channel RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees the day before .
New laws , which came into force on the same day , also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually redundant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said : `` You can travel through , and we are preparing for that possibility . ''
These people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
But there were people who did not want to live in Croatia .
The Croatian police had picked up on the morning of the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour Croatia .
Most were from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan , according to media reports .
They came with both bus and taxis in the Serbian border town of Sid .
Immediately after their arrival they would have tried to reach on foot on the green border to Croatia .
On the Croatian / Serbian border the refugees not to border fences .
For the border strip carries other risks : There are still active mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s .
Minesweepers are now rapidly to create a safe passage .
Come to Hungary , however , little more refugees after the closure of the border .
On Tuesday , the police apprehended 366 people .
Just before close of play on Monday , it was still water .
The new Hungarian laws classify the damage and the removal of the border fence as a crime .
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged , 35 were therefore initiated criminal proceedings .
Those convicted face prison sentences of up to five years and the expulsion from the country .
According to the immigration authority you have received a total of 94 asylum applications in the new `` transit zones '' set up at the border on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition Röszke .
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
On Wednesday morning , there 40 refugees had stopped .
In practice , however , is no longer a prospect to get asylum in Hungary .
According to Hungarian view , Serbia is a `` safe third country . ''
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported .
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the `` transit zone '' in Röszke .
In Röszke started cleaning up for workers .
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks had left at the side of the road .
Sperrgitter were dismantled and one of the detention centre in the border town has been rebuilt .

Four times revenue increase of hand disinfectant by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States report on a nearly 400 % increase in the number of children under the age of 12 , swallow the strong alcoholic hand disinfectant , so the Georgia poison Center .
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , director of the Georgia poison Center report , increased the cases of revenue of hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12 , the poison control centers , from 3,263 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014 .
`` Children are more and more of these products , and , unfortunately , ends up with a percentage of them going to the emergency room , '' Lopez told CNN .
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose , while some do it to impress their friends or because Mutprobe in social media .
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectant only because of a cheap experience .
Young people have allegedly disinfectants mixed with alcoholic mouth water to get a tougher drink .
Younger children can be enticed by attractive smells of disinfectant .
`` A child does not , that this is bad for it , '' Lopez said .
Many of the more attractive ( hand disinfectant ) are the ones who are perfumed .
There are disinfectants with textures , wine grape and orange scents that are very appealing to children .
Hands disinfectant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
Especially for young children just a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning .
`` It is highly concentrated alcohol , '' Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the poison emergency center in the hospital of the University of Kansas , told the broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City .
So you would leave around a SIP of whisky , but people let this hand disinfectant to come within reach of children , and if children , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six year girl that had recently taken four splashes of strawberry scented hand disinfectants in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
Your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is regarded as a drunk at an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency room doctor who treated them at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
Nhaijah lallte her words and was not in a position to go , when she arrived in the emergency room .
Doctors monitored overnight they had met with signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and the head in a separate children 's hospital , Ritchey said .
`` It was very scary , '' said Scott Ortoria Nhaijahs mother , CNN .
It would be fatal to my child .
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers to use soft products or disinfectant wipes and hand disinfectants to keep out of the reach of children .
In addition to alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants were associated with deaths .
In 2013 , two women in Ontario women died after swallowing of hand disinfectants , which contained a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
Employees of health officials suspect that the product contained methanol , a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol , which was listed as an ingredient .
In January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York , planned to poison their `` nasty '' teacher , by claiming antibacterial products around the classroom , `` as it reports a police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banned them from their space .
The police saw the failed plan as `` chatter '' and disciplinary action referred to the school authority .

Metcash starts Bodenständigkeits campaign to fight Aldi- incursion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an ALDI march in South Australia and Western Australia .
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a Bodenständigkeits campaign to defend the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in a $ 700 million - ALDI - invasion .
While although prepared for the opening of the first 120 stores and two distribution centres in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets to strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build on the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media just about events such as Adelaide 's show .
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as find Simmo DUNS borough distributed in IGA stores samples and shopkeepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian Fußballliga to loyal customers .
It is expected that if the wholesaler for food , alcohol and devices holds its annual investor Strategietag Metcash released more details of its defence strategy on September 29 .
There is a lot at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA shops and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs Oststaaten IGA network .
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Oststaaten .
However , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that ALDI is twelve months after opening its first markets around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states each time and will take away all the existing players , but mainly independent retailers sales .
According to a report published in this week , the Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that $ 360 million in sales per year and Metcash IGA retailers could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
This prediction is based on the assumption that although next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in Wa and achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss in food and grocery store and the amounts based on Metcashs high fixed costs Metcash could cost around $ 13 million of earnings before interest and taxes , Mr Kierath said .
At the same time , Metcash is losing market share in the Oststaaten , mainly at ALDI and Coles , although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found out that IGA - buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley assumes Metcashs sales in food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , will fall by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund manager told Douglass , founder of Magellan Financial Group , at a business lunch in Melbourne today that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade , Metcash .
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Douglass .
But it is believed that a member of Metcash has been in contact with Mr Douglass last week .
IGAs market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Metcashs food and grocery retailer , which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operational debt reduction while putting pressure on sales and margins .
However , the wholesaler refuses and investing more than $ 150 million to improve sale prices align with Cole 's and the region for centuries in hundreds of products every week and IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label foods .
Metcashs chief executive officer Ian D. Ferrin , and D. Morrice says that the price adjustments and store refurbishment programmes will lay in Elan and hopes that the wholesaler in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .

Peter Moody claimed that stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the racing
Peter Moody claimed that Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to quit the race immediately .
It was aimed at the stewards and the Integritäts Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they held a personal campaign against him for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday , with the late scratching of Lady Tatai .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing and he had found himself under difficult conditions , when it came to the cobalt positive swab test at Lidaris he can not explain .
He had withheld 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want it `` look like at high hanging grapes . ''
`` I had nothing to say about it , and I 've been sitting on this for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , '' Moody said .
They know that it went further .
Sometimes it reacts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that , what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to go around with my head held high , and I would like to think that my owner that I try my best for them .
If you start to think that I am not doing that , then I should no longer be the coach .
I have to consider , then , what I do with my license .
Moody had previously let the bomb in an interview with racing.com high that Integritäts department had tried to spy on his stall .
`` Eighteen months ago , Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man , whom I shall name , if I am asked , and offered him a job in my stables , in order to provide information about what I do in my stables , '' Moody said on Racing .
They obviously believe that I am a fraudster .
If this is the case , you should certainly take on their noses because they have failed in a bid to catch me .
Robert Roulston , former chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , Acting President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of RVL , were aware of it at the time , and there are still today .
Should bring me to the view that it personally ?
Has the RVL cowardly behaviour , and makes people outside of trainers may be responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I so bad for the industry ?
Perhaps people think out there that I am .
They may have to take my license and offend me , and I have no doubt that what I say will consider it now .
But I 'm now at the point where I think the matter is , and that makes me sad .
This makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
Frustrations levels of trainers have built up with the prolonged cobalt investigation in Lidari , and the late scratching meant that he said that he `` could take his license on the table . ''
Moody , best known for its preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar , described the race day treatment rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the legs of horses , which was against the rules .
`` It is against the rules of racing .
I must take full responsibility for that , `` he said .
`` One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg .
It would be so last night .
It would have been able to be so throughout the day yesterday , which was also so .
It was however on the day of the race .
Moody could be faced with a three month disqualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race , has opened an investigation into this matter .
It is a joke .
People who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
`` We all recognise that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , '' Moody said .

Brazil 's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes healthy breastfeeding diet
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS tried , in a shocking way , educate women about how important good nutrition is during the silent era , it does so with the presentation of images of babies sucking on breasts , which are painted with images of unhealthy foods .
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
Due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
However , new research suggests that a higher caloric intake is not the only dietary adjustment , should make the mothers .
Under the direction of Robert Waterland , a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , a recent study showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies , and protects them from the development of tumours .
Unfortunately , an unhealthy diet can adversely affect the immune system of the child .

'Genetics ' brain cells can control by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment , in which they are irradiated with sound pulses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves .
The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses , which have high frequencies to the human ear , in order to be heard .
The stimulus work through the activation of motor neuron cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves .
Further on this subject : Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure , called sono Genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses in the brain of people for the treatment of the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Thread worms are usually not on ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles .
The bubbles , he was found to increase the ultrasonic waves , which then invade the worms .
The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures that are called TRP - 4 Ion channels and cells are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
The sound waves cause the opening up of these Ion channels and activating the cells to which they are assigned , according to a report in Nature Communications .
In order to create ultrasound controlled nematodes , Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that bear some of their motor neurons TRP - 4 Ion channels .
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are amplified by the micro bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the change in motor neurons .
The procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists , neurons with pulses of light on and off .
But Chalasani said that sono Genetics could have some advantages to this technique .
In contrast to light that needs to be revealed to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain tissue low frequency ultrasonic waves can happen without hindrance and can then be sent to the brain from the top of the skull .
`` We believe that it is possible to make the human neurons have been temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , '' Chalasani said .
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

No problem for the yuan .
Snakes fascinate and frighten people .
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
`` The animals are part of our family , '' said Stephanie 's mother , Brigitte Probst .
Abuse in the attitude of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Stephanie Probst also takes this position : `` It is not good for our animals , it is also not good for us . ''
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each canvas of pranks .
The `` four legged artists , '' as they are affectionately called , is to read each desire of the eyes .
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them .

The two animals have lived in an enclosure together for eight years and nothing has happened .
`` But then , suddenly , there was our small Jumbo , '' says Brigitte Probst .
The Zebroid is still not ready for the riding school , it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst , however .
For every visitor should therefore be something .
`` One thing is for sure , '' says Stephanie Probst : `` Whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and do it with all my heart . ''
The Circus Probst invites at 17 and 20 from 17 to 20 September on a daily basis to his ideas .
On Sunday , the program begins at 11 and 16 : 00 .
Thursday is uneven , prices are reduced for the presentation at 17 : 00 .

Anyone who eats the fruit thus supports vision , immune and metabolic processes in the body .
When you buy mangoes should not be too soft or too hard and pleasant smell .
The skin color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is , so can also green mangoes taste very delicious .
They should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days .
Then they taste , of course , pure or in sweet dishes .
But a mango is also hearty dishes a special touch .
It softens the bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chicoree and Radiccio .
And a Mangochutney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and the view of the Australian tennis federation president Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly referred to as `` Special KS '' came into the spotlight by the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters .
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter , Kokkinakis and his opponent , Ryan Harrison , twice had to be separated by the referee , and Harrison said : `` Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios , and I should beat the child . ''
While he was last seen , as he was a tennis racquet after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual artist behind Bernard against Great Britain in the Davis Cup semifinals .
`` One thing that I am pretty ereifere is the fact that , in my view , a little Thanasi was drawn into the dispute , '' Healy said .
He has broken a racquet when he lost in the US Open because of a Krampfes , but he is not the first player who has broken a racquet in frustration with himself , and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , really , he has behaved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
He has a great team around them , he has a great family around them , and I believe that he was treated a little too tightly .
He is a very mature 19 years , he works very hard , and he fits into the team , and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in the dressing area , he trains hard , he is in good shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits .
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important qualifiers , which begins on Friday , and he describes the `` joint decision '' as the right one for everyone , but he assures the man from Canberra to return , as a long term is an integral part of the team. ``
`` First of all , we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not at all the controversy around [ Kyrgios ] , '' Healy said .
And I think that Nick has managed to rise very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , he is rising in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we are trying to support him , we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions . Some time outside of the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .

EU wants to double mercury limit in Raubfischen
The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and expect consumers to a much higher dose of nerve gifts .
The consumer organisation Food Watch before an appropriate working paper the EU sharply criticized the plans : `` The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy will be passed on to pregnant women and infants with full force , '' said Matthias Wolfschmidt Foodwatch .
According to Wolf Schmidt , the limits of the nerve poison for big fish at the end of the food chain such as swordfish or Hai- for `` economic reasons '' are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
Large predatory fish are already so contaminated with mercury , however , that can not be sold on the basis of the current limits of about 50 percent of the catch .
After doubling the limit only 14.5 % would become unsaleable .
In return for the easing the EU according to Food Watch wants to tighten limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
Food Watch described it as a `` trick '' because smaller peaceful fish such as carp are usually charged so low that they already comply with the planned levels .
The reduction in small fish is `` a perfides diversionary tactic , that alone will help the economy , '' Wolf Schmidt explained .
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for the people that greatly enriching themselves through the food chain , especially in predatory fish .
The Federal Government warns that that `` even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system , '' especially in unborn .
The Environment explains on its website in relation to the current levels , however , that a `` health risk to the general population '' is not to be expected .
Mercury gets into the environment by coal combustion .
The German coal plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year , according to a written information of the German Federal Ministry for Environment of the Greens - federal MPs Annalena Baer Bock , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
The concentration of mercury in fish , for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube is `` permanent and nationwide , '' the `` mirror '' in March was quoted in the paper .
Last year included warnings about mercury in fish is already among the most common reported health risks in the EU RASFF alert system throughout Europe .

Konrad in search of 35,000 winter solid quarters
Konrad has their hands full with the refugee accommodation .
Christian Konrad , it is usual that his word has weight .
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen bankers set up headquarters for the thousands of refugees .
The chaos of the reception centre Traiskirchen , Konrad has already to get a grip on the situation .
`` We have no more homeless in Traiskirchen , '' he said of his first success .
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , is also without a big fuss , said Konrad and praised the organizational `` masterpiece . ''
The Home Office said instead of a `` crisis situation . ''
Overall , Konrad expects with a demand of 85,000 quarters this year .
In order to meet the number must be found in the next few weeks still 35,000 accommodations - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
If there are more refugees , we can create it .
`` But it is not a bottomless pit , '' Konrad said .
Captains with the country he has already held talks .
They had assured him that even for the refugees to come to create districts .
`` In Upper Austria , it is good , '' said Ferry Maier .
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad .
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn , it should be clarified how the church will help .
Great expectations as we help the asylum coordinator in the ORF action '. ``
On the platform , individuals can offer simple accommodation .
Moreover , one hopes on hotels that are empty in the winter .
Konrad and Maier criticised the standards for the accommodation as `` very high '' yesterday .
In times of need , it can not be that service provider must comply with a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the overhead lights .
`` Emergency '' ARDS should apply for a temporary period of time .
That , in contrast to the Home Office , he was successful in terms of accommodation , establishes Konrad with his experience .
I am an elderly gentleman , you can not simply say in the face of the untruth .
Persuasion is his main weapon .
Konrad and Maier cause no cost of the Republic , as she herself said .
Their number of employees want to increase it to three or four .
The district search has so far not been successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container by inmates as an office .
But there are obvious problems with the approval .
Linz is calling for a better division
For the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and the Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
This is not necessary at the moment , since it could accommodate the affected at the moment without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Luger ( SP ) .
In the event of an emergency , but further sites will be checked for their suitability .
Criticism of the city head to the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
Other districts also need to contribute here .

For slightly overweight diabetics weight loss surgery can be helpful .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years , according to a new study .
It is still too early to say whether , after the weight loss surgery , slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer than those who received non surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data will need a long time to show something , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert in the weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in Jama Surgery .
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
Over the years , obesity surgery have been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted on people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to height , is between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal .
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , the researchers used data from Taiwan 's Min Sheng General Hospital since 2007 , they have collected in a study and compare these two types of obesity surgery , gastric bypass and gastric tube education , medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those who are subjected to this operation , fell from 31 to 24.5 in this study by the end of the fifth year .
Meanwhile , the BMI in those who received no surgical diabetes treatments remained roughly equal in 29
Among those who are subjected to a surgical operation , triggered the diabetes disease completely and some at 28 % to 36 % .
In the medically treated group was fully in just one percent in the comparison of diabetes and , in part , with only about two percent .
In addition , the results were generally better at the controls blood pressure , triglycerides and `` bad '' LDL cholesterol `` in the surgery group , '' the authors found .
The researchers monitored the patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
After the surgery , the average hemoglobin A1c level by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 % .
But this better `` glycemic control '' - as is reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - not reduced the mortality rate in five years , as the Chief researcher Dr. Chih Cheng HSU and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results from the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , achieved greater reductions in BMI ( 7.4 to 5.1 ) and hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a more complete elimination of diabetes ( 46,9 % vs. 16.7 % ) .
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Blackstone , of the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix .
In the Swedish study , it was in obese people , who have undergone obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried konventionellere methods .
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients , Blackstone said , it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process .
`` This is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , '' no increased risk of death or a kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start weight is seriously , as soon as the patient with a BMI between 27 and 30 .
`` I think that we have to wait until we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that their bodies have strongly linked with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really hard. ``

Election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's halved ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against it .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 % previously ) , while Sanders is in second place , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries .
More than five months before the start of the primaries , most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinions , it is clear which candidate they will support .
But Clinton 's supporters are more consistent than the other candidates in the election .
Since the CBS News poll , Clinton has lost on a number of demographic groups , while Sanders achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates , but these protrusions have reduced .
Their support among men has fallen significantly , and Sanders is here only by 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now at the same level .
Clinton still has a large lead among older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double digit lead over the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
About half of the Democratic primary voters across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party .
A quarter would support it with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support it because she is the candidate .
Six percent would not support it .
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton 's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support it .
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
If Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want that she is the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton 's supporters are also mentioned her relationship with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
Support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited .
As the Vice President raises a potential for the presidency in the balance , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
If Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Biden is at the top .
More than half of Clinton 's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice well before Sanders .
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton 's lead before Sanders , will increase by 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
55 % of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month .
Biden is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the `` most eligible '' has risen .
However , on the question of what is important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions of eligibility .
Similar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is the primaries as unacceptable .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in a number of important characteristics in their party 's primary voters .
Majorities see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty , while Clinton 's strength is the lead .
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say this about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic primary voters see Clinton , Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views in general .
In all of these measurements , about a quarter of Democratic voters has no opinion of Sanders .
As questions about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal email address and server during the term as Secretary of State continues to be asked , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole .
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
Half of Americans is now unhappy with its statement , while only about a third is satisfied .
Public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
Most Americans have said that the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , while 36 percent said that their opinion of her is even worse .
There are mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them as a whole : Only 32 percent among registered voters see her as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of eligible voters do not regard it as an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy .
Clinton and Trump will get good marks for leadership , however .
Of the six tested candidates Biden , Carson and Bush cut best with honesty .
A majority sees Sanders is more likely to be honest , but as with Carson , many have no opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .

Di Maria is , in order to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates after his match against Malmö with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani .
Di Maria is in his debut in the Champions League in Malmö on Tuesday and help PSG pull over .
Here are the game report and the response to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course , when Paris Saint Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 - 0 victory against Malmö at Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday .
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champions on the road , but then they missed a number of opportunities , before they finally increased their lead when Cavani a Kopfballtor scored in the 61st minute .
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions , as they not only want the qualification for the K.O.-Runden , but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of goal . He was replaced later in the game against his hometown team , and against the club with which he began his illustrious career back in 1999 .
`` It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League , so it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents and relaxed look back , even if there are certain things that in the course of the season , we have yet to perfect , '' said Blanc .
`` This is a good omen .
We wanted to win and we have won , although I regret that we have not yet reached one or two more goals. ``
Manuel returned in one of three changes in the Paris team after his injury , which could keep a 2 : 2 draw against Bordeaux on home ground in the league at the weekend , but he has been surpassed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
The Argentine striker has been described as the man , the PSG can take to the next level in Europe , when it was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he hinted at why , when he ran into Marco Verrattis pass behind the defence in Malmö , before he graduated nicely in the corner of the net past Johan Wiland .
However , if someone believed that PSG would make a great victory , was disappointed .
Malmö , which beat Celtic in a play off , in order to reach this stage , came with nine national players on the field at Anpiff and strung with a five man defence and two deep in the midfield was a serious opponent .
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic went far past Kevin Music posts in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PSG patzte even sometimes , with some bad passes and bad accounts , not least by Inter , with no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart .
However , he showed much more skill , which was directed by Wiland past the post in the 52nd minute , when he brought his players into the game , and it was a pass from Manuel Di Maria turned into a spin shot ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani . The pampero scored his sixth Saisontor after Inter had got a left flank of Maxwell .
That ended any thought that Malmö could come back into the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz , the end result could keep low , before substitute players was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end .
The trainer of Malmö , Age Hareide , announced later that PSG played a class on his team , and the Norwegians said : `` Our last Champions League game was in December last year .
Since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level .
The qualifying games are not enough. ``
Hats off to Paris. ``
It was a great game from them .

At the same time , Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q stores nationwide
By Rupert Steiner , City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British put down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you can deal with a hammer or a brush to the painting of walls , you are now seems to have become a minority .
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out central jobs in their homes , as the boss of the company behind B & Q .
Véronique Laury , new managing director of Kingfisher , which owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at budget prices is now obsolete .
Therefore , Kingfisher plans to open 200 more northern shops , directed at craftsmen and to close 60 stores of B & Q .
Mrs. Laury said that it wants to employ more women in B & Q stores , because eight out of ten purchases in the store are made by women .
At the moment , outweigh the men on the staff .
They said it was necessary to confront the growing demographic trends , which have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past .
Mrs. Laury said : `` There is still a majority of men in our stores .
We need to move it more towards a balance .
Basically half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
Women play a major role in the decision making process .
Mrs. Laury , who is one of only five women at the head of one of Britain 's leading companies listed in the FTSE100 index has also umstruktiert her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in management positions .
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team filled with women , including its CEO and CFO .
Mrs. Laury said : `` This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
It was not difficult to find good women to our Board .
Kingfisher announced a drop in half year profit and sales , after the group had trained the costs of closing the stores .
Because of the trend , Kingfisher , which owns B & Q and northern , 200 open new branches .

Croatia : `` We let the refugees through ''
`` Now the border controls will also ramped on our southern border , '' said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl Leitner .
The controls on the Hungarian border remain upright at the same time .
Still , it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application could also make that 'of course ' .
The care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
Is also clear , `` that it needs clear signals , '' the minister said .
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not even on the Austrian - Slovenian border .
It needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is denied `` corridor '' - Slovenia
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to allow incoming refugees to travel further in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also create corridors for the refugees .
Just saw that Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana , however , do not .
The idea of corridors is `` absolutely unacceptable , '' Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - .
The border with Croatia is an external border of the Schengen area , on the other hand , already heavily controlled .
As the Minister pointed out , Slovenia will not seal its borders for refugees .
`` Each EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system may not work , '' Györkös Znidar noted .
As the Croatian government announced , had the first refugees already in the night hours on Tuesday tried to enter the border in Eastern past Tovarnik / Sid , in order to evade the registration .
The Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
According to local media since the Croatian Tovarnik constantly police vehicles with new refugees .
It was mainly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
Emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
In the next few days count his country with around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ranko politics .
In addition , buses from Presevo on the Macedonian - Serbian border , which had hitherto brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would be diverted towards Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday in Beijing .
The government in Belgrade anweise denied , however , that it is the people to embark on certain routes : `` Neither we , nor do we want to do this , '' it said .
According to media reports is in any case a first bus in the morning with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid , more buses are expected over the course of the day .
On Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling all night from the Macedonian border , about 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
`` We have heard that Hungary has closed down , so the police has said that we should go here , '' said one of the refugees .
They wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
This could actually come to the postponement of the Balkan route to date already predicted by observers of Turkey - Greece - Macedonia - Serbia - Hungary on a track located to the west .
Croatia : `` Extensive opportunities for border control ''
Politics of Croatia 's interior minister had previously stressed that his country was prepared for possible emergency situations appropriate plans in the event of a strong influx of refugees .
Details he was not , he however pointed out that Croatia as non Schengen members have extensive opportunities for border control .
We have strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia is a good testimony that since 2007 , the EU partners represent the country consistently since then , as regards the standard of border controls .
On the Serb side are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence to about 300 refugees .
According to Belgrade media reports she had spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke .
According to the Hungarian authorities remain the two crossings Horgos and Backi gradually continue to be completely blocked .
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , is still unclear .
The Serbian Interior Minister Nelise Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local sight in Horgos : It seems the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , to be premature .
Currently , it would not be very high numbers of refugees .
It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
Helper rates to migrants - and dangerous - alternative routes
However , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees , on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia .
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia , however , is not without risk : In some parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia has still not cleared minefields .
On Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern has been sent to the border region .

The name change was requested by the Association of Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens - Martin Kruse , pastor of the Town - Lutheran community in Rome , reminded Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes for centuries as a minority often only able to live their faith in secret .
The space will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 1483 - 1546 ) as a young Augustinian monk held around the New Year in Rome in 1510 / 11 a few months .
He felt the city at that time as verkommenes sins of Babel .
His negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome in the view of historians .
Luther had then introduced the division of the Western church with his theses against the selling of indulgences .

Europe 's refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closing the border , holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and gave everyone who tried to come into the country illegally , all with the aim to stop the influx of migrants .
Chaos followed as hundreds of migrants in a no man 's land on the border ansammelten and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
The people who had fled from violence , stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries for an unknown period of time and built tents and settled down there .
But frustrations rose .
As a police helicopter hovered over them , the migrants `` open the border ! '' Chanted and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police .
Some were back in protest of food and water .
Serbia 's foreign minister said it was `` unacceptable '' that migrants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) will be part of the solution and not a collateral damage .
It must be held talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , `` said Ivica Dacic in Prague .
The turmoil at the Hungarian / Serbian border came one day after the bloc of 28 nations could not agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
The ministers , however , agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece überrumpelten . They expressed their hope that , in the next month or until the end of the year , finally reached an agreement that the EU countries would accept another 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary , .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent .
Hungary continued , however , his hopes for a speedy action by Brussels or by its neighbors .
A state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , so that they could hammer roads and speed up asylum procedures .
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said , meanwhile , that his country also plan the construction of a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania , in order to stop the influx of migrants from the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
In recent months , Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a major bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union .
However , Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that the most purchased are economic migrants who are in search of a better life , and not war refugees , have the right to protection - a view that is sharply at odds with other EU countries , including Germany , .
The new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing the border or the damage of 4 meters ( 13 feet ) high fence , the government built along the southern border with Serbia , a crime . These laws are also higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers .
`` Due to the situation that has arisen as a result of the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand , '' government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
We say it very clearly : Illegal crossing is a crime .
Parliament must still agree with procedural or the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but reporters from the Associated Press , heavily armed soldiers at the border with vehicles and dogs have already seen for days .
Gyorgy Bakondi , national security adviser for Orban , said that authorities erwischten 45 people in an attempt to cross the border , 15 others were already penetrated deeper into the country .
They come across , they damage the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of committing offences under the new laws .
Authorities are in the process of quickly to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a Zugwaggon with barbed wire to close the borders , arrived on Tuesday morning .
Confusion surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , as the Hungarians hineinzudrängen opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and put a crowd there .
About 20 managed to get inside , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .

Jewellery instead of curtain - `` head as a fashion niche
Before it went to the long stick machines in and around Plauen , to make metres .
The embroidered fabrics and lace were further processed in large quantities for customers such as blankets and curtains .
That alone no longer works , explains Andreas Reinhardt , CEO of Plauen fashion tip .
Instead , the fashion is important again .
In the early days of the `` top fashion played a major role , was then replaced by the domestic textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt cites some examples : Head in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
At Stanford University , called the vintage fashion , much of past eras , an increasing order potential .
Anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
With us , they already account for half of all orders .
Fashion tip Plauen lace and embroidery is a member along with nine other companies in the industry association. ``
Only they can bear the protected label .
In the last 15 years has about 80 percent of sales .
Private shops and wholesale , there is almost no more .
Our products reach the customer in this way hardly .
The mass manufactured goods will be much cheaper in Asia today and sold almost exclusively on chains .
Also , the export schwächle , currently in Russia and in the United States .
So enough reasons for new ways .
The industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness as Cordula Bauer of the stick pearl in Falkenstein explains : `` Since this year we produce a quality seal , which shows that we are ecologically and socially acceptable . ''
Reinhardt added : `` It also refers to the materials used . ''
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches Berger in the snow of Westsächsischen Hochschule Zwickau , at the Faculty of Applied Arts , and specializes in embroidery and lace .
Find high quality and innovative products to counter the competition from the Asian region .
This takes time and courage .
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the businesses in particular need to think economically , `` Schmidt said .
Therefore , an existing design will often vary only slightly in order to keep a customer base .
A few years ago revived the historic pyramid top textile designer Kati Reuter .
The machine uses small beads in some places .
The `` gold champion Bianca Hallebach Krauße could inspire them : '' Before I could not start with traditional `` top . ''
Now she uses the pyramid tip for her jewelry .
In an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
`` Many people in the region identify with the subject '' tip - young and old , `` Reuter said .
It also supplies in the United States , Australia and Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento .

At its most anticipated meeting in years Fed strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 foot Honduras mahogany table in order to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in almost a decade .
Disrespectful about them at one end of the ornate , two storey sitting room is a mural of the United States .
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues will put the economic interests of the nation above all other things .
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : Maximizing the US employment and keep prices stable here .
But since the Great Recession , the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate : Financial stability .
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it . It will start on Thursday announced that the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate near zero since late 2008 .
Although most of the economic data show that it is solid , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials anxious to strengthen this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal debt - and it is only about a quarter percentage point .
`` Obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important in the first place , what they watch , '' said Lindsey M. Piegza , Chefökonomin Maklerfirma Bodies Nicolaus & Co .
`` But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate , the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , '' she said .
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do , which confuses the financial market in itself .
About half of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently have predicted a rate hike this week .
Financial markets expect the Fed waiting , however , with a key indicator that displays only a 30 % chance of an increase .
This points to a decline in the stock market , if the Fed increases the sentence , unless the strategists to soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
On Tuesday 16.599,85 jumped on the Dow Jones Industrial Durchschnittswert 228,89 points or 1.4 % .
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy upholds the sentence this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time , `` he said .
If you do it , `` they would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets , so that they do not panic . ''
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
As recently as a month ago , the Fed seemed well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States .
In spring and early summer , Yellen had said that this year they expect despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed , an increase in the rate .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labour market this year was solid .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and in the vicinity of the level the Fed considers full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And even though inflation was consistently below the central bank 's 2 % annual target , the Fed 's representative said that the main reason was the temporary impact of sharply lower oil prices .
The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , `` said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon macroeconomics .
But the financial markets around the world had zuckten late last month , after China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones Industrial Durchschnittswert fell by more than 16 % below its peak in May , as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth .
The market has recovered somewhat in this month , while the Dow is now at almost 10 % below the peak in May .
For the Fed 's representatives should influence the market turmoil the complex calculation when you increase the interest rate .
`` If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred , they would attract the reins in this session , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve .
Now says he predicted that they would wait at least a month to get to grips with the impact better .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , '' said Oliner .
The health of the global economy is none of the Fed 's main concern , so technically they should not be involved in their decision making .
But in the end , the Fed has become the world 's monetary authority .
The influence of the central bank was enormously in the last few years .
The mere hint of the former leader could `` narrow '' Ben S. Bernanke that the Fed 's monetary expansion in 2013 , triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , can be expected from the Fed representatives that they not only monitor the developments in other places , but also with other central banks , experts advise , in order to get a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision is `` more art than science , '' said Zachary Karabell , head of global strategy for the company 's asset management Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , va. , said this month that `` the Fed has a history of excessive reactions to market movements , which are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals . ''
Lacker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to a rate hike , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions `` despite limited visible impact on growth in the US , '' Lacker said .
A year later , the Fed representatives made these cuts .
The Fed should set only during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse in the first place aspects of financial stability , said Adam S. Posen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England to set interest rates .
The recent turmoil do not come near this level , he said .
`` It is certainly not in the situation where they fear a rise in interest rates , because the markets are upset , '' said Posen , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that they should rush ahead of time .

Foreigners also have their Corbyn 's and Nigel Farage 's .
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states , it is so deeply enmeshed in various crises , such as the EU , and not always from their own fault , Britain 's own agendas are saturated with divided concessions and disruptive changes , which they usually do not want to .
In Brighton , the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it may be , if they threaten the social protection .
We could also call Dave and Georges Selfie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reform .
It is always about me .
My European friend who wants an outside view of Britain inside the EU tent - `` Let us not only in France , '' says Berlin - and you can look through that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some cities have come to the point where it is no matter to them , whether we stay or go .
Germany 's cautious prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , as it happened in the overly long help arrested as Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Kohl and Mitterrand ( 14 ) ( 16 ) .
France 's François Hollande looks back on his reelection or his replacement in 2017 .
He is also a declining force .
Poland may soon be a left a right nationalist government , Spain .
It is hard to imagine that they will plug a leg to help the Selfie Britons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland 's exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
Therefore may be planning some sort of minister even suspected of deliberately not helpful comments , quite the SNP style , while Britain 's referendum campaign in 2017 , in order to speed up the process of Brexit , my friend .
`` The renegotiation was a bust , '' and `` Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation . ''
The Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics is the oligarchy of the press barons , as they were during the referendum in 1975 but not inspired by Tony Benn , that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson , the ore - euro opportunists , who has made a name for himself as an `` EU straight bananas '' Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s .
For all its craziness , Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
This was part of the medley of tax - pseudo non - nationals and foreigners who own most of our major newspapers to describe - rogue , phone hack .
Tony Blair really thought much about it , but found that if one is sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla , you better distributed bananas to distract him , rather than to be his lunch and dinner .
In fact , Miliband was Blairianer more than Blair himself , when he opposed to Cameron 's referendum Eddy , because Blair had not adopted the principle of the EU constitution , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door to him .
The press has never forgiven him as well .
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave me a friendly slap on the back in Westminster on Monday , and I told him that he needed to waste no more time for me - seems in danger of Neil Kinnock 's boycott Murdoch strategy to repeat the 80 's , a mistake then and now .
It may take time , but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Detroit , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyn 's official position on Europe is - I am sometimes kind - in the development .
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
Well , most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye trend and the more wild climes of skeptics Klein Engländerismus everyone can say yes .
It is what `` A Benn , not a Bennite '' Hilary Benn said on the radio and on television this week , as the scouts fought in it , not to admit that Corbyn 's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 1970s , when his old father on television that tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without having to go too far and lose his cabinet job .
Hilarys fight was even more attractive .
But to fight to remain `` under all circumstances '' - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said , nor what JC and his colleagues told MPs after all the reports on its closing session on Monday evening .
Whatever the sentimental nature wants to give bottom - up image of Corbyn - remember that he has even touched me - news - discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all , in the vortex of social media , a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe , which allowed him to keep Labour 's support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyn 's fundamental ambiguity to EU membership , in accordance with its Bennite Belagerungs economy , anti - capitalist past , is no longer a question of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents , is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes to the narcissism of small differences .
As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC launches a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in particular .
If all of this can be useless , why should waste political capital of Paris or Berlin - they have also distrustful voters - in order to make concessions to the British ?
The US is already pretty disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction of the Tory government in power , which at the start on Monday , I was reminded of something called British Influence Security Forum .

Experts criticise report by Public Health England on electronic cigarettes
Claims of a publicly funded agency that electronic cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with ties to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , joined The Lancet , by they criticise the evidence used by Public Health England ( PHE ) in its report on electronic cigarettes .
PHE , the `` principle '' report published last month and describes him as a `` comprehensive review of the evidence . ''
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and highlighted the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the `` extremely windy basis , '' based on the PHE 's most important conclusion .
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the allegations `` built on sand or stone . ''
Martin McKee , professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell , professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . ''
They said that the public expects that PHE 's assertion that `` the current best estimate is that electronic cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking , '' based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling .
In fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened in order to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis ( MCDA ) Multi Criteria Decision Analysis - in order to have their opinions about the damage a synthesis of a number of products containing nicotine ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Cape said that is a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health , whose directors have previously received from British American Tobacco ( BAT ) means for an independent study .
He also signed the BAT references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said to receive funds from an electronic cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding , which he joined after reports were received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International , she added .
The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel will not be delivered , but it includes several popular electronic cigarette champions , some of whom also indicate an industry funding in the paper .
Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
At the meeting was also attended by the tobacco control of PHE .
The group 's research `` tellingly admits '' that there is a lack of `` hard evidence for the harms of most products on most criteria , '' wrote McKee and Cape well .
However , none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report will be discussed .
McKee and Cape said that the allegations of PHE , that `` there is no evidence so far that e - cigarettes serve as a way for smoking for children or non smokers were '' premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and wellbeing at PHE , said that has already responded to the allegations by BMJ .
He said : `` Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . ''
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his addiction .
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are small in comparison , but that we have to continue to study the long term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking , and smoking , the national health system costs £2 billion per year .
Through the clear proof of current evidence that electronic cigarettes are not without risk , but represent only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking , we meet our national responsibility .

8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is seriously .
Some have tried to brand him as a flop .
Others have dismissed it as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But no matter , as some Republicans are trying to draw from the upper echelons in polls down Donald Trump , it did not work ( yet ) .
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed in double digits , and some are beginning to ask themselves seriously , what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul Donald Trump .
Of course , it is still too early in the term .
No one is claiming that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 , Rick Perry 's leadership has been handed over to the rising Herman Cain , none of which have also won only one state in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth now see Trump 's stamina and begin to get their dollars flow in order to overthrow him .
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase .
Trump 's popularity ratings have shot up to 180 degrees .
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in June , a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul in a positive way .
By the middle of July , it was 40 percent .
At the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
Now , six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
About three in ten say that they have a negative opinion .
And these figures are in early states .
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump .
Two thirds of the GOP - GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate .
Last week , in a poll by CNN / ORC , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either `` enthusiastic '' or `` pleased '' if Trump were nominated .
Only two out of 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the nominee .
Only Ben Carson creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they would be `` thrilled '' vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump ) .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
On the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be `` dissatisfied '' or `` angry '' if Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
A majority of Republicans , Trump 's temperament is not a problem .
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombastic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters inclined to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul had the right temperament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
The same number applies in the first primary state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a leader , according to Quinnipiac last week .
Still , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament is not passe to the White House , ABC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
If your scholar hats , Republican voters think Trump is real .
If you are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , four out of ten from the past week after a survey by CNN / ORC say that Trump is the best bet .
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP voters had not the clearest crystal ball in the past .
At this time last cycle , four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination , compared with only 28 % of the final candidate , Mitt Romney .
However , shows that a large number of GOP voters see Trump 's campaign as plausible .
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate , Trump is still almost every .
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely contributes to Trump 's leadership during the anti - Trump Support diffusely distributed on more than a dozen other candidates .
A Monmouth University poll in early September , however , shows that harvests the majority support in a hypothetical head to head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates , Trump .
He has 33 points against Carly Fiorina 13 point lead , 14 points , 15 points ahead of Walker , 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio , Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie .
It is a head to head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head to head race .
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans says that they have formed their opinion .
A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump , say that they have found their voices .
Of course , a lot can happen in order to change this , and no one can really say , never to change their minds .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
Still , Trump 's strongest competition at the moment of other outsiders , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as often for Trump .
Six in 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration .
Ever since Donald Trump called `` rapists '' in his campaign speech to two months of immigrants from Mexico , immigration was the lynchpin in the public discourse to 2016 .
Some are concerned that Trump 's bombastic language will keep crucial Hispanic Americans from the Republican Party and will damage the Neuorientierungs efforts .
But after the new ABC / Post poll on Monday , six in 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
As long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it is apparently also do Donald Trump .
The frustration over the government climbs to new highs .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson is now about half of support from Republican voters , especially by their outsider status .
Six in 10 Republicans say in the new Monday - ABC / Post poll , they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience .
And they are also angry at Washington .
A survey by Bloomberg / Des Moines Register in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans on the Republicans in Congress are frustrated , exasperated with 54 percent `` dissatisfied '' and 21 percent `` same vein . ''

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere , that it was only in September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England , and given his history , his participation in next summer at the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had found the last season had finished strong after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing back during the early season .
`` This type of injury threatened not to pursue a career , '' said Wenger .
It is a bone that has not healed well .
This is not a major issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before .
That may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wenger also acknowledged , there is the risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
It also develops an unpleasant pattern .
The study by Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago .
He also played in just 65 of arsenal 157 league games in the last five seasons .
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs who have recorded the most violation days in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury during the last season will continue .
`` Sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat force , '' Wenger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body is stabilised , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday , and Wenger is a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not travelled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start .
Wenger can also start with Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs and Theo Walcott .
`` I try to keep the balance and the players that we need to take a little breather , '' Wenger said .
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress from Group F , the kebabs stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds in Europe with the biggest intimidation effect .
Dynamo is also after 41 games unbeaten after the `` invincible '' campaign has been launched in the last season .
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , and 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale .
This year , it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learnt the lesson of the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope , with his management to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '' said Wenger .
It has never worked at Arsenal .
In 2006 we were very close , but on the other hand , I am long enough in the business , in order to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not a dreamer .

Surely David Cameron knows better The Lorax ?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn : If your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost by heart .
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems , to name his favorite children 's book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax , published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. Seuss .
It was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company super camp , and continues : `` Funny , moving , and creative with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far . ''
All well and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead reflect a summary of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and details to expand the rather short text .
`` In the midst of the walled city of Thneed - Ville , where all of nature is gone , and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams , he fulfilled their desire to see a real tree , '' reads one , a love interest , however , Dr. Seuss , whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage , who died in 1991 , was completely unknown .
As if that were not suspicious enough , the text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax movie , which will be presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and so begins : `` In the walled city of Thneed - Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams . ''
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . Here is an unnamed boy Lorax Thneed rope ends once - ler , as the local environment by the greedy , trees be cases , despite the protests of the name give a Hock schnurrbärtigen nature , `` it speaks on behalf of the trees , '' is devastated .
Most likely , such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper , of The Lorax 20 times in a row has not read to a child .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron 's constituency office .
Super camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron 's staff , but gave no further immediate comment .

Eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
Eleven years ago , I moved as even forgotten 19 year old in a student residence , which is still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the strained smile of those who I have annoyed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned , can be distilled into eight simple rules .
The collection in student residences ranges from slightly fraught to absolutely terrifying .
It is tempting to bleat : Tell people where you are coming from , whether and where you 've taken sabbatical where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you HAHAHA `` frankly Marmite neither love nor hate , because seriously , guys , it 's just a yeast extract , I 'm in my room . ''
Breathe through .
And help others to do the same - Set questions and show interest .
It draws the conversation and helps you to find the people who you are in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyelashes were on fire and the fire extinguisher .
Let people .
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions , movie night venues and local venues , but they are also the places where people dress and her underwear right back .
Related to this : Remember not to start at the university with a relationship
Introvertierte get a rough treatment at the university .
Your room should be a refuge , but many student residences form a space on space walk - culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship .
It can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
Nothing in the culture allows you to say , `` I love you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to leave , that I get the energy back , which I have used for the interaction with you . ''
Try to sense when a Man of conviviality anzuklopfen is exhausted - and send him a text message instead .
Speaking of call waiting : Do it .
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
He saw a few things .
Close friendship with baking .
As you begin the university at the height of the Back - mania , the beating on the doors of people , in order to present themselves with a plate full of brownies , is less strange than the greeting of the 1950 `` '' Welcome to the neighborhood , so I have something baked . And now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions. ``
Offering homemade treats is a good way to close friendships .
Their roommates feel obliged to entertain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a tasty morsel .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
As a result of poorly mixed lumps of flour , sugar and fat , people are sleeping , if you knock on the door .
To steal food , is a common crime in student residence halls .
Of course the claws of chicken is a theft , but is also taking a drop Milchs for your tea ?
Check this with the dairy owner .
The chances are good that they say , to serve themselves , even if they cook inside .
If someone steals your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal more balanced than my resident their milk added a detergent to punish thieves .
She is now in prison .
They should make no noise , which prevents people from sleeping or at work .
It is not just trying to be a decent man , but in the truest sense of the proverb you belong to the people who live in glass houses .
A girl on my floor asked their neighbors if it makes them a little , to make a little quieter drum & bass , because it 's three o'clock in the morning , and they had a test in the morning .
They responded with even more loud music .
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m. , they made their neighbours kindly still sleep two hours before they had their own music plärren , completed their door and came to their three hour examination .
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would move randomly in the same student residence ?
Conversely , it would not be abysmally embarrassing when you need to keep a newcomer for your future Ehepartnerin they yummie food separate again and see them every day and see how it pulls all the common friends to come over ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot newcomer is definitely not your future Ehepartnerin , you try at least , convince your abdominal a little common sense .
Lie in the exciting moment where you notice that someone has his keys in his not verschlossenem rooms , the line between a Ulk and bullying is fine as it seems .
A good prank is funny , but it takes only moments before he becomes a boomerang .
Give you by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but you never someone 's room with toothpaste and shampoo .
Close your door , and put the key in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but tackern their possessions on the ceiling is not more than twice .

Amnesty International Anti - arms fairs - watch video .

The Amnesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , the nonprofit is working with the graphic designer and voiceover artist , who also works for free .
VCCP - creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the silence that reigned around the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space of the excel calendar - and thought : `` We give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . ''
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising , but `` through the Einbläuen with bright colors and animation , it remains more liable . ''
`` They have done a fantastic job , they help us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the show , '' says Tom Davies of Amnesty .
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be traded illegally on our doorstep .
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair dates from the field within excel , where exhibitors reimbursing fantastic euphemistische products .

Robot cars : Government will lead to Germany
Germany should be technological advancements in the transformation of the car after the will of the federal government .
The federal cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which provides , among other things , investment in the development of digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt spoke of a `` new automotive era on Wednesday on the sidelines of the IAA auto show in Frankfurt . ''
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide for less congestion , Dobrindt said .
He will also discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries , at the IAA also meet with representatives of the industry .
The strategy of the Ministry of Transport stresses , among other things , the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio .
The testing of new technology is currently a test track at the Highway 9 in Bavaria .
To be saddled with the driver `` no additional liability risks , '' the federal government wants to review the legal framework `` and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . ''
Like Germany , for example , internationally to ensure that the speed limit for cars drive themselves will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
The federal government will also push for a revision of the Vienna Convention , which so far only the people as drivers .
In automated driving takes the lead in increasing the car , the driver will be more and more to the passenger .
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the surroundings and process the information in a matter of seconds .
According to a study presented by the Ministry , highly automated driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible .
Yet driverless vehicles on public roads `` were to be expected until well after 2020 . ''
The added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features in Germany , the study 's authors estimate for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros .
`` The digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency on the road , '' said the SPD politician Sören Bartol .
The question of liability in the event of an accident and the security of the personal information of the driver should be clarified , however .
Yet the Germans see cars drive themselves skeptical , however , much more than the French or Americans .
A poll by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra presented on Wednesday at the AA has come to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , in 20 years with this count of 32 percent , 31 percent do not think at all about it .
In France , 21 percent of respondents expect 33 % by 2025 with autonomous driving cars in the United States .
Anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self driving vehicle .
According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom , only seven percent would agree to cede control over the entire ride on all roads .
On the motorway could imagine that as much as 15 % in flowing traffic , 45 percent in a traffic jam .
Good one in four car would leave the control under any circumstances .

Friends : The comedy show , which grants us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is evident , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become even more desperate than ever , as shown on a 15 year high suicide rates among young men .
In 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common in men than in women .
In a bid to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM - campaign against a pathetic life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of calling into question the culture that prevents men to seek help if they need it .
Friendship is at the heart of the fight , in order to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that , if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with `` healthy '' mood , doubled his chances of recovery .
For those who are not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems .
But , of course , you have to have friends first , so a friendship can work .
In the age of communications conducted on social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , funny and successful life , even if in reality dominates the isolation .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has a profound impact on our mental health .
And like a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money can not buy happiness really .
The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been put on the head .
Each character was not defined by his work , but his personality , which was due to the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs , moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the longing between Ross and Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case , even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings .
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me : ... `` my audience role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
The men who contact us , often feel unable to talk with friends .
The old saying `` I come to make sense of it '' has a huge impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , if you talk about problems openly. ``
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more permanent management mechanisms .
They clearly presents the small moments of male friendships .
As much as my objective outsider status on the phone may also help the people in times of despair , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so , if you visit this weekend Comedy Central friends stuck with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink with the Central perk .
Or , better yet , if you see someone just sitting around in Starbucks , give him a smile and say hello .
You never know what difference could make your friendship .
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - tied for # friends

In New , Guardiola made a chain of four with David Preußen in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng who defend it well .
Mario Idol after what problems back in the squad sat out first .
The World Cup hero was only given the green light after the completion of training , sporting director Matthias Sammer in `` Sky '' said : `` If you want to make something different , that is evil . ''
At the first change , Guardiola decided against him , when he brought for the beleaguered Lewandowski Kingsley Coman ( 59th ) .
Idol arrived late for Arturo Vidal ( 76 . ) and made everything clear , via a penalty kick 13 minutes later , Muller took it up a notch .
Before the game , it came to riots at the stadium .
After a small group of some vermummten Bayern fans in her audience apparently had provoked the supporters of host of Piraeus with words and gestures , attacked the security forces and went against the Munich trailer with truncheons .
At least one Liverpool fan was injured transported out of the stadium .

Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from England 's team , but it is still difficult
To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when you look at the squad , which was selected for the tour of England , a repeat of the 3 - 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not rule out a home victory .
Alastair Cook 's side is probably less than it was three years ago , but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will bear no scars from 2012 , only a youthful and positive attitude .
With the ball , Moeen Ali as a spin - Bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , is an option for the attack .
Related news : Adam Lyth leaves England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex catastrophic effect .
The decision to let Adam Lyth , of course , is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire .
In his seven tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results .
There was no question mark at Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nomination , because - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser .
Long ago , the race would be extended from Lyth , but he had control over its own destiny .
If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire , is another opportunity .
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even if he is not so good services rendered , and this does not surprise me ; he is first and foremost a team man .
The question of how much time a test - a man gets to put his character is difficult .
Lyth had seven opportunities , such as Sam Robson before him , while Nick Compton got nine .
Only Compton got the chance to play at home and abroad .
The only criticism one can make that Jonathan Trott , England first began in the Caribbean , when Lyth was in peak form , but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex is catastrophic , and he is a hit man , which I appreciate .
He is an X factor - cricket player , what we saw in Yorkshire early in this season , when he scored against us on a Trent Bridge pitch 236 , which hit us very much .
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him , but this of course depends on the team at a position in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of Moeen beat along with Cook , which would provide an extra spin - Bowler and receive four Quicks appeared on , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a man can not beat them , and this has already shown that he is a vicious guy of cricket players left - handed .
Moeen has perhaps not done his job for his county , Worcestershire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop , before he appeared in 2001 as an opener .
He has made three hundred runs straight away and not looked back .
Zafar Ansari is the spinner in the squad as back up , and in my limited dealings with him , he impressed me as a young man .
People might see his statistics , an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball , and think it is a punt , but there are a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff .
The appointment of the batsman Mahela Jayawardene from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup .
He is one of the nicest guys in the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood is for the white ball - phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful force in the setup .
I always felt that he has created for the international cricket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit .
Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room , even if the messages are in line with the above .
Collys teammate in Durham , Ben stokes , is not used in the One Dayers , Root received a similar break against Australia and for my part , I have no problem with that .
Some will disagree , but coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable .
And you have to remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
Such decisions are not taken with a light heart .

The Brulljesmacher from much
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a village whose inhabitants are called off .
This property combines some of the billionaire , wants to be the US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for Aufreger .
Whether he is xenophobic journalists revealed Male regard or knowledge gaps in the policy of international crises - the candidate for the US presidency twists vigorously in the election campaign .
And is doing well here .
This is also registered in much stronger recovery , where the grandparents of Immobilienmilliardärs donors .
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a concept many in the wine village on the wine route .
Some people in the village of 1200 inhabitants is about dozen corners is related to him .
His grandfather came from much in the Palatinate : Donald Trump , here in campaign mode .
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump .
And what do the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I believe that somehow find this exciting , but are also not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter type , '' says Simone Wendel .
The native Kallstädterin has shot an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts , which in addition to Trump , the Heinz ketchup family matters .
In `` Kings of much '' ( 2014 ) , Trump , who is not known for modesty , is also to speak - as with the statement that he would certainly be successful , if he would live in much .
The king of hearts , he has not put it there .
While there is respect for the power of the family , but also tend to have the opinion that Trump `` was a bit of a big mouth , '' says Wendel .
Coincidentally , had the nickname that much was in the area , `` The Brulljesmacher '' - to much of the country : The show , she says .
So Trump comes from the village of the show .
The Trump 's success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immigrated and opened a restaurant in the United States for gold miners .
The foundation of the real estate company were first land purchases in New York .
But the lives of the grandparents was not without tragedy : Her desire to return to the home in the long term , failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Palatinate belonged at the time .
He did not include Trump because he once was hewn down without permission , had declared a film start of Roland Paul , director of the Institute for pfälzische history and folklore .
Trump is the grandson of an `` illegal immigrant . ''
This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of descendants .
Had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
`` As the noise , it is not so nice , '' says Hans Bender , a distant relative of Trump 's ( `` The grandmother was born Trump , the grandpa was born Heinz '' ) .
The retired vintner aufbrausend sees the Americans rather aloof , `` he is always so . ''
Does he think that Trump is ?
`` I can not imagine , '' says the 72 years old .
`` He has never much bothered about . ''
Pension innkeeper Veronika Schramm mentioned as some Kallstadter arrived in a visit , a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which is generally good .
`` I can not imagine the Donald , '' says the 68 years old .
You think it would be better if he has not treated the election , because `` the such radical views , I do not know whether this is a good thing . ''
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States , he would have been , `` he would never arrived at all . ''
`` There are more interesting topics than him , '' says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler .
And as President ?
`` It is not my President , '' she says .
And : `` The grapes are also ready for Trump without the president . ''
Wendels film , for which Trump was interviewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 moviegoers , also the interest awakened in the United States .

Project Hieve : Details are on the table
The plans for the cottage settlement on the Little Sea in Emden take shape .
The investor said plans for the project for the first time in public .
A number of residents are still worried - they fear the selling off of their leisure sanctuary
For months had been negotiated behind closed doors , pondered , debated and scarred .
Now plans are on the table for a new cottage settlement on the Little Sea near Emden .
The prospective customer , the midsize Emder company `` system building , '' said on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council his plans publicly for the first time .
Originally had this item on the public part of the agenda .
Under pressure from critics of the project and the FDP Group , which accuse the investors and the administration 's secrecy , Ralf Behrends of the system construction management went on the offensive : `` We still do not have an answer to all the questions , '' he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now .
The expensive around ten to twelve million euro project is in the discussion for months .
Strong reactions among marine shops owners who had come to the meeting , called the images and new details on the desired Hotelbau .
Roberto Schulz , marine shops owner and a board member with the interests of the local residents , Pro Hieve , complains : `` This is a huge block that overlooks all the other building . ''
He like many other project critics also fear that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase sharply : `` That whole Busladungen must come , so that it makes sense , '' says Schulz
What exactly is happening on the well a hectare site of the former restaurant , however , is still open .
Still , there is no operator .
`` First we must have a more consistent approach , '' said Ralf Behrends .
Because this was still missing , the building plans are also more variable .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP , the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
The controversial private arbitration for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which is much more traditional dishes in its operation .
`` We want to set up a system , which the public trust , '' the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation .
The Swede has to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in free trade talks with the United States .
The German government announced support .
By TTIP is the world 's largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
The plans to reform the current arbitration see specifically that the EU countries and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment Court .
They should come to equal parts of the EU , the US and from third countries .
There is also , for the first time , a second instance .
It would make it possible to appeal against sentences .
So far the procedures involved with each other agreed to referee a chance to appeal against their sentences did not exist .
In the debate over the past few months has become clear that the old system of ISDS citizens are not familiar in terms of fairness and justice , said Malmström .
In the long run they will work according to their own figures on an international investment tribunal .
There could then be resolved , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
The investor state arbitration required mainly by large corporations ( ISDS ) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , riding on the company compensation at the expense of the taxpayer , can scuttle national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
First opinions anti - TTIP organizations like Campact described the EU Commission 's proposals as insufficient .
Criticism was , above all , that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CETA ) .
The German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) called the plans , on the other hand , a major advance .
The Commission was prepared to take on board in the spring with other EU trade ministers in the reform of key points , the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel .
The old system of private arbitration is off the table .
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström .
The European business association BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules restrict the legal possibilities of the economy .
Small and medium sized companies in particular could be adversely affected , they said .
When the talks on the free trade agreement can be concluded TTIP ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , remained unclear on Wednesday .
The negotiations run since the middle of 2013 .
The issue of investor protection has been discussed but not with the United States .
Originally a framework for the agreement are already at the end of this year .
This date is no longer tenable .

BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station because of its `` dumbing down ''
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals .
He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
House colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 `` turns '' on Classic FM , claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the channel , to prove that he does something the private broadcasters do not .
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the BBC bosses that public service radio is `` verdumme '' and increasingly unable to distinguish from its commercial competitors .
`` Radio 3 seems like - I do not use the word '' verdummen `` - but it seems to turn on Classic FM , '' he said .
He was also on the BBC Music Awards , which launched last December .
The BBC Music Awards , launched last year , The Brits seem to be just under a different name .
So , if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only imitate what is already on the market , `` said Mr Bingham .
BBC Director General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and information to the public .
What I learned from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unmatched .
`` And the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and to commission new works , I think it really is important , '' he said .
Earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that needs to be worked harder to engage the audience , as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
Radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee for Culture , Media and Sport for the selection of commercial rivals to engage on the feet .
The Tory MP Damien Collins resorted to the BBC - the musical talent show The Voice , which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million .
See you why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show , with Paloma Faith and boy George as a judge , `` was produced on a special BBC way ' .
He added that he would find that the company `` a hit from our own stall , '' when we launch the next time an entertainment series .
However , he refused to rule out the appointment of another series of The Voice in the future or to spend tax payers money on other entertainment formats .

Terraced houses for refugees , single parents , low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
So , for example , for refugees , but also as a signal : `` Wohnhraum need not only refugees , but also the single mother and the low earners . ''
`` I can show how to build cheap and good even today , '' says the 44 years old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are in the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created : It builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees .
Mr Gildner , many refugees are in the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability .
Because people are to a large extent here .
In the face of the refugee flow , we also need adequate housing in the next few decades .
A very commonplace , three storey terraced house is the solution .
Gildner : A terraced house needs the least space .
It facilitates the integration .
This is different , if it brings people in residential blocks .
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three units for each four asylum seekers .
Each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back again .
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs .
What are the costs ?
Gildner : The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000 , without a plot .
This is manageable .
Six months has taken the construction .
This is appropriate .
The building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gildner : Construction law , I have learned through my project properly .
It is particularly complicated always expect the looming sword and the pitch regulation .
Gruselig .
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three pitches .
Only in the cities is not the place for it .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How did the residents responded to her townhouse project ?
Gildner : There have been those who have accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
What is definitely not true .
But do not tighten the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : Is true : We had a construction boom in the last five years in Germany , but luxury apartments have been built , can hardly afford any more .
My project has the message that ordinary people need housing too .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low earners .
I show how we can still build well .
That is what this is all about .

JVA Berlin Tegel : Five square cell are degrading
The German constitutional court has given a former prisoner of the Tegel prison establishment right , which was housed in a small cell for months .
Because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
That the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision published on Wednesday .
Those affected can even then hope for money , according to the judges , if they were only a few days locked in tight spaces ( ref . : 1 BvR 1127 / 14 ) .
Berlin Tegel between June and November 2009 , so that a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : He was in the prison hospital , housed in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was not spatially separated .
Then the man , according to his lawyer has now been released , has been moved to a larger cell .
Although his office failed liability lawsuit against the country because of the inhumane conditions in Berlin .
But the constitutional judges stressed the judgment of the Kammergerichts Berlin and referred the case back for reconsideration .
They see violating the dignity of the man .
Chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if only a few days in jail for the compensation of the period in question were instrumental for legal reasons , was given a compensation claim , they said .
Otherwise , would be `` an atrophy of legal protection of personality to fear . ''
The High Court must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation .
The constitutional judges have in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
So she spoke only in April of a detainee in damages because he was locked naked in a cell .

Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Smokers , thus not only damages the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long term study .
The good news : Not decreases the risk quickly .
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
It is clear from the long term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
The risk of losing their teeth early compared with nonsmokers , smokers that you up to 3.6 times higher .
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants .
Causes of tooth loss are dental caries and inflammation of the tooth meat stresses the DIfE .
For this gum disease , smoking is a risk factor , say the authors .
The connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers .
Unknown to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries .
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time , the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research. ``
However , it could take more than ten years before the risk back to the level of nonsmokers sinke , explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham .
We need to persuade people to be smoking , study director Heiner Boeing from DIfE said : `` Smoking shortens the life . ''
Not to smoke is good for the lungs and blood vessels and leads to a good dental health into old age according to our findings .
In Germany are affected about 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of toothlessness , DIfE shared with .
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increase the risk for early tooth loss .
The new long term study untermauere the findings .

Peter Moody says that stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the racing
Peter Moody claims that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to end the race immediately .
He appealed to the stewards and the Integritäts department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the race , and he himself had found under difficult conditions , when it comes to the positive cobalt swab test at Lidaris was that he could not explain .
He had 18 months because of the espionage accusations withheld and did not want it `` look like grapes hanging too high . ''
`` I was going to say nothing , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , Moody said .
You know that it went .
Sometimes you respond , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk with my head held high , and I want my owners think I try my best for them .
When they start to think that I am not doing that , then I should no longer be coach .
Then I have to think about what I do with my license .
Previously , Moody had the bomb in an interview with racing.com walk that the Integritäts department had tried to spy on his stall .
`` Eighteen months ago , Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables , in order to provide information about what I am doing in my stables , '' Moody said of Racing .
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster .
If that is the case , they should certainly look to their noses because they have failed in an attempt to keep it .
Robert Roulston , former chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of the RVL , were aware of this at the time , and it still is .
That should bring me to the view that it will be personally ?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and perhaps people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I so bad for the industry ?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am .
Maybe they need to give me my license and offend me , and I have no doubt that what I say , think about it .
But I am now at the point where it is no matter to me , and that makes me sad .
It makes me really sad .
I am going to put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The frustrations levels of the trainer , with the protracted cobalt on Lidari 's investigation , and the late scratching meant that he said that he `` his license could throw on the table . ''
Moody , best known for his preparation for the unbeaten Black Caviar Master , described the race-day treatment rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or clay on the horses legs had been applied , which breached against the rules .
`` It is against the rules of racing .
I have to take full responsibility for this , `` he said .
`` One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg .
It would have been so last night .
It would have been all day yesterday , which was true .
But it also had it on race day .
Moody with a three month disqualification to be confronted with the treatment of the pack on race day . An investigation into this matter was opened .
It is a joke .
People who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse .
`` We all understand that we need rules , but here they have gone too far , '' said Moody .

In an emergency call professor to have shot his girlfriend admits
In an emergency , Professor Shannon Lamb with a slightly quavering told the police that he had shot his girlfriend , and that officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb , it was important to point out that his `` sweet dog '' but still live and likely to be excited , and he said that the dead woman 's family contacts could be found on the phone .
Inside the house , the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was gekritzelt on a white block : `` I am so tired of doing it , I wanted to , I could make it back , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . '' This was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
There was no indication that Lamb , who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , was already 300 miles went to the school grounds , according to the police , a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his office was shot and killed .
Delta State University police chief Lynn said Wednesday that university staff the shooting at 10 : 18 p.m. have heard .
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that .
By the end of the day , there was another death : Lamb committed suicide as the police einkesselte him .
A day after the shootout at the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated lamb .
The investigators at both ends of the state published details , as well as revelatory as students and staff who knew him , helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
Students said that they were happy to his teaching .
The police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book written by him , in which he referred to the `` beautiful people '' with whom he shared his academic life .
They both taught in the department of social sciences and history , whose teaching staff consists of 17 members , and many students attended classes from both .
At the same time , there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors .
A student , Brandon Beavers , praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous , `` as if something was wrong with him . ''
Another student , Mikel Sykes , said that Lamm had told him that he was at the end of the academic year 2014-15 had to do with stress .
Lamb the Delta State University , had previously asked for a leave for health reasons , and said that he had a health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
The latest changes in the employment of the university meant that the promotion of the lamb had worked so hard for him , no guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor .
University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but , of course , `` there was something in Mr Lambs idea . ''
These are questions that can no longer answer lamb .
After fleeing the campus , the police found later Lambs lane when he scored again in Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be arrested lamb killed , selbstmit a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said .
His car was still in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
In 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy .
He received his doctorate in education in the spring .
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla hair tone said she was 15 and 20 lamb was when she met through mutual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her the guitar .
He was at the time , the women flock .
All the girls melted away when he was there , `` said hair tone , now 40 , and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident .
Lamb and Prentiss were apparently some time together .
In an emergency , Lamb said , `` I have killed my wife , '' but there was no certificate of marriage .
They had a dog named Lightning , who was with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier .
The police said that the dog was fine .
The former husband of Prentiss , Shawn O 'Steen , said they had been divorced 15 years ago , but have remained friends and had a daughter , who is now 19 years old .
`` She was totally destroyed on the ground , '' O `` Steen said of his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
`` Steen said he had never met lamb , but by using his daughter , he heard that lamb was interested in music and blues .
Lamb hit Prentiss , when he and Abigail three years ago at a summer fair .
Later , they played a gig .
`` Steen said that his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a barman and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a dimly lit bar near Gautier , said that he and Prentiss , Lamb Night in the night of September 5 , the last time I saw after Lamb , his guitar and harmonica play stopped in front of a sparse crowd had ended .
There was no signs that anything was wrong .
`` Just a happy couple , '' he said .
We were laughing and joking with each other on the up .
I think they both had a good sense of jokes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student 's committee .
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community in a Kerzenlicht-commemoration .
Schmidt 's wife , Liz , and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil , the university choir `` Bright Morning Star '' and `` Amazing Grace '' while singing .
Classes will be resumed on Wednesday .
`` We are trying to get our students to return , '' said LaForge .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb described in his emergency Prentiss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have never married .

A Two-Out Walk for J.D . Martinez Victor Martinez brought into play , `` a single up the middle '' on the first run of the game .

Then , of course , they taste pure or sweet dishes .
A mango , hearty dishes but a special touch .
It softens the bitter taste of some green salads such as chicory and Colonnata lard and Radiccio .
And a Mangochutney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and venison .

Eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
Eleven years ago I moved and even forgotten 19-year old into student housing , still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the strained smile of those who I have annoyed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned , can be distilled into eight simple rules .
The entry into student residences range from slightly fraught and absolutely terrifying .
It is tempting to tell schwatzen : People where you come from and where you 've taken sabbatical where you are in relation to Corbyn and why you love Marmite `` frankly neither hate nor because seriously guys , it 's just a yeast extract hahaha , '' I am in my room .
Breathe through .
And help others to do the same - Do questions and they show interest .
It draws the conversation and helps you to identify the people who you would like as opposed to those with whom you do not speak , even if your eyelashes were on fire and that fire extinguishers .
Let people .
The rooms of people turning into beverage receptions , movie night venues and local venues , but they are also the places where people dress up and back into their underwear .
Related to this : You do not need to start out at the university with a relationship
Introverted get a rough treatment at the university .
Your room should be a refuge , but many students residences form a room-to-room-pedestrian culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship .
This can be a hell for someone who is trying to recover .
Nothing in the culture allows you to say : `` I love you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you have to go away , so I get the energy that I have used for the interaction with you . ''
Try to feel when a Man is exhausted by sociability - and it will send an SMS knocking him .
Speaking of knock : You do it .
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
He saw a number of things .
Close friendship with baking .
Since the university at the height of the Back-mania start is the knock on the doors of people with a plate full of Brownies , less strange than the greeting of the 1950 's `` Welcome to the neighborhood , I gave you a little baked , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . ''
Homemade to offer is a good way to close friendships .
Her housemates feel obliged to talk and will probably end up associating your face with a tasty morsel .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
Poorly mixed up lumps of flour , sugar and fat cause people are asleep when you knock .
To steal food , is a common crime in student residence halls .
Of course , the mouth of chicken is a theft , but it is the capture of a drop Milchs for your tea ?
Check it with the dairy owners .
The chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook inside .
If someone steals your belongings , it is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my resident , who added their milk a detergent to punish thieves .
She is now in prison .
You should not make noise , which prevents people from sleeping or from work .
It is not just a question of being a decent man , but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb to the people who are sitting in a glass house .
A girl on my floor asked their neighbours to ask them whether it is something a little quieter drum & bass , because there are three o'clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
They have responded with even more loud music .
When she finally stopped at 5 p.m. , they left their neighbours are grateful to sleep two hours before they had their own music blaring , completed her door and went to her three hours of testing .
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to occupy the same student housing ?
On the other hand , it would not be abysmally embarrassing if you are a resident of your future Ehepartnerin , special to separate them , and then they have to look at every day and perhaps see how it moves across all common friends ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a resident is definitely not your future Ehepartnerin try , at least , persuade your abdomen a little common sense .
Leave in the exciting moment when you realize that someone has his keys in his room not verschlossenem , the boundary between having fun appealed and bullying is finer than it seems .
A good prank is funny , but it takes only moments before he becomes a boomerang .
Submit by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but you never to flood someone 's room with toothpaste and shampoo .
They lock their doors , and they put their keys in a glass of water , then place in the freezer - but you are tackern their possessions on the ceiling , no more than twice .

Friends : The comedy show that we are serious lessons about male friendship grants
The lack of similar images in the show is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever , as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high .
In 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it is three times more common in men than in women .
In a bid to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM - Campaign announced against a pathetic life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of challenging the culture in question , rivalling the men to seek help when they need it .
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the suffering a sufficiently high percentage of friends with `` healthy mood '' had his chances of recovery are doubled .
For those who are not depressed , half a circle of mentally healthy friends , the risks of mental problems .
But , of course , you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
In the age of social media 's communications , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
Our digital lives are lively , strong , and to be successful , doubled , even though , in reality , dominates the isolation .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsischer values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health is much deeper .
And like a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money can buy happiness , not really .
The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down .
Each character was not defined by his work , but because of his personality , which was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey and his frequent hugs , moments when football peering in comfortable armchairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to , in any case , even if they are often withhold to fully explore their feelings .
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me : ... `` my audience role for people who are feeling depressed and at risk of suicide , has really made me see how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
The men who contact us , often do not feel able to talk with friends .
The old saying `` I come in , '' has a huge impact on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly. ``
Friends one of the shows that comes to my mind is when I try to offer langfristigere coping mechanisms .
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships .
So my objective outsider status on the phone to people in moments of despair may also help , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so when you visit this weekend with the Comedy Central ) festival to celebrate the day , completely redesigned scenery , why do n't you take your friends for a drink at the Central Perk .
Or , even better , if you sit in Starbucks to see someone alone , you give him a smile and say hello .
You never know what difference could make your friendship .
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # friends fixed

Robot cars : Government wants to lead for Germany
Germany is supposed to be according to the will of the federal government to change the car technological pioneers .
The federal cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the house by Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which includes , among other things , investment in the development of digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the fringes of the IAA auto show of a `` new era of mobility . ''
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide less congestion , Dobrindt said .
He also wants the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries to discuss at the IAA also meet with representatives of the industry .
The strategy of the Transport Ministry , among other things , emphasises the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid Umstiegs on digital radio .
For the testing of new technology , a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently under construction .
Thus , any additional liability risks are saddled with the driver , `` '' the federal government wants to review the legal framework `` and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . ''
So , for example , Germany wants to engage internationally to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
In addition , the federal government wants to push for a change to the Vienna Convention , which stipulates only the people as a driver .
The automated driving the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver will be more and more to the passenger .
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data within seconds .
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020 .
Nevertheless , driverless vehicles on public roads `` were not expected until well after 2020 . ''
The added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
`` The digital networking of the cars can be safer and more efficient to run on the road , '' said the SPD transport politician Sören Bartol .
The question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of personal data , however , the driver needs to be clarified .
The German self driving cars , however , are sceptical - much more than the French or the Americans .
A Wednesday at the AA 's poll by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars in the next ten years will prevail , only 32 percent expect it in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it .
In France , 21 percent of respondents expect with autonomous driving cars by 2025 , 33 percent in the United States .
Anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self .
According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom , only seven percent would agree to give up control over the entire trip on all roads .
On the highway that could be present in the flowing traffic as much as 15 percent to 45 percent in a traffic jam .
Well , one in four would car control under any circumstances .

Four people were killed after police fire rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people , including a 4-year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police rubber bullets shot into a crowd of people who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , Chief District official , said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station , some of them throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr Dhakal said that the police had used tear gas and shot into the air before they grip on rubber bullets .
20 policemen and five civilians were injured , he said .
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber bullets , is known by those that they can kill , but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal 's southern plains , where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces that are formed in the context of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want a state of their own .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clashes since the 10th
Killed in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but it is a very contentious issue in Nepal , which has been ruled for centuries .
Work on a new constitution since 2008 , is on the way , but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that has killed thousands of people in April .
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution would come into force on Sunday .

Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener tip as a fashion niche
Before it went to the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen making meters .
The embroidered fabrics and lace in a large amount of customers who , for example , they processed to blankets and curtains .
That no longer works alone , Andreas Reinhardt , managing director of fashion tip Plauen explains .
Instead , the fashion is important .
In the early days of the Plauener top fashion played a major role , was then replaced by the domestic textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt gives some examples : Top in jewellery , accessories such as handbags and regional costumes .
Indeed , says the vintage fashion , which in past eras , a growing business potential .
Anyone who served in the textile industry in Germany is not a niche , is no longer on the market .
With us , they already account for half of all orders .
Fashion tip Plauen , along with nine other companies in the industry association Plauener lace and embroidery .
Only they can wear the protected label .
In the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales are tonight .
Private shops and wholesale , there are almost no more .
Our products reach the customers in this way .
Today , the commodity will be manufactured in Asia , much cheaper and sold almost exclusively on chains .
In addition , the export schwächle , currently to Russia and the United States .
So , enough reason for new routes .
The industry association is trying to score points by environmental awareness , as Cordula Bauer explains the stick pearl in Falkenstein : `` Since this year , we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable . ''
Reinhardt added : `` It also refers to the materials used . ''
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg Branch of the West Saxon Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace .
To counter the competition from Asia , you need to find high quality and innovative products .
It takes time and courage .
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and businesses who need to think , especially economically , `` Schmidt says .
Therefore , an existing design will often vary only slightly to keep a customer base .
A few years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter revitalized the historic snowball head .
However , the machine uses small beads in some places .
The Plauener Goldsmith champion Bianca Hall Bach did it inspire Krauße became : `` Before I could start with traditional Plauener tip nothing . ''
Now she uses the snowball head for her jewellery .
In an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
`` Many people in the region to identify with the topic of Plauener tip - young and old , '' says Reuter .
It also returns to the US , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area , and who want a piece of memory .
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener lace .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP ,
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP , the EU Commission has a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
The controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between corporations and states , therefore , are to be replaced by a more transparent system that meets its operation significantly more traditional dishes .
`` We want to set up a system to which the public trust , '' said the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation .
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in free trade talks with the United States .
The German government announced support .
TTIP through the world 's largest free trade zone is to emerge with 800 million people .
The plans for reform of the current arbitration can see clearly that the EU countries and the United States jointly independent judges to select a new investment tribunal .
You have to come in equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
There is also a second instance for the first time .
It would allow it to appeal against judgments .
So far , the procedure agreed among themselves to referee , an appeal against their sentences , there was not .
In the debate over the past few months , it is clear that citizens of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice , not trusted , Malmström commented .
In the long term , she wants to work according to their own figures on an international investment tribunal .
For example , there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
Especially those of large corporations demanded Investor State Arbitration ( ISDS ) is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
The traditional arbitrators are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel judicial system , the companies can wrest compensation at the expense of the taxpayer to circumvent national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
In the first statements described anti-TTIP organizations like Campact , the EU Commission 's proposals as insufficient .
The criticism that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CETA ) .
The German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a major step forward .
The Commission needs to reform key points , the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers have drawn up .
The old system of private arbitration is off the table .
The French government welcomed the plans by Malmström .
The European business association BusinessEurope warned to limit the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
Particularly small and medium sized businesses could be disadvantaged by it .
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will be completed on Wednesday remained unclear .
Negotiations are under way since the middle of 2013 .
The issue of investor protection has been discussed but not with the United States .
Originally a framework should be for the agreement at the end of this year .
This date is considered to be no longer tenable .

XI urges to open up the economy more broadly for the world
The economy needs to be more open to the outside world to promote growth , President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday , a group that has been entrusted with the management of the reform .
`` China should commit itself to foreign investment and expertise to attract and improve strategies for business , '' he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group on the deepening of comprehensive reform .
Fostering startups and further reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and provide new space for economic growth , Xi said .
The leadership group has adopted a series of policies , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border control policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SOE ) , private capital , and overhaul of the city 's reporting system .
According to the statement , a negative list is created to identify the sectors and companies that do not qualify for investment .
The system will be gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources to ensure a fair business environment and the market open , the statement said .
The government will also loosen controls on the powers given to the businesses and ensure that companies decide how they run their business .
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of international economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
As part of a bid to open state-controlled sectors , other areas will be opened up to private investment .
`` The government will change its policy towards foreign investment and protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them , '' the statement said .

Croatia : `` We are the refugees . ''
`` Now the controls are also on our southern border , high risks , '' said Home Secretary Johanna Mikl-Leitner .
The checks at the Hungarian border , remain at the same time .
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum , this could also , of course , `` '' .
The care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
But it is also clear that `` we need clear signals , '' said the minister .
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not on the Austro-Slovenian border .
It needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering `` corridor '' - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to allow refugees to travel on to Austria and Germany , and may also create corridors for the refugees .
Just saw this interior minister , Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana .
The idea of corridors was `` absolutely unacceptable , '' Slovenia will actually intensify the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary .
The border with Croatia is an external border of the Schengen area , by contrast , already heavily controlled .
As the minister stressed that Slovenia is to seal its borders to refugees .
`` Every EU member has to fill out its obligations , otherwise the system may not work , '' said Györkös Znidar .
As the Croatian government announced that the first refugees had already tried during the night hours on Tuesday to enter in the Ostkroatien Tovarnik / Sid over to evade the registration .
The Croatian police failed to take them in the nearby corn fields .
According to local media constantly police vehicles with new refugees arrive in the Croatian Tovarnik since then .
It is mainly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
Also , emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
In the coming days , his country with around 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister Ranko project said .
There are buses from Presevo , on the Macedonian-Serbian border , which has been brought to the Hungarian border , migrants were diverted towards Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media reported unanimously on Wednesday .
The government in Belgrade , however , denied that she had the Anweise people to follow certain routes : `` Neither we , nor do we want to do this , '' it said .
According to media reports , however , is the first bus arrived in the morning with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid , in the course of the day , more buses were expected .
On Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants were all night , around 500 kilometres away from the Macedonian border with Serbia .
`` We have heard that Hungary has closed down , so the police told us that we are supposed to go here , '' said one of the refugees .
They wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
Thus , it might actually have already predicted by observers to postpone the previous Balkan Route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary at a nearby stretch a little further west .
Croatia : `` Comprehensive opportunities for border control . ''
Croatia 's Interior Minister project had previously stressed that his country had prepared in the event of a large influx of refugees corresponding plans for possible emergency situations .
He gave no details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member `` comprehensive opportunities for border control .
We carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership of the Schengen area .
Slovenia is part of that , since 2007 , the EU partners represent the country consistently since a testimonial to what the standard of border controls .
On the Serb side , about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
According to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg continue to remain completely blocked .
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border , is still unclear .
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Horgos : He thought the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , is premature .
Currently , it would not be very high numbers of refugees .
It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
Migrant workers - dangerous - alternative routes rates
However , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps showing alternative routes are drawn by Croatia .
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless , however : In parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia is still not cleared minefields .
On Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern was sent to the border region .

Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Smokers not only harms the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long term study of Potsdam .
The good news : The risk of abandonment is falling .
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
This is apparent from the long term study of an international team of researchers , including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
Compared to nonsmokers , smokers , the risk of losing their teeth prematurely , the 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher .
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants .
Leading causes of tooth loss are dental caries and inflammation of the meat , the DIfE stresses .
This saliva dries somewhat smoking is a risk factor , the authors point out .
The link between smoking and tooth loss , therefore , go back to frequent gum inflammation in smokers .
It is not clear to what extent smoke also increased the risk of caries .
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time , `` the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research . ''
However , it could take more than ten years before the threat sinke back to the level of nonsmokers , explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham , England .
We have to convince people to take up smoking , study director Heiner Boeing said the DIfE : `` Smoking shortens the life . ''
Not to smoke in the lungs and blood vessels and is good for our findings to a good dental health well into old age .
In Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by loss , the DIfE announced .
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
The new long term study , the findings untermauere .

Europe 's refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closing the border , refugees back
Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte from the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and found that those who tried to come into the country illegally , all with the aim of halting the influx of migrants .
Chaos ensued at the border , when hundreds of migrants have refrained in a no man 's land , and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period in a strip of land along the road between the two checkpoints of countries and built tents and settled there .
But frustrations grew .
When a police helicopter was hovering above them , the migrants chanted `` Open the borders ! '' And shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police .
Some were in protest food and water .
Serbia 's foreign minister said that it was `` unacceptable '' that migrants from Hungary were returned , while more and more out of Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage .
It must take place in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries , `` Ivica Dacic said in Prague .
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a common immigration policy .
However , the ministers agreed that the responsibility for 40,000 people to share the überrumpelten in Italy and Greece had taken refuge , they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states further 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary , would resume .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent .
Hungary , however , was not his hopes for a speedy action from Brussels or from its neighbours .
On Tuesday , the state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , so that they could absperren roads and speeding up asylum procedures .
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto , meanwhile , said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants from the country - after it has finished a fence along the Serbian border .
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates in the race , the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia , were used .
In recent months , many war refugees in Hungary from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a major bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted , however , that most of the arriving economic migrants who are in search of a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that contrasts starkly with other EU states , including Germany .
The new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing the border or the Beschädigen of 4 meters ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government along the southern border with Serbia , wisely , a crime , these laws also set higher sentences for convicted traffickers .
`` Due to the situation caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand , '' government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
We say it very clearly : Illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament must still technically still agree with the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but by Associated Press reporters saw heavily armed soldiers at the border with vehicles and dogs for days already .
Gyorgy Bakondi , national security adviser for Orban , said that authorities 45 people to attempt to cross the border was arrested , 15 others were already penetrated deeper into the country .
You come across as they damage the fence , they are now in police custody and commit crimes are accused under the new laws .
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a Zugwaggon arrived with barbed wire to close the borders .
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , when the Hungarians , a small office in a metal container opened to edit the data of people and a lot of people put up there hineinzudrängen .
Around 20 could get it , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .

Almost two years after a student died during a bullying ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains , Pennsylvania , will be filed murder charges against five people .
Members of New York 's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun `` Michael '' Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 , brutal and delayed his journey to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police said .
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand has been charged , and has been attacked repeatedly , while he tried to have a frozen field on an objective approach .

The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood called the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital , according to the police .
However , they had the time to switch Deng 's clothes to Google his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng , the national president of the Brotherhood to obtain advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
`` At this point , the members began to hide utensils and the welfare of the Brotherhood were basically over that of Michael Deng , '' police chief Wagner said .
He could not be revived , and he died of his injuries the next morning .
According to an autopsy report , Deng were repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to the head , trunk and thigh .

For slightly overweight diabetics can be helpful for weight loss surgery .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes , according to a new study may take at least five years .
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data takes a long time for something to show , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert on weight loss surgery , an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery wrote .
Weight-loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
Over the years , obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most of the studies were carried out by people who pathologically obese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered as normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , the researchers used from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng General Hospital data since 2007 , they have gained in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery , gastric bypass and gastric tube education - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those who embarked on this operation , fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study .
Meanwhile , the BMI remained in those non-surgical diabetes treatments were roughly the same at 29 .
Among those who undergo surgery , at 36 % of the diabetes-disease completely and partially at 28 % .
In the medical treatment group was full of diabetes compared to only one percent and partly in only about two percent .
In addition , the results were in the control of blood pressure , triglycerides and `` bad '' LDL cholesterol `` generally better in the 'surgical ' group , '' the authors found .
The researchers also monitored the patient 's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c , blood sugar levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
After the surgery , the average hemoglobin A1c levels fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
But this `` better '' tooth control - as you are in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - do not reflect reduced mortality in five years , according to the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year had the bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrektomie Group lost more weight ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , achieved greater declines in BMI ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete removal of the diabetes ( 46,9 % vs. 16.7 % ) .
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Blackstone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
It was in the Swedish study of obese people who undergo a Adipositas operation , about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried konventionellere methods .
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients showed , Blackstone said , it should be reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process .
`` This is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower , '' without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with a BMI between 27 and 30 .
`` I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that a reversal `` as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , it is really difficult .

Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy praise rather than criticism of his own behaviour .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo , which is always referred to as `` Special Ks , '' came the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after his opponent had to Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison twice to be separated by the referee , where Harrison stated : `` Beat Wawrinka had Kyrgios , and I should beat the child . ''
While he was last seen , as he smashed a tennis racquet , after a spasm of a potential US Open victory in Group foiled , Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard an artist 's in the Davis Cup semifinals against Great Britain .
`` One thing that I really ereifere me is the fact that , in my opinion , Thanasi was dragged into the dispute a little bit , '' Healy said .
He has broken a racket , because of a Krampfes lost in the US Open , but he is not the first player to make a racket out of frustration with himself has broken , and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , really , he was in the U.S. Open extremely well , even among the somewhat provocative circumstances , with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
He has a great team around them , he has a great family around them , and I think he was a little too strict .
He is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team , and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he will be respected in the dressing area , he trains hard , he is in good form , he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits .
Healy also supported the decision to take Kyrgios in the major preliminary decision , which starts on Friday , and he describes the `` joint decision '' as the right for everyone , but he assures the man from Canberra , as part of a long term return to the team. ``
`` First , we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not '' to all the controversy around [ Kyrgios ] , Healy said .
And I think Nick has managed to rise very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , it is in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and all the criticism he deserves , but we are trying to support him , we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think , is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him .

Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy proposes against rivals due to allegations of ring fight back
The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has been criticism of the tack of his players as `` agenda setting '' of two Premier League favourites of the NRL .
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the referees `` ring the Storm players fighting '' with his team during the high storm 's victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening have allowed .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team after his team won the finals against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night had achieved . He called the game a `` prime example '' of the Rugby League , and said that the two from Queensland `` not too well '' in the struggle .
The Tacklimg Bellamy defended his team and said that they were only focused on the tack , on their `` Contact . ''
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team confidently agree with him , because it means that they are concerned , the Storm team to be beaten .
`` It comes up again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke about wrestling matches than they have beaten us 24 : 2 , '' Bellamy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed throughout the year in our defensive system or techniques , but we have made over the last six weeks , our contact in football makes a real focus , and that has brought us to the turnaround .
Trent has been there for three years , and he is obviously losing a great team to train , and he is therefore probably not since , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
It 's funny how this appears again at this time of year .
Bellamy Bennetts idea attacked by the `` exciting football '' and his mentor recalls that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with `` boring '' football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , `` Bellamy said .
I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take a shit dirt .
But now he has a team that can play and what we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
This is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kind of players .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play the kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like this .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us .
Six weeks ago , they have probably not thought to us when it came to the big games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the game against Storm ROOSTERS achieved a higher score than the Broncos game against the Cowboys .
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game , I have not yet seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game 20 : 18 , there are two further attempts in our game , but it is an exciting game ?
Or breaks are no points and make something interesting ?
For me , it is the game plans .
When they talk to us , it means that we will be taking in a stage for them .
The Storm team has released this weekend , as they have won the right to either North Queensland Cowboys or the quiet surrounding the Sharks next Saturday night at AAMI Park to receive Vorfinale . The ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning .

8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is serious .
Some have tried to brand him as a flop .
Others have dismissed it as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw Donald Trump from the upper echelons of surveys downwards , it has not worked yet ( ) .
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump in double digits , and some start seriously to ask what the chances of the nomination of the real estate Moguls .
Of course , it is still too early in the term .
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that it was at this time in 2011 , Rick Perry 's leadership , given to the rising Herman Cain , none of which also won only one state in the nominating process .
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth economy now see Trump 's perseverance and begin to make their dollars go to overthrow him .
Here are some recent poll numbers that indicate that the real estate mogul , is not just a temporary phase .
Trump 's popularity ratings have revolved around 180 degrees .
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid June , showed a survey of Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul positively .
By the middle of July , there were 40 percent .
At the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump .
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
And these figures are in early states .
A Quinnipiac-vote in Iowa last week , has found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump .
Two thirds of the GOP GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate .
In a CNN / ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they were either `` enthusiastic '' or `` satisfied '' if Trump were nominated .
Only two out of 10 say they would be `` angry '' if he were the nominee .
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they are `` thrilled '' vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump ) .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio , with only 21 percent .
On the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters that they would be `` dissatisfied '' or `` angry '' when Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate said .
A majority of Republicans see Trump 's temperament is not a problem .
While Donald Trump widely for his bombastic and insulting statements will be criticised , 52 percent of Republicans negligible Irish voters that the real estate mogul and the right temperament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
The same number applies in the first primary state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander in chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
Nevertheless , 44 percent , that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively , and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
When they put their scholar hats , Republican voters think Trump is real .
When they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week , four out of ten , that Trump is the best bet .
This is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July , put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP voters had in the past , not the clearest crystal ball .
At this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry will win the nomination would only 28 % compared to the final candidate Mitt Romney .
However , it appears that a large number of GOP voters , Trump 's campaign as a plausible .
Even if the Republicans had a different candidate , Trump still beats almost everyone .
Some experts suggest that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump 's leadership , while the anti-Trump support to more than a dozen other candidates diffuse is distributed .
But a poll by Monmouth University at the beginning of September , shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates , Trump is reaping the majority support .
He has a 13 point lead over Carly Fiorina , Marco Rubio , 14 points ahead of Walker 15 points , 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally , Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie , 33 points .
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson was the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race overtake .
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have made up their minds .
A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump , say that they have lent their voices .
Of course , much can be done to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
However , Trump 's strongest competition at the moment , the other outsider , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have made up their minds , are twice as likely for Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration .
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called `` rapists '' immigration was the lynchpin in the public discourse in 2016 .
Some are concerned that the bombastic language of Trump crucial Hispano-Americans from the Republican Party will keep and which will damage Neuorientierungs 's efforts .
But according to the new ABC / Post poll on Monday , six out of 10 Republicans say that with Trump on issues of immigration .
So , as long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , it will also do seem to Donald Trump .
The frustration with the government climbs to new highs .
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson now accounts for around half of the support of Republican voters , especially by their outsider status .
Six out of 10 Republicans say the new Monday 's ABC / Post , they want a political outsider , rather than someone with government experience .
And they are also angry at Washington .
A poll by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago , shows that three out of four Iowa-Republicans about the Republicans in Congress are frustrated , dissatisfied with 54 percent , `` '' and 21 percent `` the angry . ''

Terraced houses for refugees , single parents , low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
So , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : `` Wohnhraum need not only refugees , but also the single mother and low earners . ''
`` I show how you still can build cheap and good , '' says the 44-year old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : He builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees .
Mr Gildner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
What solution you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The mass accommodation in containers or gyms have no sustainability .
Because the people are , to a large extent .
In light of the refugee flow , we also need enough housing over the next few decades .
A very commonplace , three storey terraced house is the solution .
Gildner : A terraced house needs at least .
It facilitates the integration .
It is different when you are under the people in residential blocks .
Each of the six houses that were built in the pilot project , consists of three apartments , each for four asylum seekers .
Each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs .
What are the costs ?
Gildner : The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000 , without a plot .
This is manageable .
Took six months of construction .
That is appropriate .
The building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gildner : Building , I have learned through my project .
Particularly complicated , it is always the impending special sword of Damocles and pitch regulation .
Creepy. ``
Still , it is assumed that anyone who creates a terraced house with three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
Only in the cities of the place is missing .
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
How did the residents responded to their terraced house project ?
Gildner : There were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
What is definitely not true .
But you do not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : It is true that we have had over the last five years , a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that can afford a little more .
My project is the message , the ordinary people need housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low earners .
I 'll show how you can still build cheap and good .
That is what it is all about .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses .

Ecumenical hospice help Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years

Vibrant , pralles lives in beautiful autumn sunshine and four large panels , each with the title `` Before I die I want to ... ''
The Ecumenical hospice help with this action on their 20th anniversary and certainly sees itself confronted with mixed reactions .
`` It is killed , so we went with the action in the midst of the city and the people , '' says Josefine Lammer .
The head of the Ecumenical hospice care is the passerby also available for questions and discussions , such as the volunteer staff .
While a passerby some spontaneous attacks on the chalk and the phrase `` yes my life , '' read `` to go '' with the campers from the United States , `` '' stop the war `` or '' not suffer `` added , while others are short , read , I say phrases like '' have not so far `` and then continue .
Time and time again , small discussions evolve on the fringes of the action itself , about life , dealing with the death .
Also , Peter Hübinger is on the ground .
`` Only if I am clear that , for me , comes at the end of the world , I can live responsibly , '' the director of the outreach work in Mannheim , together with the Caritas Association says the Ecumenical hospice help .
Therefore , this is public action for the 20 year olds .
The fact that not everyone wants to say publicly on the boards is understandable , however , because it is a very personal thing .

Hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with a crown of thorns ( gilded ) is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus old Post wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible , which is now published with magnificent images .
In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt , who has made over 150 motifs of his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
His `` language '' with bright colours and imaginative forms has received the 75 year olds - but what is not synonymous with `` funny '' images .
On the contrary , in line with the relevant issues that may seem pretty bleak .
Around three years , Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project , for which he is a subjective and artistic choice from the many areas of `` Book of Books '' .
Born cycles that address issues such as Way , plagues , bids or are our father .
Thus , he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : This applies to the Luther publishing with its theological orientation , as well as for the Kettler Verlag , with its focus on art books .
And as the author Klaus old post , who has worked on the basis of the painting with the respective Bible is especially challenging .
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt , and so to the present day , `` translated into current relationships .
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting .
They are embedded between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who is his own personal thoughts on the current situation .
The jewellery cover has golden letters .
This allows the 75-year old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high level of intimacy .
Emotions were the trigger for the Bible project : Otmar Alt , born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that the strict Protestant doctrine of Order .
`` The education was '' already with the cane , Otmar Alt recalls .
`` I have tried to come to terms with it , in order to cope with me , perhaps with the Lord father . ''
His second concern is to bring the art of fast moving time to more important : `` The perception of visual worlds from advertising , and that is loud .
Symbolism is out there .
Artists have a different pleasure and bliss to show things .
Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
`` In this respect , I am a dinosaur .
Otmar Alt wants the viewer into the images `` fall '' will be able to allow them to see and feel what power they have , `` the image to his counterpart . ''
Klaus old Post confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-old Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation , `` '' has always been a lover of Otmar Alts was art : `` I like how he sees with his life . ''
Alt did not care to fully comprehend the Bible , but selected the key for him , even mysterious topics .
`` This was not a cooperation on an equal footing , '' says old post : `` This is about the pictures , the text only explains . '' As a Bible .
For Hans Möhler from Luther 's publishing this work is an invitation to `` deepen his life and find freedom . ''
Otmar Möhler Alts images speak for both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation will be opened .

Election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over Bernie Sanders in a national poll halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against it .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 percent , while Sanders is in second place , with 27 percent ( an increase of 17 percent .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency , the support of 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries .
More than five months before the start of the primaries , most Democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates say they will support .
But Clinton 's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
Since the CBS News poll has Clinton on a number of demographic groups , while Sanders achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates , but these protrusions have narrowed .
Her support among men has dropped significantly , and Sanders is only 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a large lead among older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double digit lead over the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group .
About half of the Democratic voters in the primaries across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party .
A quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support them , because she is the candidate .
Six percent would not support it .
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton 's current supporters are particularly excited by it .
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would enthusiastically support .
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters who say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say that about their top candidates Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
If Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want it to be the candidate , the most common response is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Of Clinton 's supporters , their relationship with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is mentioned .
Consent to deal with the problems and the eligibility will also be cited .
As the Vice President raises a potential for the presidency , 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
If the primaries democratic voters are asked who would be the party for their second choice , Biden is at the top .
Of Clinton 's supporters , more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders .
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton 's lead over Sanders increases , by 20 points , with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
Fünfundfünfzig percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
Biden , a second is by far in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the `` most eligible '' has risen .
Nevertheless , the question of what is more important for a candidate to call Democratic voters questions about the eligibility .
Like last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters in the primaries as unacceptable .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates for their party 's primaries provide good results in a number of important characteristics of voters .
Majorities see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty , Clinton 's strength is in the lead .
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , more than twice as many say that Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic voters in the primaries , Clinton , Sanders and Biden are generally ideologically in line with their views .
In all of these measurements , about a quarter of Democratic voters had no opinion of Sanders .
As questions about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State , continue to be made , most Democratic voters in the primaries satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole .
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with their statement , while only about a third are satisfied .
Public opinion on this issue was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , divided .
Most Americans said that the email controversy has no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , while 36 percent said that their opinion of her has worsened .
They are mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
Although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this is still a problem for them , as a whole , among registered voters : Only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and less than 15 points since May .
62 percent of voters do not think it is an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time , 55 percent of voters nationally to see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy .
Clinton and Trump , however , get good marks for leadership .
Of the six candidates tested , Biden , Carson and Bush are doing best in honesty .
A majority believes Sanders more than honest , but , like Carson , many have no opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .

Brazil 's Rio Grande pädiatrische society promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding

Unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system .

Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep !
The ads disgrace Britain 's arms trade
Amnesty International anti-arms fairs video .
Dreadful murderers-drones !
Ankle zerschmetternde leg shackles !
Cluster bombs !
And electric shock sticks , causing agonising pain , but left no trace .
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world 's biggest arms fair is a combative parody , which was produced by Amnesty International , the willingness of the British government in the spotlight to bring weapons to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International : Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London 's Docklands to bestow gifts .

But a separate campaign also leads to a lot of posters at bus stops and metro-trains to see and which require a second look .
`` Important announcement : Go from 15 to 18 September , with the DLR ? '' ( Docklands Light Railway ) reads the characters of London Underground and the hallmarks of DLR line , which converts the image of a tank .
In September , a swarm of arms dealers will travel with the DLR ... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair .
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Dismaland Banksys .
A group called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution in London and used `` Ad Space Hack Packs , '' a £6 -Pack of Inbusschlüsseln , claiming that `` access to around a third of bus stops and advertising space on the planet gain . ''
Transport for London is the Plaka animal `` vandalism '' not funny .
One of the parody ads , which was produced by Special Patrol Group .
According to Gavin Grindon , curator of Crueol designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex , artists will be more critical and try to bring political work for the audience outside of galleries .
Many artists make themselves with activists in protest movements to work and say that they have to go out into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
Another of the anti-arms-posters greets the commuters in the subway .
The Amnesty video was more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , the nonprofit with the graphic designer and voiceover artist , who also works for free .
VCCP 's creative director Matt Lever was surprised at the silence around the advertising of the arms fair - there was a lacuna in the ExCeL calendar - and thought : `` We give them the campaign that they are trying to avoid . ''
They played with the invention of a more realistic dodgy firms advertising , but `` by the einbläuen with bright colors and animation , it remains more liable . ''
`` They have done a fantastic job in helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices to raise at the show , '' says Tom Davies , of Amnesty .
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not traded on our doorstep is illegal .
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair dates from the area within ExCeL , where exhibitors fantastically euphemistische products bestow gifts .

That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming , and the boom is flagging , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession .
We know that .
What we do not know how long it takes and how long it will last .
In particular , the story offers little guidance for the economy in the end .
A recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates is often , but not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial assets .
As a result , representatives of the US central bank so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when to start raising interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for the normalization .
In fact , several variables play a role .
In the end , however , market participants could see that the whole excitement has been exaggerated , possibly due to a rise in interest rates .
`` The Fed 's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of '' cheap money `` , '' Julian Jessop , economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still at very low levels , to the seismic shock that many seem to fear to lead .
That does not mean that there will be no impact .
Here 's a look based on historical trends , as some areas of the economy could respond :
As the market has seen in the last month , the anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
As soon as the increase arrives , the impact is not as dramatic .
`` There seems to be a trend that asset yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be strangled , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , '' said Deutsche Bank 's analysts in a recent study of what happens after the Fed 's interest rate increases .
More specifically , the market is usually in the past 35 years in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates , relatively flat over the next 250 days ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average return over the last six previous cycles of 14.4 percent , according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll , chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , published in Barron 's .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle , and thus increase the yield begins to decrease .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but they often promote raising interest rates .
In the current case , the Fed is faced with a number of conditions , which did not exist before and which could hasten a recession .
It is very noteworthy that GDP is close to its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed .
According to Deutsche Bank 's nominal GDP stood at the 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950 under 4.5 percent .
Although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few that will last and are waiting for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 percent .
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of `` whether it is different this time , '' said Deutsche Bank .
Participants throughout the year to a rate hike by the Fed have been taken , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee addressed this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe that an increase in the FOMC could approve this session , the futures trading is only a probability of 25 % .
`` In our study have all increased cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs very soon after the start of the recovery in the shadows asked , '' according to the report .
In contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
The current cycle is by far the longest , which the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
The fixed income was also volatile , because the market is anticipating a rate hike , and similar to the pattern rather than on the capital market .
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks , if they change their strategic course .
With bond yields seem to change direction , as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle .
At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately , Deutsche Bank said .
By Charles Schwab 's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve .
High-yielding bonds often bring better returns in such a climate , although `` we are still cautious , to expect higher yields , '' said Kathy Jones , European fixed income at Schwab , in an analysis .
Interestingly , Jones believes that the markets are already on the Fed 's policy and expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has changed , '' she wrote .
Short term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flatter , credit spreads have widened , and the volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market if the Fed tightens its strategy .
By and large companies that do most of their business in the US , will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive .
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market , and the financing of its debt .
`` History shows that '' quality `` stocks tend , three months after an initial rate hike to respond very positively , '' Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients .
Companies with strong balance sheets have surpassed companies with weak balance sheets for each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , an average of 5 percentage points .
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with low quality ( by an average of 4 percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debt will be a big problem .
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , Goldman said .
Outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
Savers could see profits through higher yields , although experts are divided on how quickly it will take place .

Experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Allegations of a publicly funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with ties to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
Experts in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , joined Lancet , by the Public Health England ( PHE ) in her report on e-cigarettes used evidence .
PHE published the `` principle '' report last month and describes him as a `` comprehensive review of the evidence . ''
But some researchers have called into question the reliability of the data , and highlighted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the `` extremely windy basis , '' based on the PHE its main conclusion .
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations `` on stone or sand build . ''
Martin McKee , professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . ''
They said that the public expects PHE 's claim that `` the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking '' on a detailed review of the evidence and the modelling .
In fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were summoned to a model of a multiple criteria and decision analysis ( Multi Criteria Decision Analysis ( MCDA ) to develop their opinions about the damage caused by various nicotine-containing products to lead to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report .
McKee and Cape , said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health , the managing director of British American Tobacco to previously means ( BAT ) to obtain an independent study .
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that funds from an e-cigarette-maker , but not the funding , according to reports by the tobacco company Philip Morris International is said to have received , she added .
The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel will not be delivered , but there are several popular e-cigarette champions , some of which is also an industry funding in the paper .
Some of the other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
At the meeting , also took the tobacco by PHE .
The research group `` significantly , '' admits that there is a lack of hard evidence , the damage of most products on most criteria , `` said McKee and Cape .
But none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report .
McKee and Cape , said that the allegations of PHE that `` there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes as a way to smoke for children or serve smokers '' were premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and wellbeing at PHE , said that it has responded to the allegations by BMJ earlier .
He said : `` E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . ''
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction .
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison , but that we still have to study the long term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows , and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from diseases related to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion a year .
The clear submission of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage that will be caused by smoking , and we meet our national competence .

Certainly , David Cameron The Lorax knows better ?
It is one thing to learn about all parents : If your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost by heart .
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
As a provider of childcare systems was asked , his favorite children 's book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax , published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. / .
It is a difficult choice , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company Super Camps , and continues : `` It was funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I read to my children , because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far . ''
All well and good , except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , but a summary of the film version of 2012 reflects the new characters and details added to the relatively short text .
`` In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where all the nature is gone , and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams to win by their desire to see a real tree , fulfilled , '' reads one , a love interest was Dr. / , whose real name was Theodor / hostage and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
As if that were n't suspicious enough : The text presented by Cameron sometimes reads like the summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database website will be presented and thus begins : `` In the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams of winning . ''
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron , the plot of the book is so little known , hears a unbenannter boy , as the local environment through the avaricious , trees cases , knitting Thneed Once-ler , despite the protests of the named Lorax , Hock , schnurrbärtigen , `` which speaks on behalf of the trees , '' will be devastated .
Most likely , it was such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper , The Lorax 20 times in a row is not a child read .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text of Cameron 's constituency office is likely to come .
Super Camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron 's employees , but had no further immediate comment .

The BBC should give up Eastenders , former head of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as Eastenders and The Voice . He said that commercial rivals `` would give their right arm '' for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that no other UK broadcasters .
He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , solid window against the most popular shows of their rivals and placing of channels such as BBC4 .
After the BBC director general , Tony Hall , said that the company in partnership with other organisations to do , Johnson said that he spent six years in his time at Channel 4 have tried , without success , to get in touch with the BBC .
`` I have a problem with the idea that the BBC has commissioned programmes or broadcasts , which also clearly not subsidized rivals would be shown , '' said Johnson , the House of Lords communications committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I think is not the medium or long term is a good idea , you should at least give its production to programs that others are doing or not .
Send The Voice in a prime time slot because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future .
The idea that no one else would show , this is a joke , it 's ridiculous , of course , it is nonsense .
Johnson said : `` I do not see why a regressive tax funding programs that could be financed without subsidies .
The Voice is such a programme , Eastenders is another , admittedly , both own productions .
To be honest , other channels would give their right arm for .
I try to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a serial entrepreneur , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for the pursuit of ratings , `` due to the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . ''
His comments on the BBC 's most popular shows are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , and in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like Eastenders .
Johnson said that the more public service niche programs `` to BBC4 should go where you can pretty much do not measure the audience , but they do their job , and they can argue when their hypocritical missions to justify a £4 billion broadcasting fees go , '' Well , of course , we have all these obscure programs that no one has seen. ``
Put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
The broadcasting fee , Johnson told the committee : `` I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from that .
Of course , they all think we all think that for £150 per year , here is a great value , but for people who have the £150 for a lot of money , whether that is true wonder , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to `` inform , educate and entertain . ''
He said very little about the BBC production would now officially classified as an education - he said that 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should be on the public television stations in Australia and Canada , take an example that change to `` inform , educate and entertain . ''
On the question of partnerships Elstein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , which he said that only a handful will be shown on television , and make alliances with commercial channels said to make everything available online .

B & Q boss says that the era of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen , Veronique Laury says
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has rise behind

Therefore , Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix shops for artisans and to close 60 B & Q stores .
Mrs Laury said she wanted more women in B & Q stores , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made by women in the shop .
At the moment , the men predominate among employees .
She said it was necessary to make the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past .
Mrs Laury said : `` There is still a majority of men in our stores .
We need to move it more towards a balance .
Basically , the half of our customers are women , with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
Women play a major role in the decision making .
Mrs Laury , one of only five women at the top of one of Britain 's leading companies listed in the FTSE100 index is also has its top team umstruktiert , an equal number of men and women in leadership positions to reflect .
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including its CEO and CFO .
Mrs Laury said : `` This was a deliberate decision - diversity is an important issue .
It was not difficult to find good women to our board .
Kingfisher announced a drop in half year profit and sales after the group schulterte the cost of closing the stores .
Because of the trend is Kingfisher , which owns B & Q and northern , 200 new stores .

Metcash Bodenständigkeits launches campaign to combat Aldi- invasion
Metcash tried to the IGA stores in front of an Aldi-gathering in South Australia and Western Australia .
Food wholesaler Metcash Bodenständigkeits has launched a campaign to get the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia on the eve of a $ 700 million to defend Aldi 's invasion .
While Aldi opening two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , is preparing to strengthen Metcash and IGA supermarkets , its relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA by mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adelaide show .
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo from Duns borough , which distributes samples in IGA stores and shopkeepers , cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League sell to loyal customers .
It is expected that Metcash further details of his defense strategy , published on 29 September , when the wholesaler for food , alcohol and sets its annual Investor Strategietag .
Much is at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia , nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA shops make up and higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states .
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states .
However , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi twelve months after opening its first markets will snatch away around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states and all existing players , but mainly independent retailers will take away sales .
A report published this week , the analyst Tom Kierath estimated by Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers $ 360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 , could lose .
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year , 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss in the food and grocery store and the amounts based on Metcash Metcashs high fixed costs around $ 13 million could profit before interest and taxes cost , Mr Kierath said .
At the same time , Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly in Aldi and Coles , although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund manager today Douglass , founder of Magellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade , Metcash .
Metcash refused to publicly respond to the comments made by Mr Douglass .
But there is an assumption that a member of Metcash has contacted Mr Douglass last week .
IGAS market share since 2010 , from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenue from Metcashs food and food trade , which supplies about 1,200-IGA retailers , has fallen by 43 % since 2012 , while the operational deleveraging pressure on sales and margins .
However , the wholesaler refuses and is investing more than $ 150 million to date with Coles and sale prices on hundreds of products every week level and IGA retailers to improve their stores by improving faster growing fresh food and a better selection of private-label foods .
Metcashs CEO Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store refurbishment programmes to drive up and hopes that the wholesaler in 2017 for the first time in four years , will return to profit growth .

Google Inc ( Googl ; O ) announced a Verdoppelungs-fundraising campaign that $ 11 million for humanitarian organisations have to help the thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations , from war torn and impoverished countries are fleeing .
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donations and call on his blog .

`` Our trip included too many dark rail and bus routes , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , '' she wrote .
I had luck .
But since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family , desperate for help .
The donations will go to four charities , aid to refugees and migrants to : Doctors Without Borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million to google.com / Refugee Relief doubled to $ 11 million .

Many people are fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends many thousands more to us , is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
Instead of helping in the camp Röszke immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly brought up the attitude of the Hungarian government into the orbit of Nazism .
Victim of this policy , not only those Austrians who are now faced with a chaotic situation in the border areas .
The disciplined will have to say that the `` promised land '' that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing more than another refugee camp .
It will be a major challenge , given the continuing influx of refugees and the onset of winter , with decent conditions for asylum seekers .
And it will be an even bigger - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .

BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , MP Andrew Bingham says
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its `` dumbing down . ''
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals .
He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that she only imitated The bathrooms smelt
Parliament 's colleague Damien Collins grabbed the show The Voice , and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 `` turns '' to Classic FM , a leading member of parliament and adds new pressure on the broadcaster claims to prove that he is doing something that does n't do the private broadcasters .
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the BBC bosses that public service radio station `` verdumme '' and increasingly no longer to distinguish from its commercial competitors .
`` Radio 3 seems - I use the word '' verdummen `` does not like - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , '' he said .
He was also on the BBC Music Awards , which launched last December .
The BBC Music Awards , which launched last year , seem to be The bathrooms smelt only under a different name .
So if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you really only `` imitate what is already on the market , said Mr Bingham .
BBC Director General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and educating the public .
What I learn from Radio 3 , which I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly unmatched .
`` And the commitment of Radio 3 , finding new music and new works , I think it is really important , '' he said .
At the beginning of this year , Radio 3 controller Alan facilities that needs to be worked harder to engage the audience argued the BBC than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
Radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , came under fire for its commercial rivals to the feet .
The Tory MP Damien Collins , The Voice - the musical talent show on the BBC , the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million has been purchased .
You can see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original , and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - `` in a special BBC way '' was produced .
He added that he hoped the company `` is a hit from our own stable '' when it run the next time an entertainment series .
However , he refused to the appointment of another series of The Voice in the future to exclude or bill payer 's money for other entertainment formats .

At its most anticipated meeting in Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot-Honduras mahogany table , to decide whether it is time for the first time in almost a decade to raise the federal funds rate .
Loom above them at one end of the ornate , two storey sitting room is a mural of the United States .
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues , the economic interests of the nation above all other things to do .
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : Maximizing the US employment and keep prices stable here .
But since the Great Recession , the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate : Financial stability .
And the third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them , it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to start , from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate close to zero since late 2008 to be weaned .
Although most of the economic data show that it is solid , the recent turmoil in global financial markets , the already cautious Fed officials are fearful that this volatility by increasing the interest rates on federal bonds to increase - and it is only about a quarter of a percentage point .
`` Obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they '' observe , Lindsey M. Piegza , Chefökonomin at the brokerage firm , said Stifel Nicolaus & Co .
`` But I think if they were looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate is not the increased uncertainty to wait around the global market enough justification to continue , '' she said .
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what confuses itself in the financial market .
About half of the economists who were recently surveyed by Bloomberg , have predicted a rate hike this week .
However , the financial markets are expecting the Fed wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
This points to a decline in the stock market , if the Fed raises rates , unless the strategists would soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far removed .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points , or 1.4 % to 16.599,85 .
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed 's policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed raise rates would be at this stage , `` he said .
If it does , `` they would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that they are not in panic . ''
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
Even a month ago , the Fed seemed to be well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US .
Yellen had in the spring and early summer , said that this year , despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be required to expect an increase in the rate .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labour market has been solid this year .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years , and close to the levels that the Fed considers full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And although inflation persistently below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed officials said that the main reason for the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
`` The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market , '' Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said .
But the financial markets around the world zuckten at the end of last month , after China had devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16 % below its record high , as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth .
The market has recovered slightly this month , while the Dow is now down by almost 10 % below the high in May .
Representatives for the Fed 's influence the market turbulence , the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates .
`` If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred , they would attract the reins at this meeting , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve .
Now he predicts that it will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , '' said Oliner .
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed , so technically it should not be involved in their decision making .
But in the end , the Fed has become the world 's monetary authority .
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
The mere mention of the former leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could narrow their monetary expansion , `` '' triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , from the Fed 's representatives can be expected to not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and expert advice to get a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision is `` more art than science , '' Zachary Kara Bell , head of global strategy , said of the asset management firm Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA. , said this month that the Fed `` a history of overreaction on financial market movements that do not seem to with the economic fundamentals are linked . ''
Lacker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is campaigning for a rate hike , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings , `` despite limited visible impact on growth in the US , '' Lacker said .
A year later , the Fed 's representatives made these cuts .
The Fed should only be aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis , such as the market collapse of 2008 first , Adam S. Posen , a former member of the committee , said the interest rate set by the Bank of England .
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level , he said .
`` They will certainly not get into the situation where they fear a rise in interest rates , because the markets are '' understandably upset , Poznan , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , said .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think that they should jump ahead of time .

`` Sono Genetics ' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves .
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that are too high for human hearing frequencies to be heard .
The impetus to work through the involvement of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves .
More on this subject : Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sono Genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to create a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , a researcher at the birth Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure will one day replace the deep-brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles .
The bubbles , he found that the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the worms .
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures that TRP-4 ion channels are called and in the cell membranes of some of the worms are found .
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned to , according to a report in Nature Communications .
In order to create ultrasonic controlled nematodes , genetically modified Chalasani the worms in such a way that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels .
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro vesicles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the revised motor neurons .
The procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics , a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to neurons with pulses of light on and off .
But Chalasani said that sono Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
In contrast to light in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain needs to be sent down to low frequency ultrasonic waves can freely pass through tissue and into the brain from the top of the skull .
`` We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible that the human neurons were temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments to make , '' said Chalasani .
Other applications could be to muscle cells and insulin-producing cells , he added .

Di Maria hits to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö .
Di Maria is making his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to cross in Malmö .
Here is the match report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course , as Paris Saint-Germain 's Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday .
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who the French champions on the road , but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61st minute , a Kopfballtor .
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions , because it is not only the qualification for the K.O.-Runden , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a great game by Laurent Blancs team with real Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate , and he was later in the game against his hometown team , and against the club with whom he made his illustrious career began back in 1999 , changed .
`` It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League , so it 's a good start to look back , 2 : 0 to win , and to cause problems to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we still '' in the course of the season to perfection , Blanc said .
`` It is a good sign .
We wanted to win and we have won , although I regret that we have not yet made one or two more goals. ``
Beckham , who returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which at the weekend with a 2 : 2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the league could hold , but he was in the fourth minute trumped by Di Maria .
The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man who PSG to the next level in Europe can take when he last month has been taken over by Manchester United , and he suggested that when he turned in Marco Erzähler pass behind the defence ran into Malmö University , before he passed to Johan Wiland nicely into the corner of the net .
However , if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory that was disappointed .
Malmö , Celtic beat in a play-off to reach this stage , came to national Anpiff with nine players on the field and was with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield strung a serious opponent .
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , who passed away in Kevin Trapps post in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PSG gave themselves sometimes , with some false passports and poor qualifications , not least from Inter , who was went on no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot .
Nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his players into the game and it was a pass from Inter , Di Maria turned into a spin shot by Wiland in the 52nd minute was diverted past the post .
The second goal finally came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani . The pampero scored his sixth Saisontor after Ibrahimovic a left flank of Maxwell had been exploited .
That ended any thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game , and only a superb intervention by Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz , the end result could be low , before substitute player was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end .
The coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , later announced that PSG was a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : `` Our last Champions League game was in December last year .
Since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level .
The qualifying games are not enough. ``
Hats off to Paris !
It was a great game of them !

Jeremy Corbyn 's debut at the Prime Minister 's Question Time
Since his election , Mr Corbyn 's debut is expected at the Prime Minister 's Question Time with tension
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to his debut in the Prime Minister 's Question Time and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Corbyn will rise up to the first of his six set points shortly after noon , with his performance probably by the media and the Labour MEPs from the subject .
He called for `` less theatre and more facts '' at this weekly event .
He also said that he might skip a few sessions to leave to colleagues .
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet , and after his speech at the Tuc-annual meeting on Tuesday .
In the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain to remain in silence , criticism from a number of Tory most provoked and is at the heart of several front page stories in newspapers .
Mr Corbyn 's decision not to sing the national anthem , has drawn attention to
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had `` stood in respectful silence , '' and he has acknowledged the `` heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . ''
But a member of Mr Corbyn 's shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told BBC Two 's Newsnight programme that he had come to the Labour leader , to sing the national anthem , `` independent '' from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused , Mr Corbyns top team to serve , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader .
The BBC 's political correspondent Robin 1988 says that political differences within Labour `` stack '' after Mr Corbyn 's remarks on the position of the European Union , and the reduction in profits .
Mr Corbyn said the Tuc conference that Labour amendments to present to the whole idea of a limit as a whole .
Hours later , said Mr. Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister , said that the party was `` very clear '' that she only against the government 's plans , the limit of £26,000 to £23,000 .
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , the Tory leader , since he is in the last decade at the Dispatch Box in the House , opposite .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says that he `` crowd sourced '' ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and he has more than 30,000 comments .
The Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister 's Question Time is too konfrontativ , and that he is `` both repartee and refrain from arguing with the barbs and instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business minister , will represent him , if he does not take part - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
He has also brought to the idea that other colleagues speak from time to time , and that he had referred to John Bercow , the Speaker of the House of Commons , to discuss the problem .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is from the policy in the style of a `` theatre '' to remove polls , which is often associated with the Prime Minister 's Question Time , but a few years later , he admitted that he had failed .
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as a key barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons , and his standing among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that she had become a caricature and in need of reform .

In addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards of accommodation as `` very high . ''
In the face of adversity , it could not be that service provider must comply with a certain amount of towel or the size of the skylights .
For a limited time would have to be `` emergency '' ARDS .
The fact that he , in contrast to the Home Office in the accommodation is more successful , Konrad establishes with his experience .
I am an elderly gentleman , which is not easy in the face of the untruth .
Persuasion is his main weapon .
Konrad and Maier does not cause the Republic costs , as she herself said .
They want to increase their number of employees to three or four .
Their own accommodation search was not yet successfully .
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Stephansplatz as an office .
But obviously , there are problems with the approval .

Prentiss was described by Shawn O 'Steen , who testified that they were married for about seven years , as a `` good man . ''
The two were divorced 15 years ago , but remained friends .

Knowles said that Prentiss , who owned a dog named Lightning met , for about three years with lamb .
`` They always wanted to help other people , '' said Knowles
The police said that lamb phoned relatives at one point on Monday to tell them , `` he will not go to jail . ''
When police heard him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot and ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb was in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University with a doctorate , as Lau tells his life on the website of the university .

Sports officials are also accused of financial crimes .
This fact , the chairman of the Schöffensenats , Judge Michaela Sanin from arbitration .
It is to be negotiated at a later date .
The Verwurf of infidelity , the defense stated that a fortune to be part of the club at any time .
Sports officials would only offset expenses and for the sports club , they have been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they have invested a lot of time and money , brought out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to approximately 600,000 Schilling ( approximately 44,000 euros ) .

With his colleague and co , he then decided to take on this task .
With all the risks .
`` We have vorgeschossen money , our life insurance as collateral in the bank , '' he said at the hearing .
With the club , you can manage the money freely , it may only be made no debts had been agreed .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : `` We create it . ''
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
What is in Germany ?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come after predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior to Germany this year , according to the Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD , Germany is even able to include a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : `` I say again and again : We can do this , and we do it . ''
What is in store for Germany , gives the following overview .
According to various estimates are needed between 350000 ( estimate by the German Federal Ministry ) and 400,000 ( estimate of Pestel Institute ) homes a year - and the next five years .
That is almost twice as much as previously ( 250000 homes will be built .
Dramatically , however , is the lack of housing , especially affordable rental properties : A year falling out 60,000 to 80000 social housing from the rental price fixing , and these attractive apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) intends to double the funding , currently 518 million to one billion euros .
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to occur every year , and the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year .
Scientists agree and federal construction minister is that it also needs to give more tax benefits for investment in housing .
According to estimates from the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the workforce in the long term can be disciplined in Germany .
However , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications , to help them start , criticises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation .
For the integration of refugees is crucial , however , whether they can find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the host society , but also the self esteem of immigrants , migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt says .
In Germany , there has been a political shift , according to Thränhardt : From the work ban for refugees on the recognition of work .
While there was a ban on asylum seekers in the past five years , it has been reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the duty of residence , limits the asylum seekers to a place of residence .
The company has the vision - also because of the resources - mostly enforced that refugees should be allowed faster access to the labour market .
A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of German .
So far , there is a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
In addition , studies show that most jobs are conveyed through personal contacts .
The construction of networks is therefore Thränhardt according to the royal road to integration work .
The Berlin school administration found that only a few station parents give their children to the care centres , it is estimated that 10 to 15 percent , `` for the displaced parents is very important to keep the family together , '' says Ilya Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department .
However , in order to convince the family from the benefits of Kita , the administration hand slip distributed in different languages .
The need for educators were to rise due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example , by allowing more schools .
In countries without the knowledge of German students in Welcome classes are prepared for the classroom .
But they are not always informed by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , including teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language .
There is no shortage of them , Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration says .
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle , no state asylum seekers or indulgent prohibits the study - the only exception in Berlin , Interior Senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has been abandoned , but now his attitude .
Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitated access to university .
For refugees with a residence permits or tolerance do not receive benefits under the current law , asylum seekers more if they begin a study .
The latter are basically not Bafög because they do not fall into the circle of people entitled to BAföG .
So far Belgium refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years , in order to be eligible Bafög- , from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months .
But even this funding gap needs to be closed , Steffen crash , Berlin 's state secretary for science , and the Deutsche Studentenwerk .
The students should immediately get Bafög .
Islam will play an important role in the future , because many of the refugees are Muslim , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
Islam , the state should grant the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state-church law to a new state-religion ratio .
Also important is the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association , who cares professionally for the new arrivals .
On the rights and obligations .
As the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas , and to give him some control .
This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Ayman Mazyek , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany .
Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany , `` immediately to their right , here , '' in Germany , forfeited , he said in the Bavarian broadcasting .
He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
Integration in the future will be much more than it is now a topic of the whole society .
The majority of society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and racism is pressing .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - less than a decade since an anti-discrimination and a general equality law .
But it learns very slowly , as the series showed the spirits of murder , the police and the authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
Equal opportunities for all : What migrants organizations and stakeholders not white German demand for a long time and commit what international agreements , such as the anti-racism convention , Germany , has to be a reality in the next few years , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
In general , Germany would be able to provide the expected refugees medically , doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says .
`` As far as a power and capacity , we create it , '' he told the Daily Mirror .
However , this extra money to flow into the system .
In order to avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery wants to hand over all arrivals on the registration health cards .
Services could be charged later with the Länder .
And , in the long term , it is highly questionable to toss as many people with limited service catalog , which stipulated the current law on asylum seekers .
Otherwise , the doctors are especially the language barriers .
In the past , the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are informed about their illness worse than other patients .
Not only in hospitals , including medical practices would have to be taken on interpreting costs , she says .
Many refugees would be helped but also with more general medical correspondents in the emergency ambulances .
And with another diagnostic view .
Among refugee children , for example , there are far more unprocessed disability , and young people go to HIV education .
With some of the other diseases , German doctors would come from their education , but clearly , Montgomery says .
`` Parasite infections or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize . '' And as far as the shortage of doctors , even relief may be in sight for the refugees .
The Syrians have a highly developed education system , many refugees are even doctors .
In order to be able to practice , but they would have to prove their qualifications and may drop again .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany , according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapy ( BPtK ) mentally ill : Most suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Munz , president of the BPtK .
A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany .
Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder , among other things , suffers from `` flashbacks with breathlessness , dizziness , palpitation and Todesängsten .
Other symptoms of sleep and concentration disorders , strong shock and emotional deafness .
In order to prevent the chronic symptoms would be an early treatment , Munz said .
So far , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy .
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services can make a request for a psychotherapy , but the process usually takes several months .
In addition , clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses were mostly in the social services , to decide whether or not a therapy is necessary .
This often leads to misjudgments , Munz says .

Why do I will be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
When it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will be in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State from 1929 , when Richard Glossip will be executed by lethal injection .
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
The invitation was back in January for the first time about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day approached , I began to fear me .
So , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would provide a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States , and since there are often more applicants than places available , a macabre lottery will take place to decide who will be elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
Whoever is selected , who will observe it dispassionately .
I can do that .
I will sit alongside Richard Glos IPS closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we are talking about .
The prison authorities say that I am not a witness and a journalist , so it will not be possible for me , a notebook and a pen to take to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality .
Here is the lesson .
Tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she had `` put it better , '' but she still thinks that it is wrong to what I do .
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
He tells me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
But he wants an international reporter is here to write there .
If he dies , he thinks that the publicity of the movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell , a reporter for the Huffington Post , will sit next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , you should hear a series of podcasts , which I have made .
I do not want to go back on all the details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed .
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from this perspective , I will see him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters to whom you can go for it .
What you will get from me , is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .

EU wants to limit mercury in predators double
The European Commission wants to double the levels of mercury in large predators and consumers expect a much higher dose of nerve gifts .
The consumer organisation Food Watch , which is a working paper by the EU , sharply criticised the plans : `` The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy with full force to pregnant women and infants passed , '' said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of the Watch .
Wolf Schmidt says that the limits of the nerve poison should be raised for big fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai- or swordfish for `` economic reasons '' from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
However , large predators are already burdened with so much mercury that around 50 percent of the catches are based on the current limits can not be sold .
Then , after doubling the limit only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable .
In return , the EU wants to tighten for this easing , according to food Watch the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
Food Watch described it as `` trick '' because smaller Fried fish such as carp are usually burdened so low that they already comply with the planned levels .
The reduction in small fish is `` a perfides diversionary tactic that helps the economy , '' said Wolf Schmidt .
Mercury for humans , a highly toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the food chain , especially in predators is strong .
Therefore , the federal government warns that `` even small amounts can cause great damage to the nervous system in the unborn . ''
The Federal Ministry for the Environment explains on its website regarding the current limits , however , that a `` health risks to the general population '' is not expected .
Mercury mainly by the coal combustion into the environment .
The German coal plants run according to a written report of the Federal Ministry for the Environment of the German Green MEP Anna Lena Baer Bock , more than six tons of mercury a year , two thirds of the total emitted in Germany .
The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was `` permanent and comprehensive '' mirror `` exceeded in March from the paper , '' quoted .
In the past year were European warnings about mercury in fish is already among the most common reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF .

And is doing well .
It is also registered starting in London , where the grandparents of the Immobilienmilliardärs Conservator .
The New Yorker with the hairdryer haircut has many in the village at the Wine Road .
Some of the 1200 inhabitants and is about dozens of corners is related to him .
His grandfather came from starting in the Palatinate : Donald Trump , here in campaign mode .
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel shot a film about Trump .
And what the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I think that somehow it is exciting , but are also impressed in their Kallstadter kind not so deeply , '' says Simone Wendel .
The native Kallstädterin has an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts , which in addition to Trump , the Heinz ketchup family .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , `` Kings of starting '' ( 2014 ) , so to speak - by saying that he would certainly be successful if he would live in starting .
The king of hearts , he has put it there .
Although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to be of the opinion that Trump was `` already a bit a big mouth , '' says Wendel .
Coincidentally , laute the nickname , the Kallstadt was in the vicinity , `` The Brulljesmacher '' - too high German : Angeber , she says .
So , Trump comes from the village of Angeber .
The Trump 's success story began in 1885 , when the grandfather immigrated to the United States and opened a restaurant for gold diggers .

But the lives of the grandparents was not without tragedy : Her desire to return to the country in the long term , the Bavarian state , which belonged to the Palatinate .
It took Trump because he had once hewn without permission , the director of the Institute for pfälzische history and folklore , Roland Paul , had declared the movie 's release .
Trump is the grandson of an `` illegal Auswanderers . ''
This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of the descendants .
He had repeatedly spoken contemptuously about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
`` Like the poltert , this is not so good , '' says Hans Bender , a distant cousin Trump ( `` The grandmother was a born Trump , the grandpa was born Heinz '' ) .
The retired vintner sees the Americans more aloof , `` he is always so is exciting . ''
Does he believe that Trump is coming ?
`` I can not imagine , '' says the 72 year-old .
`` He has never been about Kallstadt . ''
Guesthouse owner Veronika Schramm , like some Kallstadter mentions that a descendant of the family donated Heinz during a visit to the church organ , which was generally good .
`` I can not imagine me from the Donald , '' says the 68-year old .
You think it would be better for him if the election because `` have such radical views , I do not know if this is a good thing . ''
When those who were at the time of his grandfather in the United States , calling the shots , it would have been like him , `` he would never even got there . ''
`` There are '' more interesting topics than him , vintner 's daughter Sarah Bühler says .
And as the president ?
`` My president is '' it is not , she says .
And : `` The grapes are ripe , even without the President Trump . ''

The Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack to have a look
Wenger stressed to look that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan , there is no reason why he ca n't play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario is that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England , and given his history , his participation in next summer 's European Championship certainly still uncertain .
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then back to his old swing had found during the low season .
This kind of `` at risk of injury is not the career , '' Wenger said .
It is a bone that has not healed well .
This is not a major issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not in connection with his ankles , or with the injuries he had before .
That may be true from a purely medical point of view , but also , as Wenger acknowledged , there is the risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
It also develops an unpleasant pattern .
The investigation of Premier injuries Ltd has 23 different diseases of look since his debut six years ago .
He also played in just 65 of arsenal 157 league games in the last five seasons .
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs who have suffered the most damage .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season .
`` Sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and combat force , '' said Wenger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabilises , I am confident that he will do it and go through a career of the kind that he deserves .
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday , and Wenger is a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start .
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
`` I try to keep the balance and '' the players who need to take a little breather , Wenger said .
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress from Group F , the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidation effect in Europe .
Dynamo is unrivalled after 41 games , after the `` invincible '' campaign was launched in the last season .
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale .
This year , it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes that Arsenal , the lesson of the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco has taken and will continue to be driven by the distant hope , with his management of the club to its first UEFA Champions League triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '' Wenger said .
It has never worked at Arsenal .
In 2006 , we were very close , but on the other hand , I am in the business long enough to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .

While this brought the left side defenders cry and it will be ruled out for at least six months from the game , Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw can play again this season .
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Shaw in the PSV area had collapsed .
He was dealt with nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
Van Gaal said : `` He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital . ''
He will be published tomorrow , or perhaps a day later , and then operates in Manchester .
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then great , and then this happens .
In the dressing room , he had an oxygen mask on .
He wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fracture , it takes six months , and he will not play in the group stage .
I hope that he can play again this season .
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a Elfmeters .

Van Gaal assumed that the Italian referee was wrong .
You can judge for themselves when I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
It was a very serious attack with both feet .
A tweet on Shaw 's account was : `` Thank you all for your messages , words ca n't describe how broken I am , my road to recovery begins now , I come back stronger . ''

Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England 's team , but it is still difficult
On Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if the squad , which was selected for the tour of England , is a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat and not on my card .
I would not rule out a victory .
Alastair Cook 's side is probably less experienced than three years ago , but there are good spin-player in the Batting-list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear scars of 2012 , only a youthful positive attitude .
With the ball , Moeen Ali as a spin Bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , is an option for the attack .
Related news : Adam Lyth leaves England 's Test squad and will be replaced by Alex champions .
The decision to leave out Adam Lyth , of course , is to analyze me as his head coach in Yorkshire .
In his seven Tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results .
There were no question marks with Joe Root , for example , and that this led to the nomination - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser .
A long time ago , it would have extended the run of Lyth , but he had control over its own destiny .
Hopefully , if he beats out other runs for Yorkshire , another chance .
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even though he is not so good services , and it does not surprise me ; he is first and foremost a team man .
The question of how much time a test shot man gets to his character , is difficult .
Lyth had seven chances - such as Sam Robson got in front of him - while Nick Compton nine .
Compton was only got the chance to play home and away .
The only criticism I can make is that England was first used in the Caribbean - Jonathan routine when Lyth in top shape - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex champions comes in , and he is a hit man , whom I have high .
He is an X Factor cricketers what we saw Yorkshire early this season , when he 236 against us on the Trent Bridge pitch achieved what hit us .
He must be at least the same opportunities as those in front of him , but of course it depends on the team 's position in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of letting Moeen beat alongside Cook , with an extra-spin Bowler provide and would receive four Quicks , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a man ca n't go there , and that Hendrix has already shown that he is a devil guy of cricket players .
Moeen may have done his job for his county Worcestershire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is a big difference .
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an opener .
He has made three hundred runs immediately and never looked back .
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner , and in my limited dealings with him , he has really impressed me as a young man .
People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a punt , but there is a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the batsman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup .
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience , having played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood for the white ball phase of the tour , and brings energy and a strong commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was for the international cricket competition is created , as a player or as a coach , and how he has Mahela insights that we can benefit .
Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
Collys teammate in Durham , Ben Stokes , is not in the One Dayers , Root received a similar break against Australia and , for my part , I have no problem with that .
Some will not agree , but coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable .
And you have to remember that their jobs depend on the players from the results .
Such decisions are not with a light heart .

The Brexit camp ( Brexit = Britain 's exit from the EU ) could rise to win when the economy by the year 2017 gets into a slump
David Cameron 's crude Neuverhandlungs strategy to keep Britain in the EU , with each day deeper into trouble , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy `` Is it yes or no ? '' Corbyn as leader of Labour or the Tuc who are falling sharply due to Europe on Tuesday .
Foreigners also have their Corbyn 's and Nigel Farage 's .
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states , so deeply enmeshed in various crises , such as the EU , it is now time , and not always from their own guilt , Britain 's own agenda with divided concessions and disruptive changes that they often do not want to be satisfied .
In Brighton , the Tuc decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it when they threaten the social protection .
We could also have Dave and Georges Selfie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reform .
It is always about me .
My European friend who is an outside view of Britain inside the EU tent wishes - `` Let us not only with France , '' says Berlin - and hints that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals has come to the point where it is no matter to them , whether we stay or go .
Germany 's carefully measured Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but it has been 10 years in power , and the office wants to leave before it looks bad for them , as ausharrenden like Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 is the excessively long ) .
France 's François Hollande looks back on his reelection or his replacement in 2017 .
He is also a declining force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain is a left .
It is hard to imagine that they will get a leg bent to help the Selfie-British , whose energy should be used more , Scotland 's exit from the UK to prevent - something they may not want to , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
Therefore , possibly even planning some kind of ministers deliberately unhelpful comments , the SNP style , while Britain 's referendum campaign in 2017 , in order to speed up the Brexit process , my friend suspects .
`` The renegotiation was a bust , '' and `` Britain has won nothing of value out of the renegotiation . ''
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and the EU sceptics , the oligarchy of the press barons , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn were not , however , that our entry in 1973 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
You can be weak to Boris Johnson , the ore-euro opportunists , who has a reputation as a `` straight '' EU banana Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s , it has made .
For all its craziness Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies .
This included a medley of tax for fearing the rogue , phone hack of foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers .
Tony Blair actually thought much about it , but noted that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage , you better distributes bananas to distract him , rather than being on his lunch and dinner .
In fact , Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron 's referendum , because Blair had not adopted the principle of the EU constitution , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened the door for him .
The press has never forgiven him for that .
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave me on Monday in Westminster , a friendly pat on the back , I told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems in danger of Neil Kinnock 's boycott Murdoch 80 's strategy to repeat a mistake then and now .
It may be , but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew moroccan , whose BBC-sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyns official position on Europe - I express it nicely - in the development .
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
Well , most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye-trend and the wilder climes of Tories Klein Engländerismus everyone can say 'yes ' to do so .
It is to admit what Hilary Benn said , `` A , but not a Bennite '' Benn on radio and on television this week , when the Scout fought in it , not that provocative Corbyns appointment of John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 1970s , when his old father tried to do on television , disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without having to go too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hilarys fight was even more attractive .
But struggling to remain `` under any circumstances '' - Benns - was not what McDonnell said , nor what JC told his colleagues and MPs after all the reports on their conclave on Monday evening .
Whatever the consists bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even moved me - news discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock and , above all , in the maelstrom of social media , a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe , which allows him to Labour 's support in the referendum campaign as a matter of course , as McDonnell , it said .
Certainly Simon Jenkins thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguity to EU membership - in line with the Bennite Belagerungs economy , its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents , for whom the narcissism of small differences , a central principle of dogmatic disputes .
As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC is launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home .
Why Paris or Berlin should waste political capital - they have also distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British , if anything can be so pointless ?
The US is already pretty disappointed by the lack of military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction of the Tory government in power , which I start on Monday was reminded of something that is called British Influence Security Forum .

Now that Viktor Orbán several more thousand sends to us , is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
Instead of in the camp Röszke immediately to assist in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of Nazism .
Victims of this policy are not only those Austrians , who are now faced with chaos in the border areas .
The Geflüchtete will also have to conclude that the `` promised land '' that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp .
It will be a major challenge , given the continuing flow of refugees and the onset of winter , in decent conditions for asylum seekers .

Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching , when the US Federal Reserve in two days , Wednesday and Thursday , come together to make the important decision as to whether , for the first time in nearly a decade , the interest rate will be raised or not .
A survey of 80 economists , who were interviewed by Reuters , found that a little more than half , which only last week was of the view that the Fed will do this , now thinks that the Fed will still remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the present level of 0 - 0.25 percent .
It is a historic event , because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates to zero .
`` For the first time we are approaching a situation in which a major central bank may leave the zero area and starts the process of normalisation of interest rates , '' said Angel Ubide , senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The US economy is on a relatively good performance status , trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate a low inflation .
However , the Fed can not ignore the less rosy view of global relationships .
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the evidence suggests that the chances are good against such a move .
The decision will be announced at 8.00 p.m. CET on Thursday

Jeremy Corbyn 's debut at the Prime Minister 's Question Time
Since his election , Mr Corbyn 's debut with the Prime Minister 's Question Time awaits with anticipation
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is making his debut in the Prime Minister 's Question Time with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Corbyn will rise to the first of his six predetermined questions shortly after noon , and probably his performance by the media and the Labour MEPs will be examined closely .
He called for `` less theatrical and more facts on this weekly event . ''
He also said that he could skip some meetings in order to leave them to colleagues .
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn 's leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC 's annual conference on Tuesday .
In the meantime , the decision by the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a memorial ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , in silence , criticism from a number of Tory MPs has provoked and lies at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyn 's decision not to sing the national anthem , has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had `` stood in respectful silence , '' and he acknowledged the `` heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . ''
But a member of Mr. Corbyn 's shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader , to sing the national anthem , `` independent '' of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn 's top team , and they cite differences in economic , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader .
The BBC 's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences within Labour `` pile up '' after Mr Corbyn 's comments on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits .
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that presenting Labour amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap as a whole .
Hours later , said Mr. Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister , that the party was `` very clear '' that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £ 26000 to £ 23000 .
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he became Tory leader , in the last decade across the Dispatch Box in the House .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to policy , says that he has `` crowd-sourced '' ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and have given him more than 30000 comments .
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister 's Question Time is too confrontational , and that he is both `` repartee '' and refrain from the dispute with barbs and instead has to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business minister , will replace him when he is not taking part - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
He has also presented the idea that others sometimes take the floor , and that he was John Bercow , the Speaker of the House of Commons , raised , in order to discuss the problem .
In 2005 , when he was leader , Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the politics in the style of a `` Punchinello-Theater , '' which is often linked to the questions of the Prime Minister , but a few years later , he admitted that he had failed .
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time was seen with the Prime Minister as the main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , even though critics have argued that it is become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms .

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data takes a long time to show something , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert in the weight-loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery .
Weight-loss-surgery or obesity-surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
Over the years , obesity-surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proved effective , but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv .
Used for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng General Hospital data they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare the two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric sleeve education - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those who undergo this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
In the meantime , the BMI is among those who received non-surgical treatments for diabetes , roughly the same at 29 .
Among those who have undergone surgery , broke free at 36 % of the diabetes disease completely and at 28 % .
Sparked in the medically treated group compared to the diabetes fully only at 1 % and sometimes at only about two percent .
In addition , the results were at the controls of the blood pressure , triglycerides and `` bad '' LDL cholesterol , `` are generally better in the ' surgical ' group , '' the authors found .
The researchers also monitored the patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
After the operation , the average decreased hemoglobin A1c levels of around 9 per cent to around 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
But these `` better glycemic control '' - like you - reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels reduced the mortality rate in five years , then the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , had the bypass surgery group compared to the gastrectomy group lost more weight ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , achieved greater reductions in BMI ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and more experienced a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.9 % vs. 16.7 % ) .
While the new study of surgery , no survival advantage after five years shows that there is hard evidence from a study of people in Sweden , that operation leads to a longer life , says Blackstone , from the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix .
In the Swedish study , it was in obese people who undergo obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
Although the new study does not advantage for survival in the surgery patients showed , said Blackstone , it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process .
`` This is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , '' without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take seriously the weight as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30 .
`` I think that we have to wait long until we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have their bodies connected with obesity and diabetes , is really hard to reverse. ``

Four people , including a 4-year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of people who marched against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi , about 175 miles west of the capital , Katmandu .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , chief district officer , said that more than 1000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr. Dhakal said that the police had used tear gas and fired into the air before they returned to rubber bullets .
20 policemen and five civilians were injured , he said .
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber bullets , which are known , that they can kill , but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal 's southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces that are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution that would reduce their political influence .
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus , who want their own state .

The lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new Constitution could come into force on Sunday .

Brazil 's Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to educate women in a shocking way , about how important good nutrition while breastfeeding is . It is doing so with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck on her breasts , which are painted with images of unhealthy foods .
Breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates to give the babies all the nutrients they need in order to build a strong immune system .
Because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by about 500 calories per day .
However , new research suggests that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
A recent study led by Robert Waterland , a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
Unfortunately , an unhealthy diet can have a negative effect on the child 's immune system .

Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for the accommodation as `` very high . ''
In the face of adversity , it could not be that providers must adhere to a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the other spatial structures .
For a limited period of time , `` Notstandards '' would apply .
He was in contrast to the Ministry of Interior in the placement of successful Konrad , justified by his experience .
I am an older man , whom they say not immediately in the face of the untruth .

Experts criticize report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Allegations of a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , joined Lancet , by criticizing the evidence used in her report on e-cigarettes from Public Health England ( PHE ) .
PHE published the `` principle '' report last month , and describes him as `` a comprehensive review of the evidence . ''
But some researchers have questioned the strength of the data and pointed to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the basis of `` very windy , '' founded on the PHE his main conclusion .
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations are based on `` stone or sand . ''
Martin McKee , Professor of European Öffentlichde Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape Motherwell , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . ''
They said that the public expects that the assertion of PHE , that `` the current best estimate is that around 95 % of e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking , '' based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling .
In fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis ( Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA ) to guide their opinions about the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health , previously the managing director of British American Tobacco ( BAT ) have asked for an independent study .
He also signed the references of BAT in a sustainability report to public health , they said .
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that to receive funds from a e-cigarette manufacturers , but not the funding , which he previously reported to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not provided , but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions , some of which are also an industry funding provided in the paper .
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control .
At the meeting was also attended by the tobacco industry led by PHE .
The research work of the group `` significantly , '' admits that there is a lack of `` hard evidence of the damage of most products on most criteria , '' wrote McKee and Cape .
However , none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the PHE report .
McKee and Cape well said that the allegations of PHE that `` so far , there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers were '' premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and well-being at PHE , said that it was already responding to the claims of BMJ .
He said : `` e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . ''
One in two life-long smoker dies from his addiction .
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes , in comparison , are small , but we have to continue to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System £ 2 billion per year .
Through the clear presentation of the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national responsibility .

Peter Moody claimed that Steward tried to spy on him and threatened to quit the sport
Peter Moody claimed that Steward of Racing Victoria have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to quit the race immediately .
It was aimed at the Steward and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race day-treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what is best for the sport and he found himself in difficult conditions , when it came to the positive cobalt-swab sample in Lidaris , which he can not explain .
He had 18 months ago because of the spying allegations and did not want it `` look like high-hanging grapes . ''
`` I had nothing to say about this , and I have long been sitting on it , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , '' said Moody .
You know that it went further .
Sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
This evening , I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk around with your head , and I would like to see my owners think that I try my best for them .
If they start to think , I am not doing that , then I should no longer be coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
Previously , Moody had the bomb in an interview with state-racing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
`` Eighteen months ago , Terry Bailey sat , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart - in a room with a man - whom I shall name when I am asked and offered him a job in my stables for information about what I am doing in my stables to deliver , '' said Moody on Racing.com .
They seem to believe that I am a cheater .
If that is the case , they should certainly look at their noses because they have failed in an attempt to catch me .
Robert Roulston , former chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of RVL , were aware at the time and there are still today .
Should get me to believe that it will be personally ?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and maybe makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
I feel so bad for the industry ?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am there .
Perhaps they need to take my license and me , and I have no doubt that what I say , you can now think about it .
But I am now at a point where I do not care , and that makes me sad .
This makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The Frustrations-levels of coaches have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation in Lidari , and the late scratching meant that he said that he could `` throw his license on the table . ''
Moody , best known for his preparation for the unbeaten champion Black Caviar , described the race day-treatment rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horses legs , which contravened the rules .
`` It is against the rules of racing .
I must take full responsibility for this , `` he said .
`` One of my employees has mistakenly sprayed slurry on the leg .
It could have been yesterday evening .
It could have been all day yesterday , so what was the case .
It was also on the day of the race .
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the day of the race , an investigation of this matter was opened .
It is a joke .
People who set these rules , know nothing about the horse .
`` We all recognize that we need rules , but here , it is gone too far , '' said Moody .

`` So it goes no further , we must attend to the causes , '' said the Free voters head .
Deported asylum seekers want to deport the Free voters as soon as possible .

Exceptions to the new Bernrieder sports hall
The Bernried council approved the Bauantrag for EUR 2.3 million in expensive sports hall .
And he made an exception .
The roof should be flat for the solar system .
The plans for the long-awaited Turnhallenbau on Bernrieder sports grounds are progressing step by step : in the recent City Council meeting , unanimously approved the draft Bauantrag without much debate .
Previously , the board decided , among other things , a request for a baugesetzliche `` exception '' or `` liberation '' from the current construction plan .
The `` exception '' dealt with the permission of a special form on the roof structure .
According to a `` roof with non-modified First and roof survives . ''
Background of the planning is the proper use of the roof space for solar panels : `` we have a wonderful big Süddach together , '' mayor Josef Steinberger said in the meeting .
The `` liberation '' , in turn , went to the roof slope , which - unlike in the construction plan prescribed for energy reasons - is less than 10 degrees .
The volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
A `` liberation '' was necessary because the construction plan on the roof slope does not allow for `` exceptions '' - and the Bernrieder council in the more restrictive rules on exemption requests .
In the Turnhallenbau , however , it is not a recurring project : `` we do not create a precedent , '' said Steinberger .
The Turnhallenbau at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried .
Costs are around 2.3 million euros .
Grants are expected to come from the school and grassroots sports funding .
In the next procedural step , the Bauantrag will now be submitted to the local Health Authority for consideration for the Hall 18 x 36 metres wide .

Robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
Germany is supposed to be following the will of the federal government to change the car a technological pioneer .
The German cabinet on Wednesday decided a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which , among other things , provides for investment in digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the fringes of the IAA auto show of a `` new era of mobility . ''
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less congestion , said Dobrindt .
He wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries , including at the IAA , along with representatives of the industry .
The strategy document of the Transport Ministry , among others , stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio .
The new technique is currently testing a test track on the Highway 9 in Bavaria .
So the driver will be saddled with `` no additional liability risks , '' the federal government wants to review the legal framework `` and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . ''
Thus , Germany , for example , international efforts to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10 % to 130 miles per hour .
The federal government also wants to push for a revision of the Vienna Convention , which so far includes only the people as a driver .
The automated driving leadership is increasingly the car , the driver is turning more and more to the passenger .
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which record the environment and process the data in seconds .
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on highways by 2020 will be technically possible .
Nevertheless , be driverless vehicles on public roads `` until well after 2020 . ''
The added value in terms of driver assistance systems and the high value of automated equipment in Germany , the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion .
`` The digital network of cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency on the road , '' said the SPD politician Transport Sören Bartol .
The question of liability in case of an accident and the safety of the personal data of the driver but clearly needs to be clarified .
Even the Germans , however , see self-driving cars - much more skeptically than French or American .
A survey presented on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be travelling in the next ten years , 32 percent expect in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe this .
In France , 21 % of respondents expect to 2025 with autonomous driving cars , 33 % in the US .
In any case , the car drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle .
According to a survey of the association Bitkom Digital would agree to only seven percent of the control over the entire ride on all roads .
On the motorway could imagine the traffic flowing as much as 15 percent , 45 percent in the closet .
Well one in four people would be left to the car 's control under any circumstances .

This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
A rate increase is coming , and the bull market will falter , yields on bonds will rise and the economy will slide into a recession .
We know that .
What we do not know is how long all this and how long it will continue .
In particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the end .
A recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months .
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how to respond to the economy and the financial assets .
Therefore , representatives of the Federal Reserve have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather on the period that is necessary for the normalization .
In fact , several variables play a role .
At the end of the market participants , however , may find that the outburst may have been exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates .
`` The first increase by the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of '' cheap money `` , '' said Julian Jessop , chief economist at Capital Economics , in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still at a low level , in order to lead to a seismic shock that many appear to fear .
However , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
Here is a look at historical trends based on how some parts of the economy could respond :
As the market has seen in the last month , the anticipation of interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
Once the increase , the impact is not so dramatic .
`` It seems to me that there is a tendency that asset returns will choke off 12 to 24 months after the first hike , which perhaps reflects the delay in the monetary policy , '' said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens to interest rate hikes by the Fed .
More specifically , the market is pretty flat over the past 35 years , mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest rates , then the 250 days ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average rate of return over the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent , according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll , chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , in Barron 's .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stock tends to occur later in the cycle and increase the rate of return that is beginning to decrease .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often encourage them .
In the current case , the Fed is faced with a number of conditions , which did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
Most remarkable is that the GDP will be close to its lowest point in a Fed rate hike .
According to Deutsche Bank was among the 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950 , the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect that this will continue and we expect for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed , only 1.5 percent .
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of whether `` this time it is different , '' said Deutsche Bank .
Participants in the market throughout the year have been caught on a Fed rate hike , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC might approve an increase in this session , futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
`` In our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in terms of GDP and the pre-recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shadows , '' says the report .
In contrast , this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
The fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticipates a rate increase , and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market .
The main difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in stocks , though the change its strategic direction .
The returns on bonds seem to change direction , as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle .
At the end of the cycle , increasing bond yields will fall immediately , said Deutsche Bank .
The strategists of Charles Schwab , believe that the increase in interest rates will mean that yields between longer and shorter bonds closer to one another and lead to a tailing off of the curve .
High-yielding bonds often yield better returns , even though `` we still are cautious to expect higher returns in such a climate , '' said Kathy Jones , fixed-income analyst at Schwab , in an analysis .
It is interesting that Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , '' she wrote .
Short-term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flatter , credit spreads have widened , and the volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market , when the Fed tightened its strategy .
By and large , companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US , stands to benefit if interest rates rise and local products will become more attractive .
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off , because a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of its debt .
`` History shows that the '' quality `` stocks tend to respond very positively , three months after an initial increase in interest rates , '' Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the client .
Companies with strong balance-sheet companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 exceeded an average of 5 percentage points .
Companies with high capital returns and lower volatility in their stocks outperform their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debt is a big problem .
Companies with a high degree of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Goldman .
Outside of the pure stock of games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
Savers could see profits through higher yields , even though experts are divided on how quickly this will take place .

FedEx earnings mixed financial-reduced prospects for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter , and the shipping giant lowered its profit outlook for an entire year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service .
The company also said that it plans to hire roughly 55000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
At this point last year , FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
The shares fell more than 2.5 percent in the Premarket trading 45 minutes prior to the opening on Wednesday .
FedEx Corp. said , to earn a profit of between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 $ for the fiscal year , which ends next May , 20 cents less than the previous forecast .
Analysts expected , according to a poll by FactSet 10.84 $ .
The reduction comes despite the prospect of price increases , which amount to an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages , which are collected from November .
The company said that it expects that earnings over the previous year because of cost-cutting , higher revenue and because of the growth in online trade will increase .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides `` solid returns , given the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . ''
The plans for the holiday jobs were announced a day later than those of rival UPS , which plans to hire between 90000 and 95000 more workers , roughly the same number as last year .
In the quarter , which ended on August 31 , FedEx earned $ 692 million , 6 percent more than last year .
Earnings per share amounted to 2.42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.44 $ per share , the twelve inquired of Zacks Investment Research analysts predicted .
Revenue rose 5 percent to $ 12.3 billion .
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $ 12.23 billion .
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years , the turnover in its express delivery unit brought to stagnate .
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground .
In the last quarter , revenue at the ground transportation by 29 percent , but operating income was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance .
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
In the Premarket trading , about an hour before the opening , FedEx shares fell 3.85 , or $ 2.5 percent , to 150.15 $ .
On Tuesday , they closed with a loss of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .

Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England 's squad , but it is still difficult to
In the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan , is a difficult task , but if you have selected the squad , England for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not rule out an away victory .
Alastair Cook 's side is probably less than three years ago , but there are good players of spin in the batting position , and the community spirit is strong ; they will bear no scars of 2012 , only a youthful , positive attitude .
With the ball develops Moeen Ali as a spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
This related news : Adam Lyth leaves the England test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales .
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is , of course , for me , as his head coach , in Yorkshire , and difficult to analyse .
In his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results .
There was no question mark when Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nomination , because - and I have said this earlier - players are their own best chooser .
Long ago we could have extended the run of Lyth , but he had control over his own destiny .
Hopefully , if he beats out other runs for Yorkshire , comes another chance .
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even if it is not so good services rendered , and it does not surprise me ; above all , he is a team man .
The question of how much time a test-shot man gets to put his characters is difficult .
Lyth had seven opportunities - such as Sam Robson - in front of him , while Nick Compton got nine .
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away .
The only criticism one can gather , was that England was Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean began - as Lyth in top shape - but that lost opportunity now lies in the past .
Alex Hales comes in , and he is a man who shot , which I appreciate .
He is an X-factor-cricket players , what we saw in Yorkshire early this season , when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge Square , which hit us very much .
He must be at least given the same opportunities as those in front of him , but , of course , this depends on the team in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of Moeen in addition to Cook , which would receive an extra spin Bowler and four Quicks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a man ca n't beat , and this left-handed has already shown that he is a hell of a guy of cricket players .
Moeen has perhaps done his job for his county Worcestershire , but he is not a number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
My former teammate Justin Langer played in his first 38 tests at first drop , before he emerged in 2001 as an opener .
He has managed three hundred runs straight away and not looked back .
Zafar Ansari is in the squad as a back-up spinner , and he has impressed me as a young man in my limited dealings with him .
People may see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a punt , but there is no large number of backup spinner who raise their hands , and the coaches have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the batsman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the trial games could be a champion .
He is one of the nicest guys in the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , because he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood is coming to the white ball-stage of the Tour and brings energy and a strong commitment to the environment .
I have always felt that he is created for international cricket competition as a player or a coach , and how Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from .
Sometimes , new voices in the dressing room bring a breath of fresh air , even if the messages are consistent with the above .
Collys teammate in Durham , Ben Stokes , is used in the One-Dayers , Root received a similar break against Australia and , for my part , I have no problem with that .
Some people will not agree , but coaches and Teamaufsteller do not determine the timetable .
And you must bear in mind that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
Such decisions are taken not blithely .

Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and the opinion of the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly described as `` special K , '' the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters spotlight .
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterwards had Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison divorced twice by the referee , with Harrison exclaim : `` Wawrinka should have Kyrgios beat , and I should beat the child . ''
While he was last seen , as he smashed a tennis racket , after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Groth in the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain .
`` One thing that I am pretty ereifere is the fact that , in my view , Thanasi a little was dragged into the dispute , '' said Healy .
He has broken a racquet when he lost because of a cramp in the U.S. Open , but he is not the first player who broke a racquet in frustration with himself , and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , really , he is in the US Open has behaved extremely well , even among the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves much credit .
He has a great team around them , he has a great family around them , and I believe that he was a little harsh .
He is a very mature 19-year-old , he is working very hard , and he fits into the team , and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in Umkleidebereich , he trained hard , he is in good shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be on its own merits .
Healy also supported the decision , Kyrgios in failing to take into account the important qualifiers , which starts on Friday , and he describes the `` joint decision `` as a right for all , but he assures the man from Canberra , to return as a long-term is an integral part of the team. ``
`` First , we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not at all the controversy around it [ Kyrgios ] , '' said Healy .
And I believe that Nick has risen quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , he is rising in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives , but we try to support him , we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time outside of the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him .

Serbians with a $ 200000 bail after drug charge
A man who may be a life sentence because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to Queensland , was released on bail of $ 200000 .
Marko Maksimovic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police 100 kg of the drug was on the yacht Solay , which came from South America across Vanuatu and in August in Coomera .
Maksimovic was observed how he met his co in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse , where police seized 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine , the lawyer of Maksimovic , argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the whole lot and that may have been in the cafe of a benign reason .
The judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flanagan , was concerned about the risk of absconding in Maksimovic .
He has clear ties to Serbia .
He often travels to Serbia , `` he told the court on Wednesday .
In the criminal case , he had lied to police about his whereabouts .
Maksimovics mother and stepfather had jointly offered a deposit of $ 200000 as a security in order to achieve his release .
`` After reading the statutory declaration statements of the two people , it is clear that the imposition of a security of $ 200000 a real financial burden , '' said Judge Flanagan .
But that alone will not be enough to stop him , not to appear , he warned .
Maksimovic was released on bail , under the conditions that he will make his Australian and his Serbian passport , is reported to the police daily and abide by a curfew from 18 : 00 until 06 : 00 .

Croatia : `` we let the refugees '
`` Now the border controls at our southern border , '' said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner .
The controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
Was it clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum , `` this could , of course . ''
The care and safety of the people standing in the foreground .
But it is also clear that `` we need clear signals , '' said the minister .
The people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration , not even on the Austrian-Slovenian border .
It takes a controlled approach .
Croatia , Slovenia is considering `` corridor '' - denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to allow incoming refugees to travel further in the direction of Austria and Germany and possibly create corridors for the refugees .
Just saw this Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana , though .
The idea of corridors is `` absolutely unacceptable , '' Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary .
The border with Croatia , however , is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
As the Minister emphasised , Slovenia wants to seal its borders to refugees .
`` Every EU member must complete its obligations , otherwise the system would not work , '' said Györkös Znidar .
As the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried during the night hours on Tuesday , entering the Eastern border crossing Tovarnik/sid to evade the registration .
The Croatian police could pick up in the nearby corn fields .
According to local media ever since meeting in the Croatian Tovarnik constantly police vehicles with new refugees .
It was mainly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
Also , rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
Expect in the coming days , his country , with around 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic .
Moreover , buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border , which had hitherto brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would be redirected towards Croatia , Croatian and Serb told media on Wednesday .
The government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to advise the people to take certain routes : `` neither we , nor do we want to do this , '' it said .
According to media reports , at least in the morning a first bus carrying around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid , in the course of the day , other coaches would be expected .
On Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling all night from the Macedonian border , some 500 km away from Serbia .
`` We have heard that Hungary has closed down , so we told the police that we have to come here , '' said one of the refugees .
They wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
So that it could actually get to the observers already predicted shift in the current Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a stretch a little further to the west .
Croatia : `` comprehensive ways to border control ''
Croatia 's Minister of Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the case of a large influx of refugees on plans for possible emergency situations .
He mentioned details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non-Schengen member `` comprehensive options for border control . ''
Consider strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia is one of this since 2007 , the EU 's partner since the country is consistently a testimonial as to the standard of border controls .
On the Serb side , behind the Hungarian border fence remains around 300 refugees .
According to Belgrade media reports they had spent the previous night at the border Horgos to Röszke .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked .
Whether the remaining refugees now want to continue to travel to the Croatian border , is still unclear .
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to reassure Mittwochfrüh for a look at what is happening in Horgos : he does not think that the debates on alternative routes for refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , is premature .
Currently , it would not be very large numbers of refugees .
They could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
Rates of immigrant workers to dangerous - alternative routes -
However , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees , where alternative routes are drawn in through Croatia .
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia , however , is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the war , Croatia still not cleared minefields .
On Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers was sent into the border region .

In an emergency , Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency , Professor Shannon Lamb told a somewhat tremulous voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb , it was important to stress that his `` cute dog '' but still live and was probably excited , and he said that the families of the dead woman contacts could be found on the phone .
Inside the house , the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss , a handwritten note that was scrawled on a white block : `` I am sorry , I wish I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . '' This was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
There was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , has already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed , according to the police , a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn said that his university employees the shooting heard at 10 : 18 pm .
He said that Lamb made the fateful call at some point after that .
By the end of the day , there was another death : lamb committed suicide when police surrounded him .
A day after the shootings at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
The details released by investigators on both ends of the state , as well as what the students and staff who knew him testify , helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
Students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
The police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt 's Lamb himself had mentioned in a book written by him , in which he spoke of the `` beautiful people '' with whom he shared his academic life .
Both teach in the department of social sciences and history , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended classes from both .
At the same time , there were some inclines to problematic behaviors .
A student , Brandon Beavers , praised the Lamb , said he seemed a little too excited and nervous , `` as if something was wrong with him . ''
Another student , Mikel Sykes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15 .
Lamb had previously at Delta State University asked for a leave for medical reasons and said that he had any health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
Recent changes in the employment policies of the university meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not guarantee an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor .
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course , there was something in Mr. Lambs notion . ''
These are questions that can no longer reply to lamb .
After fleeing the campus police found the Lambs later track , when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be arrested Lamb , killed himself selbstmit a d caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents ' house on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said .
His car was still in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3500 students in a city with about 12000 inhabitants , and taught geography and pedagogy .
He received his doctorate in spring in pedagogy .
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when she met through common friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who a few years tried to teach her to play the guitar .
He was the crowd of women .
All the girls melt away when he was there , `` said Hairston , now 40 and living in the suburb of Jackson , Brandon .
Lamb and Prentiss were obvious for some time .
The emergency call Lamb said : `` I have killed my wife , '' but there was no certificate of marriage .
They had a dog named Lightning , who lived with them in the brick house , which shares a border with a Bayou in Gautier .
The police said that the dog was in order .
The ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn O ' Steen , said that they had been divorced 15 years ago , but had remained friends and had a daughter , who was 19 years old .
`` She was totally devastated , '' said O ' Steen about his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O ' Steen said he had never met , but Lamb by his daughter , Abigail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb hit Prentiss , when he and Abigail three years ago at a summer-year market .
They later played together one or two gigs .
O ' Steen , said his daughter , sings and writes her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a low-lit bar near Gautier , said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 , the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and Mundharmonikaspiel finished a meager audience .
There were no signs that anything was wrong .
`` Just a happy couple , '' he said .
We were in the clean up and joked with each other .
I think they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , a dead professor , headed the first-year seminar program , specializing in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three small children .

Why I am going to be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
If it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spectator 's gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State penitentiary , when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection .
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses for his death .
The invitation was made in January for the first time about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed to .
As the day approached , I began to worry me .
So , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would provide a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US , and there are often more applications than places available , a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
Whoever is selected , it will be the unemotional .
I ca n't .
I will sit next to Richard Glossips closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half-hour visit .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we are talking about .
The prison authorities say that , I ca n't be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to carry a notebook and a pencil to record what I see .
I simply must try to remember all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter , my impartiality .
Here is the lesson .
You tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you get access to it .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she `` would have put it better , '' but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
He tells me not to write what I did , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from their list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants to write that one international reporter was present .
When he dies , he thinks that the public will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell , a reporter of the Huffington Post , will sit next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts , which I have made .
I do not want to go back to all the details .
I ca n't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the crime .
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I feel sure that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from this perspective , I will see him die .
I ca n't really claim to be objective .
There will be other reporters who can write .
What you will get from me , is what it is like to see a man die a needless death .

The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are pretenders .
This option also connects with some billionaire who wants to become US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for Aufreger .
Whether he is xenophobic , male journalists or gaps in their knowledge of the international crisis policy revealed - the candidate for the US presidency swirled vigorously on the election campaign .
And performs well here .
This will be recorded in the Palatinate Kallstadt , where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire .
The New York City with the Föhnfrisur is many in the village of winemakers on the Wine Route .
Some of the 1200 people on the ground - dozens of corners is related to him .
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in Pfalzen : Donald Trump , here in the campaign mode .
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel on Trump .
And what the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I think that is the kind of exciting , but also in its Kallstadter kind not so deeply impressed , '' says Simone Wendel .
The native Kallstädterin has filmed a humorous documentary about the town and its famous offspring , including next to Trump , the Heinz ketchup family .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , is in `` kings of Kallstadt '' ( 2014 ) , so to speak - by saying that he would also be successful if he would live in Kallstadt .
The king of hearts , he has not brought it there .
While there is respect for the power of the family , but also tend to be of the opinion that Trump is `` a bit of a big mouth , '' said Wendel .
Strangely enough , the noisy nickname , Kallstadt in the vicinity , `` the Brulljesmacher '' - to high English : the show , she says .
So Trump comes from the village of pretenders .
The Trump 's success story began in 1885 , when the grandfather and later opened a restaurant for gold rush in the US .
Foundation stone of the real estate company was the first piece of land purchases in New York .
But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy : their desire to return permanently to the home failed , the Bavarian state , which then belonged to the Pfalz .
He did not include Trump , because he once was hewn down without permission , the director of the Institute for Palatinate history and folklore , Roland Paul , had declared the movie to start .
He is the grandson of an ' illegal immigrant ' .
This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of the offspring .
Had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants .
`` As the noise , it is not so appealing , '' says Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant cousin Trump ( `` Grandma was a born Trump , Grandpa was born Heinz '' ) .
The retired vintner sees the Americans rather aloof , `` he is always so effervescent . ''
Does he think that Trump is ?
`` I ca n't imagine , '' says the 72-year-old girl .
`` He has never taken care of Kallstadt . ''
The Pensionswirtin Veronika Schramm mentioned how many Kallstadter , a descendant of the Heinz family during a visit to the church organ donated what was generally a good thing .
`` I ca n't imagine the Donald , '' says the 68-year-old girl .
You think it would be better if he did not win the election , because `` such radical views , I do not know if that is good . ''
If those who had been at the time of his grandfather in the US calling the shots , as he had , `` he would never arrived there . ''
`` There are interesting issues than him , '' says vintner daughter Sarah Bühler .
And as a President ?
It is not `` my president , '' she says .
And : `` the grapes are ripe , '' without the President Trump .
Wendel Film , was interviewed for the Trump , have long seen 12000 Kinogänger , even in the US is stirring the interest .

Luke Shaw of Manchester United ca n't play for months because of double-fracture
Luke Shaw suffered in the Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven Manchester a double fracture of his right leg .
While this brought the left-side defenders cry and will preclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Gaal is not in the hope that Shaw can play again this season .
The breach was caused by a reckless attack by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area .
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
Van Gaal said : `` he has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital . ''
He will be tomorrow , or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it is very difficult and it is fantastic , and then this happens .
In the dressing room , he had an oxygen mask on .
He wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fracture , it takes six months , and he will not play in the group stage .
I hope that he can play again this season .
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee has not punished , the Mexicans .
Van Gaal conjectured that the Italian referee had got it wrong .
You can judge for themselves , when I say that were a penalty and a red card .
It was a very serious attack with both feet .
A tweet on Shaw 's account was : `` I would like to thank you all for your news . Words can not describe how I am broke , my road to recovery begins now , I will come back stronger . ''
Referring to this : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The England defender has been with the European Championships in France an extra incentive to recover until next June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV coach said : `` it is a very serious violation . ''
If a player with that kind of injury leaves the place , are all very sad .
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent .
Moreno suffered a leg fracture , when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 .
`` It is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and then , when you hear that it is a very serious injury , that is not good , '' said Cocu .
For me , it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction , so that it looked as if he [ Moreno ] had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
In conversation with Moreno SBS6 said : `` I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be anything .
I feel very bad . I am so sorry .
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling .

Seven 's Sunrise dominated the ratings , despite the attempts by Nine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rushed to Canberra to report following the loss of the leadership of the Liberals , but it has no major shifts in the ratings for Today .
The breakfast show from Nine was broadcast by the nation 's capital , when Malcolm Turnbull made the overthrow of Tony Abbott .
The rival Sunrise , with presenters David Koch and Samantha Army days , stuck in London as part of a weeklong series of international television broadcasts , including Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
The disadvantage of the distance seemed for Australian TV viewers to play a role , as Sunrise 397000 viewers , on average , scored in the five capital cities , compared to Today 339000 .
Today posted a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 317000 ) and last Tuesday ( 283000 ) , but his numbers fell short of last Thursday ( 343000 ) .
Today in recent months has closed the gap with Sunrise .
In August , Today averaged 318000 compared to 330000 of Sunrise .
At the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40000 and 50000 .
So far in September , Sunrise averaged 349000 viewers to 314000 in Today .
This is the most interesting what happens every morning .
The winds of change this morning affect more people than the Parliament .
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review .

The result of last night answered it with a clear `` yes . ''
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block ( 838000 ) and TBL Families ( 726000 ) .
Seven had mixed results in two evenings of The Chase Australia .
The first half-hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , moderated by Andrew O 'Keefe showed , on average , 446000 viewers .
The second half-hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 623000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat ( 613000 ) .
On Monday evening , the first half-hour of The Chase Australia 520000 viewers and in the second half-hour whopping 720000 .
Hot Seat averaged 620000 .
The decline in the prices of the second night of The Chase Australia is confident that Nine Hot Seat will ultimately prevail by 17 : 30 .

Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany , Austria has also re-introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
The Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told Austrian television ORF on Tuesday evening , after Hungary will now also no one sent back .
Germany also had no refugees sent back to Austria .
`` No , that is agreed upon , '' she said .
On the question of an agreement , after the Germany could absorb a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mikl-Leitner , there have already been talks on this matter between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
Calling them concrete figures and drew attention to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
In the past few days tens of thousands of refugees had come through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
Their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and their Austrian colleague , Werner requested Mr Faymann , together with several other EU leaders hold a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun with a temporary border on Sunday .
The EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of a further 120000 refugees next Tuesday ( September 22 ) at a special meeting .
Given the strength of refugee status in Germany , wants to give more support to the federal countries during the reception and distribution of the people .
The covenant will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced late on Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of meetings with the prime minister in the chancellery in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection , too , would get it .
Those who do not have home perspective , but also could not remain in Germany .
This view was shared in the most impressive round .
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a `` huge effort '' .
Thousands of desperate refugees are now on the Balkan route .
Hungary had on the night of Tuesday closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia .

Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a combination of a major fashion show and a Jubilee-shop of horrors : the designer Jean Paul Gaultier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition of his work on Wednesday in Munich .
Highlights : the mannequins , with video projections look frighteningly human .
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others , with Madonna 's stage Nout fits the big star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in skirts .
`` Today I ca n't say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture , because I have white hair . ''
`` It used to be white , but in the meantime it is genuine , '' said Gaultier .
For visitors to the exhibition `` from The Side Walk To The Catwalk '' ( From the sidewalk to the catwalk ) , which has changed from 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designers of his initial opposition to an actor about his person .
In fact he was against it , because : `` for me a exhibition sounded a bit after death , '' he said .
When one dies , you will come to the museum .
The impressive collection was made previously in Montreal , Canada , and in Paris .
`` It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes , '' said the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Diederen .
It is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhibits give an insight into the varied range of works of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training program .
Chronologically , the exhibition has not been built , but it is a brilliantly choreographed total work of art , for which a great deal of effort : to cook the doll , for example , has been specially hired a stylist .
14 tons of material were dumped after Munich , according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot , the doer .
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest was a very special theme : a leather-pants outfit with a corset .
Heidi meets Madonna .
He was always interested in strong women ( `` women are smarter than men '' ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaultier .
Also rode horses old Teddy is seen in the exhibition .
It represents the first , tentative steps towards fashion designer .
As a child ( he was not a good student and bad ) in football , he had drawn his teddy bras and dresses , Gaultier said .
To play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
The design of fashion he had later become self-inflicted .
He stole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gaultier recounted in Munich .
Later on I bought but then of course .
For his first fashion show , he was not able to pay for the models .
They got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .

' Sonogenetics ' brain cells can be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically-modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by bursts of sound waves .
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment , in which they are irradiated with sonic pulses for human hearing at high frequencies , in order to be heard .
The impetus to work through the activation of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which react to ultrasonic waves .
Read more on this subject : the research and writing brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worm showed the power of a new procedure , called Sonogenetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep-brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles .
The blisters , he found , increase the ultrasonic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
The enhanced ultrasound waves on structures , the TRP-4 called ion channels , and found some of the worms in the cell membranes .
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , as a report in Nature Communications .
In order to create ultrasound-guided nematodes , genetically-modified Chalasani wear the worms so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels .
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are amplified by the Mikrobläschen and transferred to the worms , where they switch on the modified motor neurons .
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics , a cutting-edge tool that allows scientists to neurons with pulses of light and off .
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technology .
In contrast to the light that revealed in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain has to be low-frequency ultrasound waves unimpeded tissue and can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull .
`` We believe that with therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to make the angezielt human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , '' said Chalasani .
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells , he added .

DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees from until 2019 , the Bundesliga at the weekend , a clear sign .
The football is responding to the deteriorating situation in Germany and secures the policy to its aid in dealing with the problems .
`` I consider this to be the greatest challenge of our country since reunification . ''
`` In principle , since no one can say that there is nothing on me , I have nothing to do with it . ''
`` Every individual must be interested in this issue , '' said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach .
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on September 23 , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
`` I am next Wednesday at the Chancellery and meet the Minister , Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor . ''
`` The issue is bound to play a central role , '' he announced .
The football can and wants to help .
But the decisive influence must be the policy .
The German Football Federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative `` 1 : 0 for a welcome '' by four years .
`` Over the Egidius-Brown Foundation , we have ensured that this program runs until 2019 , '' said Niersbach on the fringes of the UEFA meeting in St Julian's/Malta .
Also some support for this program .
Already this weekend put the 36 professional clubs , a clear sign , if they are on the left sleeve jersey instead of the usual sponsors logos ( Hermes ) says `` we help - Refugees Welcome . ''
`` We also want to make clear that all are supposed to help , where and how they can , '' said Leverkusen sports chief Rudi Völler `` image '' newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the plan as `` self-evident . ''
`` The refugee drama goes to everyone , no one should '' look .
`` We can for football , no , we must use our power , our influence and our ability to help the many refugees who have been so incredible , have suffered , '' said Hertha manager Michael Preetz .
Hope Homes managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a `` prominent symbol of the league . ''
For the European Championship qualifying match against Hungary in this Friday , the national team of the women 's 100 refugees after Halle/Saale .
Niersbach described the support as `` a large group of refugees of German football . ''
All 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their villages , is great .
Equally great is that , as small and tiny clubs are active .
`` The message '' 1 : 0 for a welcome , which we have spent , lived in football .
`` This is of enormous importance , '' he said .
In this year and next year , the association is working with the DFB selection and the federal government each 300000 euros for the integration of refugees .
`` The clubs have taken up the whole sum for 2015 already , '' said Niersbach .

Delicate folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg

He was standing next to a flip chart , which has recorded the shy-looking folk the picturesque US state of Michigan with a felt-tip pen .
The entire audience , about 40 people , was almost taken by Stevens lectures .
He recounts in the different places that he is still drawing on the map , which will report its meticulously and delicately arranged songs .
Where they are born and how it looks like there , in his home .
Since then , Stevens is proving to be a wonderfully creative .
With the 2003 and third album , `` greetings From Michigan : the Great Lake State '' appear wise composed songs that nestles snugly close to American folk music of the late sixties , but each time drifting into great opulent .
There is a rumor that `` Michigan '' would be the first part of an audacious series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row .

Europe 's refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , refugees return
Hungary declared a state of emergency and drops from the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to enter the country illegally , all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants .
Chaos ensued at the border , as hundreds of migrants gather in a no man 's land , and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
The people who fled from violence , got stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land on the road between the two countries control points and erected tents and settled down there .
But frustrations grew .
As a police helicopter hovered over them , the migrants chanting `` open the border ! '' And shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police .
Some lawn in protest of food and water .
Serbia 's Foreign Minister said that it was `` unacceptable '' that migrants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not the collateral damage .
It must take place in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries , `` said Ivica Dacic , in Prague .
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels to agree on a common immigration policy .
The minister , however , agreed to share the responsibility for the 40000 people who sought refuge in überrumpelt Italy and Greece , they expressed their hope that finally - next month - or until the end of the year reached an agreement that the EU states would pick up a further 120000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
Chancellor Angela Merkel , Austria , on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union , to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent .
Hungary was not , however , his hopes for a speedy action by Brussels or by its neighbors .
The state of emergency on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , so they closed off roads and were able to speed up asylum procedures .
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said meanwhile that his country is also building a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania plan to stop the influx of migrants across the country , once it has completed a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News correspondent Charlie D 'Agata reported that even prison inmates in the race to build a barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia , have been used .
In recent months , Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a major bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban , however , has insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants who are in search of a better life , and not war refugees , are entitled to protection - a view that is sharply at odds with other EU states , including Germany .
The new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , to make the crossing the border or become damaged in the 4-meter ( 13 foot ) high fence , the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime , these laws also set higher sentences for convicted traffickers .
`` Because of the situation that is caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the misery , '' government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
We make it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament must still approve procedural or the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but reporters from the Associated Press have seen on the border of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days .
Gyorgy Bakondi , country-security consultant for Orban , said that authorities have 45 people while trying to cross the border were seized , 15 others have penetrated deeper into the country .
They come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are being accused of committing crimes under the new laws .
Authorities are working to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train cars had arrived with barbed wire to close the borders .

Election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over Bernie Sanders in the national poll , halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead over the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground to her .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 percent ) , while Sanders is in second place , with 27 percent ( an increase of 17 % ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he ran for president , receives the support of 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries .
More than five months before the start of the primaries , the majority of Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their feelings are clear , which candidate they will support .
But Clinton 's supporters are more persistent in their choice than the other candidates .
Since the CBS News poll , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while Sanders scored some gains .
Clinton holds a strong lead among women and moderates , but the margin has narrowed .
Their support among men has fallen markedly , and Sanders is only 5 points behind .
Clinton 's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now at the same level .
However , Clinton still has a large advantage for older voters .
Last month , Clinton was Sanders , with double-digit lead for the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-point margin in this group .
About half of Democratic voters in the primaries across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party .
A quarter would support it with some reservations , and another 15 percent would support it only because she is the nominee .
Six percent would not support them .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton 's current supporters in particular are fascinated by her .
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them .
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton enthusiastically , fewer Republican voters say about their top candidate Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
If Clinton 's supporters will be asked in an open question as to why they want to , that she is the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Of Clinton 's supporters also mentions its connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
Support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited .
As the Vice President raises the potential for the presidency in the balance , 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - even though one-third believes that he should not do it .
If the democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Biden is at the helm .
Supporters of Clinton 's more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders .
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton 's increased ahead of Sanders , 20 points , with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 per cent last month .
Biden is by far a second in this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the `` wählbarsten , '' has risen .
However , with the question of what is important in a candidate , Democratic voters cite issues of eligibility .
Much like last month stands out , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for the primaries , these voters as unacceptable .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some of the important features of their party primaries with voters .
Majorities view Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy , and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Biden raises the three best candidates for honesty , while Clinton 's strength is the leadership .
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many people say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic voters in the primaries , in general , see also Clinton , Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views .
In all of these measurements , around a quarter of Democratic voters do not agree with Sanders .
As questions about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the term of office as Secretary of State , the majority of Democratic voters are satisfied with the primaries with their explanation of the issue and say that it has not influenced their opinions .
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement , while only about one-third is satisfied .
Public opinion was divided on this in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , while 36 percent said that their opinion of it was even worse .
They are mostly Republicans , more than six in 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among a total of registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 fewer points since May .
62 percent of those eligible do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time , 55 percent of the electorate can see across the country including Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy .
Clinton and Trump , however , received good marks for leadership .
Of the six candidates tested Biden , Carson and Bush score best with honesty .
A majority of Sanders looks more honest than that , but as with Carson , many have no opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .

No diet-fruit - mangoes contain lots of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet .
But who wants to take care of his slim line , which is often discouraged by them .

Anyone who eats the fruit , thus supports vision , immune system and metabolism processes in the body .
Buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smelling .
The shell color alone says nothing about how the fruit is ripe , green mangoes also can taste delicious .
They should be stored at room temperature and eat within a few days .
Then , of course , they tasted neat or in sweet dishes .
There is a mango but also hearty dishes .
They soften the bitter taste of some green salads , such as chicory and Radiccio .
And a Mangochutney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and venison .

Shooter at Delta State University left behind letters of apology
After the shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and later in the day before shooting and killing his colleagues - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was `` sorry '' do at the first murder , `` and he could undo it , '' said authorities announced on Tuesday .
The police in Gautier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University , the emergency number around 10 : 00 am on Monday morning call
And said he had shot at someone and killed someone .
Lamb said the emergency call centre staff that the police had to send police to his home .
He said , `` I shot my wife last night , '' and he also mentioned that a `` sweet '' dog in the house , but `` no one will bother , '' but probably will be excited .
The police asked the caller for his name , but he did not have it .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
When police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Prentiss , 41 , and a hand written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : `` I am sorry , I wish I could undo it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me. ``
After writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night , when police surrounded him .
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course , there was something in Mr. Lambs notion . ''
Despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was `` no information , no evidence '' of a `` triangular relationship . ''
Prentiss was Shawn O ' Steen , who testified that they were married about seven years , described as a `` good man . ''
The two were divorced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O ' Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was `` devastated '' .
He said that Prentiss her daughter was `` absolutely the best of friends . ''

Lamb was awarded in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University , a PhD , as its Lebenslau on the website of the university .

Festive friends : the comedy show , which gave us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar images in the show is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , has now become even more desperate than ever , as suicide rates among young men demonstrate on a 15-year high .
It was the main cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK in 2013 , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
In an effort to tackle the problem , announced the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM - campaign against a pitiful life ) in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of the culture in question , which prevents men to seek help when they need it .
Friendship is at the heart of the battle , in order to meet this challenge .
A recent study on more than 2000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the sufferer a high percentage had plenty of friends with `` healthy '' mood , his chances of recovery are doubled .
For those who are not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems .
But , of course , you have to have friends , a friendship can work .
In the age of communication through social media , with its focus on style over substance , the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
Our digital lives , the need to appear strong , vital and successful , doubled , even though in reality the isolation .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values ; money , reputation , social status , all at the expense of the intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship , which has an impact on our mental health , much deeper .
And , like a video game creator and billionaire recently declared that money really can not buy happiness .
The nice thing with Friends was that this focus has been turned on its head .
Each character has been defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shone through the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs , moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the nostalgia of Ross after Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can relate to in any case , even if they are holding back , often to fully explore their feelings .
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me : ... `` my listeners role for people who feel depressed and even murder are endangered , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
The men who contact us , often do not feel able to speak with friends .
The old adage `` I get on with it ' has a huge impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , if one speaks openly about problems . ''
Friends is one of the shows , which comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms .
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendship .
So much to help my objective outsider status on the phone to people in moments of despair , the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so , if you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friends festival with the celebration of the day completely redesigned scenery , then why are you not your friends for a drink with in Central Perk .
Or , even better , if you are sitting in Starbucks alone someone around , you give him a smile and say hello .
You never know what difference your friendship could make .
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the whole - 236 episodes of Friends festival

Xavi : pep Guardiola did 2008 change to the FC Bayern

Xavi : `` there has been an offer from Bavaria . ''
`` Rumenigge wanted me . ''
As a reminder , in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klinsmann , the Bayern .
Guardiola was the reason that not switched Xavi

And the key man for now works for the German record champions : pep Guardiola .

EU plans to double the mercury limit in carnivorous fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and thus consumers expect a significantly higher doses of the nerve toxin .
The consumer organization Food Watch , which is before a proper working paper from the EU , harshly criticised the plans : `` the risks and side effects missed industrial and environmental policies are passed by the full force of pregnant women and infants , '' said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of Food Watch .
According to Wolf Schmidt should be raised to the limits of the nerve toxin for big fish at the end of the food chain , such as shark or swordfish for `` economic reasons '' from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
However , large predatory fish are already so contaminated with mercury that , on the basis of the current limits , around 50 % of the catch may not be sold .
After doubling the limit would then be just 14.5 percent unsold .
In exchange for the easing of the EU , according to Food Watch wants the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams of mercury to 0.1 milligrams per kilogram .
Food Watch but described it as a `` trick '' because smaller Fried fish such as carp are usually so low , that they should stick to the planned limits already .
The reduction in small fish is therefore `` a perfidious distraction , that alone helps the economy , '' said Wolf Schmidt .
Mercury is a heavy metal is highly toxic to humans , which accumulate through the food chain , especially in carnivorous fish .
That is why the Federal Government warns that `` very small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system of unborn children . ''
The German Federal Ministry of Environment said on its website in relation to the current maximum levels but that a `` health risk to the general population '' was not to be expected .
Mercury is mainly through the burning of coal into the environment .
The German coal-fired power plants emit , according to a written disclosure of the Ministry of Environment , the Green MP Anna Lena Baerbock more than six tons of mercury a year , two-thirds of the total amount of emissions in Germany .
The concentration of mercury in fish in roughly the same , the Rhine and the Danube is `` permanent and nationwide exceeded , '' the `` mirror '' was quoted in the paper in March .
Last year Europe-wide included warnings about mercury in fish are already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF .

Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes , thus not only harms the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study of Potsdam .
The good news : the risk of abandonment is declining quickly .
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
This is the long-term study of an international team of researchers , including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition ( DIfE ) in Potsdam , Germany .
Compared to non-smokers , in smokers , the risk of losing their teeth prematurely to the 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher .
The scientists had observed more than 23300 subscribers .
The main causes of tooth loss are cavities and inflammation of the gums , the DIfE .
For these periodontitis is smoking a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
The link between smoking and tooth loss , therefore , go to frequent gum inflammation in smokers .
Is not clear the extent to which smoking also increases the risk for tooth decay .
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk , but within a short period of time , the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research .
However , it could take more than ten years , until the danger to fall back to the level of non-smokers , said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham England .
We need to convince people , to be non-smokers , said study director Heiner Boeing from the DIfE : `` smoking shortens life . ''

A lucky strike by Thomas Müller 's FC Bayern paved the way to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran .
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season .
The world champion Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze in the cauldron of Piraeus had a dream start in the `` mission '' of the FC Bayern .
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Mueller double Pack ( 52/90 + 2 ) and Götzes hits ( earned ) , with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The twelfth home success in the series will be the first step towards final on May 28 , 2016 , in Italy , where Guardiola at the third attempt to finally bring the Henkel Potts to Munich .
Mueller got his 28th goal in the Champions League to Bayern 's benevolent assistance of Olympiakos 's goalkeeper Roberto , who had a shot intended as a flank of the World Cup .
`` We will not underestimate them , '' Bavaria 's captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31688 capture fans - and the thought of Munich .
They showed a focussed and committed performance , without having to shine .
Piraeus had won its last six home games in the premier class , including against well-known clubs like Manchester United , Atlético Madrid or Juventus .
2011 stumbled here also Borussia Dortmund ( 1-3 ) .
But the Bavarians , in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated , did not want to be the next victim .
They were brave , but ran in their offensive efforts often unimaginative to work .
The attacks were often initiated by game shift to external links , Douglas Costa , who opposed the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui rarely occurred .
Müller had more luck on the right when his flank from the right mid-field in the top left Toreck .
In the 66th minute , the world champion of the possible 2-0 .
The best times in one half had Robert Lewandowski .
First of all , when Olympiakos-striker Ideye Brown , the head of the ball , beat Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
Then , by direct inspection , the goalkeeper parried Roberto with the knee ( 35th ) .
Although the Bayern used to affix their dominant game , Piraeus needle stitches .
At goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was our bond .
For example , when he took a shot of Ideye on the Latte ( 56th ) .
Before Guardiola re-erected a chain of four with David Alaba in the centre of defence alongside Jerome Boateng , who made it good .
Mario Goetze , according to muskulären problems back in the squad , was sitting outside .
The World Cup hero was only after the completion of training given the green light , said member Matthias Sammer in `` sky '' : `` anyone who wants to make something different out of it , that is evil . ''
At the first change of Guardiola also decided against him , when he brought Kingsley Coman for beleaguered Lewandowski ( 59th ) .
Goetze came late for Arturo Vidal ( 76 . ) and 13 minutes later , everything was clear , via penalty , Müller .
Before the game , it was in the stadium riot .
After a smaller group of partially masked and Bayern fans in their viewers-block apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went in with batons against the Munich-based supporters .
At least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .

Jewelry as a fashion niche instead of curtain - Plauener lace
In the past it has been in the long stick machines in Plauen to make yards .
The embroidered fabrics and lace were done for clients , for example , processed into blankets and curtains in large quantities .
Now that alone no longer works , explains Andreas Reinhardt , CEO of the fashion Plauen lace .
Instead , the fashion is important .
In the early days of the Plauener lace fashion played a major role , was then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt cites some examples : in jewellery , accessories such as handbags and in regional folk costumes .
The so-called vintage fashion , which is similar to past eras , form a growing potential for orders .
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
They already make up half of all contracts with us .
Fashion Plauen lace is a member of the industry association Plauener lace and embroidery , along with nine other companies .
They are only allowed to wear the label .
In the last 15 years , around 80 percent of its sales are broken apart .
Private shops and wholesale , there are almost no more .
Our products reach the customers in this way .
The mass-produced goods will be cheaper nowadays manufactured in Asia and distributed almost exclusively via chains .
Also schwächle export , up-to-date to Russia and the US .
So , ample reasons for new routes .
The industry association also tried to score through environmental awareness , as Cordula Bauer of the Stick pearl in Falkenstein explains : `` since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially responsible . ''
Reinhardt said : `` it also relates to the materials used . ''
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , and is specialized in embroidery and lace .
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region , something you have to find high-quality and innovative products .
It will take time and courage .
It creates a tension between the freshest ideas of the designer and the companies that need to think economically , `` says Schmidt .
That is why an existing design will often vary only slightly , in order to maintain a customer base .
A few years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter 's newly revived historic snowball .
The machine stitched tiny globules in some places .
The Plauener goldsmith , Bianca Hall Bach-inspired Krauße became : `` before , I could not deal with traditional Plauener lace . ''
Now she uses the pyramid peak for her jewelry .
In an elaborate process , they shaped the pattern in silver .
`` Many people in the region , identify with the theme of Plauener lace - young and old , '' says Reuter .
It also delivers in the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento .
So I see my jewellery as modern ambassadors of Plauener lace .

Is Di Maria to PSG help to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his strike against Malmö .
Di Maria is making its debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG to pull over to Malmö .
Here are the game report and the response to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept track , as Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday .
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player , who brought the French champions on the road , but then they missed a number of occasions , before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61 minute , a Kopfballtor scored .
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk , also in the group A Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions , since they are not the only qualification for the knock-out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate , and he was later in the game against his hometown team and the club , with whom he began his illustrious career back in 1999 , replaced .
`` It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League , so it is a good start to win 2-0 , our opponents look to cause problems and relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have perfected over the course of the season , '' said Blanc .
`` This is a good omen .
We wanted to win and we have won , although I regret that we do not have another one or two more goals. ``
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team , which could hold over the weekend , a 2 : 2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was hammered by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe , when it was taken over by Manchester United last month , and he suggested that why , when he ran into Marco Verrattis pass behind the Malmö-defense before he graduated to Johan Wiland over nicely in the long corner of the net .
However , if someone believed that PSG would be a great victory , was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a play-off , in order to reach that stage , appeared in Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was strung with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle of a difficult opponent .
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , of the far post to Kevin Trapp went over in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PSG himself sometimes , with some bad passes and bad accounts , not least from Ibrahimovic , who has dropped in no less than five attempts in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart .
Nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill , when he brought his players into the game , and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic , Di Maria has turned into a revolving pistol , which was drawn by Wiland in the 52 minute at the post over ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani . The Uruguayer scored his sixth Saisontor after Ibrahimovic had a left-hand flank of Maxwell especially galling .
It ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game , and only a superb intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz , the final result was unable to hold down before replacement players Ezequiel Lavezzi was removed from a gate at the end .
The coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , later admitted that PSG was a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : `` our last Champions League game was in December last year .
Since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which does not have the same level .
The qualifying rounds are not enough. ``
Hats off to Paris ! ! !
It was a great game by them ! ! !

Row houses for refugees , single parents , low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have much money .
So , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : `` not only need Wohnhraum refugees , but also the single mother and the low earners . ''
`` I am showing how you can still build cheap and good , '' says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees are piling into the housing market .
The entrepreneur Mark Gildner believes to know how rapidly cheaper housing can be built : it builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees .
Mr Gildner , many refugees are piling into the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : the mass housing in containers or gym has no sustainability .
For the people to remain a big part here .
Given the influx of refugees , we will need enough housing in the next couple of decades .
A very banal , three-storey townhouse is the solution .
Gildner : a terraced house requires less space .
It facilitates the integration .
It is different if you accommodate people in apartment buildings .
Each of the six houses that were built in the pilot project , consists of three apartments , each for four asylum-seekers .
Each unit has two bedrooms , one bath , a kitchen and a lounge .
It may be that many refugees will say again , there is peace , I will go back .
Then the houses can be easily rearranged to suit the requirements .
What are the costs ?
Gildner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184000 euros , without a plot .
This is manageable .
Six months of construction has lasted .
This is a good thing .
The building codes have complicated their plans ?
Gildner : I was planning my project properly .
Particularly difficult , it always makes the looming sword of Damocles Sonderbau and parking regulations .
Creepy .
It is still assumed that anyone who creates a terraced house of three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
Only in the cities is that they have the space .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How did the locals react to her townhouse project ?
Gildner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury premises for asylum-seekers .
What is definitely not true .
But you do not tighten up the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : but it is true : we had a building boom over the last five years in Germany , but were built luxury homes that can afford a little more .
My project has the message that ordinary people need housing .
Not just refugees , but also the single mother , or the low paid .
I will show how you can still build cheap and good .
That is what it is about .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied micro system technology in Regensburg and initially environmental analyses .

JVA Berlin-Tegel : five-square-metre cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex-prisoner of Justice Correctional Institution Tegel , which was right for months , in a small cell .
Because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to monetary compensation if they are housed in small cells .
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision released on Wednesday .
According to the magistrates , the people affected can even hope to have money if they were just a few days locked up in the tight spaces ( Case 1 BvR 1054/01 ) .
It was an ex-prisoner successfully with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the Justice Correctional Institution in Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a solitary cell with roughly five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not closed off .
After that , the man who , according to his lawyer now been released , had been moved to a larger cell .
Although his term failed lawsuit liability because of the substandard conditions of detention against the city of Berlin .
But the constitutional judges waived the judgment of the court in Berlin and had the case back for reconsideration .
They see the human dignity of the man .
The supreme court will now decide on the amount of compensation
Even if , for legal reasons , from the period in question , only a few days in prison days are crucial for the compensation , whether a compensation claim , it said .
Otherwise it would be `` a decline in the legal protection of personality . ''
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the compensation money .
The constitutional courts in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
They spoke only in April a detainee compensation because he was locked naked in a cell .
Human habitation is the multiple-occupancy of a cell without a toilet , according to a decision by 2011 .
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday , the Constitutional Court of Berlin , which was certified in November 2009 a subhuman housing a prisoner in a parallel case .
Then the plaintiff was more than three months between 15 to 21 hours a day in a row , as in the case of Karlsruhe .
The Berlin prisons were also in the last couple of weeks in the headlines because of a lack of staff .
That is why prisoners are repeatedly trapped 23 hours , the aggression is rising , even unto blows it should be because of the tense situation .
According to the judicial press office 21 posts are vacant in Tegel Airport due to lack of talent , 19 out of 2016 .

Thus , `` Cassini '' back in 2006 at the South Pole ice-volcanoes of the Saturnmond discovered the water vapor and Eispartikel vomit and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn .
At least in the South Pole there had to be an underground sea , the astronomers concluded at that time .

David Cameron certainly knows better , The Lorax ?
It is one thing all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost by heart .
Unless perhaps you are David Cameron .
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children 's book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax , published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr Seuss graced .
It was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super Camps , and continues : `` funny , emotional , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I read to my children , because it always seems to be an image or a message that we have missed so far . ''
All well and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , instead , a summary of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details , in order to expand the original text is rather short .
`` In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where all of nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams , by their desire to see a real tree , '' reads one , a love interest was Dr. Seuss graced , whose real name was Theodor Seuss graced hostage and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
As if that were n't suspicious enough : the text proposed by Cameron reads in part , as the summary of the Lorax-film , which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and so begins : `` in the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams . ''
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the plot of the book is so unfamiliar , here is an unnamed boy listens , as the local environment by the money-grabbing fourth guessing , trees , Thneed knitting Once-ler , despite the protests of the name Lorax , a huddled , his essence , `` which speaks on behalf of the trees , '' is devastated .
It was highly likely that such a relatively low PR task delegated to a worker who has read The Lorax not 20 times in a row , to a child .
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text was likely to have come from Cameron 's constituency office .
Super camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron 's staff , but there was no further immediate comment .

The Brexit camp ( Brexit = Britain 's exit from the EU ) could win , if the economy is in a slump until the year 2017 device
David Cameron 's ill-thought-out Neuverhandlungs Strategy , in order to keep Britain in the EU , will be deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy `` it is yes or no ? '' Corbyn for leader of Labour and the TUC , because Europe is fiercely divided on Tuesday .
Foreigners also have Corbyn 's and Nigel Farage 's .
A European diplomat friend said recently that some member states that are so deeply enmeshed in various crises , such as the EU , it is now , and not always from their own guilt , Britain 's self-created agenda with divided concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty , which they mostly do not want to .
In Brighton the TUC decided at their annual meeting that it may , if they do not jeopardize the social protection .
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie-agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , a photograph of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reform .
It is always about me .
My European friend who wants an outside-looking Britain inside the EU tent - `` let us not only with France , '' says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go .
Cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is an ally , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , as happened with the overly long Ausharrende like Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France 's François Hollande looks back on his re-election or its replacement in 2017 .
He is also a fading force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government , a left-wing Spain .
It is hard to imagine that they will pull a leg to help the Selfie-Brits whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland 's exit from the UK - something they do not want to , because most of them have similar separatist tendencies .
So maybe some even planning such ministers deliberately unhelpful comments , quite the SNP-style , while Britain 's referendum campaign in 2017 , in order to speed up the process of Brexit , my friend .
`` The renegotiation was a bust , '' and `` the UK has won nothing of value from the renegotiation . ''
The Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics is the oligarchy of press barons , as they have during the referendum in 1975 , inspired by Tony Benn but were not supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
They can be weak recall Boris Johnson , the ore-euro opportunist , who has made a name for himself as an `` EU straight bananas '' Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s .
For all its craziness , Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
A Medley of tax-fearing-rogues , phone-hacked foreigners and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers .
Tony Blair actually thought much about it , but found that , if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage , you better distributed bananas to distract him , rather than to his lunch and dinner .
In fact , Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair himself , when he opposed Cameron 's referendum , because Blair was the principle on which the EU Constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , he opened a back door .
He has never forgiven the press .
But to me the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who in Westminster on Monday gave a friendly pat on the back - I told him that he needs to waste no more time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock 's boycott Murdoch strategy in the 80 's , then and now is a mistake .
It can take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win over the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , the BBC sofa he has left on Sunday .
Corbyn 's official position on Europe is - I am - it is in development .
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
Well , most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye-trend and the wild climes of young Tory Engländerismus everyone can probably say yes .
That is what Hilary said `` a Benn , but not a Bennite '' Benn on the radio and on television this week , when the Scouts fought in it , not admitting that Corbyn 's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 1970s , when his old father is on television trying to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without having to go too far and his Kabinettsjob to lose .
Hilarys struggle was still attractive .
But to fight to stay `` under all circumstances '' - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said , nor what JC told his supporters and members at its closing session on Monday evening , according to all reports .
Whatever the rührselig bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news-discipline remains in the era of TV around the clock , important and , above all , in the maelstrom of social media , a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
It is true that Cameron is not a free ticket to Europe , which allows him to keep Labour 's support in the referendum campaign for granted , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyn 's fundamental ambiguity to EU membership - in line with its Bennite Belagerungs-economy , anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents , for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes .
As with its ambiguity to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC will start a campaign for secession - foreign diplomats will be obligated to try to find at home , in particular , a sense of their superiors .
Why should Paris or Berlin , wasting political capital - they have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be pointless ?
The US is already quite disappointed by the lack of military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power , I was reminded at the launch on Monday of what is called British Influence Security Forum .

Muslims bury the Bin Laden family in Mecca - the crane accident killed is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 deaths of Muslims at the first burial in Mecca carried through the streets
Saudi Arabia sets the collapse of part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group on load
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca Grand Mosque .
Grieving , largely filled up dressed in white , the route to pay their respects , as the first of the dead begin their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery .
The funeral procession moved over to the holy site , where only days before a crane through the roof of the mosque and then rushed to the prayer .
The bodies were released to the funeral , when the Saudi king Bin Laden because of the disaster , which also left 394 injured , a sanction imposed on the builders of the family .
The bodies of 29 beter , who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca , were carried through the streets .
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton , Greater Manchester , a father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane crashed down .
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the Grand Mosque .
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city , will continue .
Today , King Salman said that the Bin Laden group would not leave the arm of a crane when he was not used .
An Arab version of the decree , which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
The English-language service of the news agency reported that detail , but said that the leadership of the company were forbidden to travel abroad .
Earlier this week , Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane that collapsed in a courtyard of the Grand Mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims from the Hajj pilgrimage , which takes place later this month , gathered .
The Bin Laden group has issued no statements about the crane collapse , and their representatives were not available for comment .
The Royal Decree also chided the group not because of current security measures and because they have not partnered with meteorologists .
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mecca Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project , which is led by the Bin Laden group .
The Bin Laden family is linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and assumes larger construction projects .
The late leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a renegade son , who in the 1990s was disowned by the family .
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the UK for the pilgrimage at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim is required .
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
Government officials are ordered to pay 1 million rial ( £ 174000 ) to the families of the deceased is the same amount of permanently injured .
Other injuries will receive half of that amount .

Mannheim ecumenical hospice assistance for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz there is brisk business .
The people do their errands , sometimes fast , in part , breath comfortably .
They control the two stations of the Mannheim-based Auto Salon at the Parade Ground .
City cars .
Vibrant , plump life in stunning autumn sunshine and in the midst of four large panels with the heading `` before I die , I would like to ... . ''
The Ecumenical Hospice made with the help of this action on its 20-year anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions .
`` It is about life , so we are left with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , '' said Josefine Lammer .
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice aid is the same for passers-by questions and discussions are available as the volunteer staff .
While many a passerby spontaneously reverts to the chalk and the phrase `` yes , my life , '' read `` , '' `` ride with the campers from the US , '' `` stop the war '' or `` long suffering '' supplements , others remain short , read , say phrases like `` as far as I am not yet '' and then go further .
Again and again on the verge of developing small discussions about the action itself , about the life , dealing with the death .
Peter Hübinger is also on the ground .
`` Only if I am clear that , for me at some point come the end of the world , I can live responsibly , '' says the director of the diakonisch plant in Mannheim , is the winner of the Ecumenical hospice assistance together with the Caritas Association .
Therefore , this action is effective for the public good , 20-year-olds .
Not everyone wants to say publicly on the boards , but is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
The issue of death and dying is still riddled with taboos , so the experience of Josefine Lammer , albeit just the hospice movement in recent years have contributed to the open man .
An assessment of the Angelika Godefroid shares .
The companion of death and mourning is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
Faced with the issue through personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the euthanasia .
When the Ecumenical hospice assistance per call was looking for volunteers , they have been reported immediately and was at the foundation in 1995 .
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the patients and family members in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and hospice St Vincent .
They all are carefully trained .
Angelika Godefroid can cope well with their task and the experience gained and experiences .
`` I see life from a different queue , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , '' she says .
The offer of the Ecumenical outpatient hospice service is free of charge , regardless of confession .
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from members and clubs allows for the training and training and supervision of the pet death and mourning .
Every two years will be offered training for new employees .
The panels on Saturday described are now in the house of the Evangelical Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the home of the Catholic Church ( §F§2§ , § §6§ ) .
There may also be other personal wishes on postcards .

8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously .
Some have tried to brand him as a flop .
Others have dismissed it as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But regardless of how some Republicans are trying to take Donald Trump from the upper echelons in the polls , it has not worked ( yet ) .
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump leading in double digits , and some are beginning to ask themselves seriously , what does it mean for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul .
Of course , it is still too early in the election period .
No one contends that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 , Rick Perry 's leadership on the rising Herman Cain was made , none of which has only won one state in the nominating process .
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush 's super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump 's perseverance and begin to make their dollars go to topple him .
Here are some of the latest poll numbers , which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase .
Trump 's popularity ratings have been rotated by 180 degrees .
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans had a real-estate mogul .
There were 40 per cent by mid-July .
At the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
Now , six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
Roughly three in ten say that they have a negative opinion .
And keep these numbers in early states .
A Quinnipiac-vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump .
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with GOP candidates as Trump .
Last week , in a poll conducted by CNN/ORC , 67 percent of Republicans said they were either `` enthusiastic '' or `` satisfied '' if Trump would be nominated .
Only two out of 10 saying they were `` upset '' if he were the nominee .
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they were `` thrilled '' versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump ) .
The next in terms of excitement ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
On the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they were `` dissatisfied '' or `` angry '' if Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump 's temperament as a problem .
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters leaning to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul had the right temperament for a president , ABC News/Washington Post on Monday .
The same is true in the first pre-election state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander-in-chief , according to the Quinnipiac last week .
Nevertheless , 44 per cent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively , and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament did not fit into the White House , ABC/Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
If they keep their hats to scholars Trump , Republican voters for real .
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , according to a poll by CNN/ORC from last week , four out of ten , that Trump is the best bet .
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP voters did not have the clear crystal globe in the past .
At this time last cycle , four out of ten Republicans , Rick Perry would win the nomination , compared to only 28 % of the final candidate Mitt Romney .
However , it turns out that a large number of GOP voters , Trump 's campaign , viewed as a plausible .
Even if the Republicans are gathered around another candidate , Trump still beats almost everybody .
Some experts suggest that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump 's leadership , while the anti-Trump 's support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates diffuse .
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates , Trump is reaping the majority support .
He has Carly Fiorina 13-point lead before Marco Rubio 14 points , Walker 15 points before Jeb Bush 19 points and , finally , from Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points .
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would be the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race .
A narrow majority of Donald Trump 's fans say that they have formed their opinions .
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump , say that they have lost their voices .
Of course , much can be done to change that , and no one can really say , the view never changes .
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to other candidates .
However , Trump 's strongest competition at the moment the other outsiders , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say that they have formed their opinions , are twice as often for Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump when it comes to immigration .
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called `` rapists '' that immigration was the lynchpin in the public discourse to 2016 .
Some are concerned that the bombastic language critical of Trump Hispanic-Americans will stay away from the Republican Party and will damage the Neuorientierungs 's efforts .
But according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday , six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems to be Donald Trump .
The frustration over the government climbed to new highs .
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson , now accounts for roughly half of the support of Republican voters , particularly by their outsider status .
Six of 10 Republicans say the new Monday-ABC/Post , they would rather have a political outsider , as someone with government experience .
And they are also angry at Washington .
A survey of the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg two weeks ago in Iowa shows that three out of four of Iowa 's Republicans frustrated with the Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent `` unhappy '' and 21 percent `` hellish angry . ''

At its most anticipated meeting in years Federal Reserve strategists spent two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
Looming above them at one end of the ornate two-storey sitting room wall is a picture of the United States .
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues put the economic interests of the nation above all other things .
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : to maximise the US employment and keep prices stable .
But since the great recession , the Fed leaders acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
And this third mandate of the X-factor could be in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . It will be announced on Thursday that if the US economy is ready to start from the unprecedented stimulus by the underlying short-term interest rates close to zero since the end of 2008 to be weaned .
Although most of the economic data show that it is growing solidly , could make the recent turmoil in global financial markets already cautious Fed representatives anxious to reinforce this volatility by raising the interest rate on government bonds , and it is only about a quarter of a percentage point .
`` Obviously , the labor market and inflation will primarily be the most important , what they watch , '' said Lindsey M. Piegza , chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co .
`` But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates , the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justification to continue to wait , '' she said .
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what in themselves the financial market .
About half of the economists who were surveyed recently by Bloomberg , have this week predicted an increase in interest rates .
The financial markets , however , expect a wait of the Fed , with a key indicator , showing only a 30 % chance of a hike .
This suggests a decline in the stock market , if the Fed raises rate , except that the strategists softened the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped to 228.89 points , or 1.4 % .
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy upholds the sentence this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be surprising if the Fed would raise rates at this point , `` he said .
If they do it , `` they would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . ''
Other experts argued that a hike would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
A month ago , the Fed seemed on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US .
Yellen had said during the spring and the summer that they would be required this year , despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress , expect an increase in the rate .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labor market was solid this year .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels that the Fed sees as full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And while inflation has been consistently below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed 's representative said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
`` The economy can sustain higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , '' said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
But the financial markets around the world begin to twitch at the end of last month , after China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell in May by more than 16 % from its highs , as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would curtail global growth .
The market has rebounded slightly this month , with the Dow now at almost 10 % below the high of May .
For the Fed representatives influence the market turmoil of the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates .
`` If the events in the financial markets and the news would not have emerged over the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would tighten the reins in this session , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve .
He now predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the impact .
`` There are a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , '' said Oliner .
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed , so it technically should not be involved in their decision-making .
But in the end , the Fed has become monetary authority in the world .
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
The mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could tighten its monetary expansion `` , '' triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , it can be expected from the Fed representatives that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
`` Their decision-making is more art than science , '' said Zachary Kara Bell , head of global strategy for the asset management firm Envestnet , Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA. , noticed this month that `` the Fed has a history of overreaction on financial market movements , which are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals . ''
Lacker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is campaigning for an increase in interest rates , cited decisions over the years , as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , `` despite limited visible impact on growth in the US , '' said Lacker .
A year later the Fed representatives made these cuts .
The Fed should only aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse first , said Adam S. Posen , a former member of the Committee on the interest-rate setting Bank of England .
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level , he said .
`` They certainly do not want to fall into the situation , in which she has fear of a rate increase , because the markets are excited , '' said Posen , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and no mention of financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that they should jump ahead of the time .

Almost two years after a student during a ritual bullying a student liaison in Pocono Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder charges will be filed against five people .
Members of New York 's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Fraternity Chun `` Michael '' Deng during a brutal initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police said .

Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches , he then fell unconscious .
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Fraternity called the emergency number 911 , fainted after Deng and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
However , they had the time to move on to Deng 's clothes , googled his symptoms and Andy Meng , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood in order to catch up with the Council , the police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
`` At this point , the members began to hide equipment and the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about the Michael Deng , '' said Police Chief Wagner .
He could not be revived and he died of his injuries the next morning .
After an autopsy report , Deng has been repeatedly inflicted by blunt force injuries to the head , torso and thighs .
`` Too many families have been destroyed by the bullying of the Brotherhood , at least one student dies every year since 1970 to the bullying , '' said Douglas Fierberg , a lawyer who represents Deng 's family , in a statement .
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable , and this move by authorities is very important .
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members .
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr. Meng , also indicted for vexatious attacks and forming a criminal organisation .
`` We do not want to blame the people involved , but only if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this , so we will hold them accountable , '' Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday .
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national fraternity has revoked its affiliation to the group .

EU Commission proposes in row over new court TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned trans-Atlantic free trade agreement , TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
The controversial private arbitration institutions for resolving disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which is far more traditional in its functioning .
`` We want to establish a system , the trust of the citizens , '' declared the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the launch .
The Swede has , to put forward the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States .
The German government announced support .
Via TTIP is intended to create the largest free-trade zone in the world , with 800 million people .
The plans to reform the current arbitration specifically stipulate that the EU countries and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
They are in equal parts from the EU , the US and from non-EU countries .
Is also scheduled for the first time a second resort .
It would make it possible to collect judgments against the opposition .
So far , the procedures involved with each other on the referee , it was not an appeal against their sentences .
In the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice are not trusted , Malmström said .
In the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to their own .
There could then be addressed , for example , also disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
In particular , required by large corporations , investor-state arbitration ( ISDS ) is considered one of the main reasons for the huge resistance to TTIP in Europe .
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , on the corporate compensation at the expense of the taxpayer can wrest , national laws to nullify or a lowering of consumer protection and environmental standards .
In early statements anti-TTIP organizations like Campact described the proposals by the EU Commission as inadequate .
It was criticized , in particular , that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free-trade agreement with Canada ( Ceta ) .
The German economy Staatssekretär Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major step forward .
The Commission has taken into account in the reform of key points , the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel is working with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
The old system of private arbitration was off the table .
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström .
The European companies ' organization warned that the action potential of the economy by restricting too many new rules .
In particular , small and medium-sized businesses could be adversely affected , it said .
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed on Wednesday , remained unclear .
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013 .
The issue of protection of investors , however , has not yet been discussed with the United States .
Originally , there should be a framework for the agreement as early as the end of this year .
This date is regarded as no longer tenable .

Internet sales rose in August at the slowest and the Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015 , there were seven per cent rise in online sales .
Last month , there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales grew three years ago by the use of mobile phones to shop
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has put the brakes on spending
For more than a decade , the virtual shopping has boomed , and many of Britain 's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
But experts say that there are now signs that the online sales will stagnate , after new figures showed only seven per cent in the first three months of 2015 .
The total spending for August , the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 with only a five percent increase over the previous year .
Experts say that there are signs that online sales will stagnate , after new figures show only 7 % growth in the first three months of 2015
`` If you look at the growth rates for the previous year , and go back to 2000 , it has evolved over time , '' said Andy Mulcahy , editor of the Guardian IMRG-sales index .
He said that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started with their mobile phones to make purchases .
It meant that more people were able to shop online and that people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the couch .
But now it is leveling off , and we will probably see that growth is decreasing .
The Black Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the declining revenues .
Experts believe that , buyers keep their purchases before the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year , rallied five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bargains , and some retailers ' websites plummeted .
Experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fight for bargains could deter buyers to make purchases .
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that spending by £ 5 a bit more than £ 1 was spent online .
For some products such as televisions and washing machines , more than one-third of purchases are now being carried out on web stores .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chain in the inner cities .

Mr. Mugabe , Africa 's oldest leader , fell at the beginning of the year by a panel down the stairs .
He was uninjured , but the video of the event spread quickly on social media .
The opening of Parliament was also marred by allegations of the opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned to accompany the speech by Mr. Mugabe with booing .
Last month they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Nation speech in parliament - this is the speech he reiterated on Tuesday .
The spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) - innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians receive SMS messages on their mobile phones , which have warned them not to interfere with Mr. Mugabe 's speech .

Refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tight .
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable home .
The pressure on the housing market is growing .
The social housing sector is facing a challenge .
The fights on the German housing market have long since begun .
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many large cities .
They compete with low-income citizens in the last affordable housing .
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing , need to be built by 2020 , every year , 400000 new units .
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Associations Alliance ' social housing ' .
For comparison , this year will be held in Germany to 260000 units .
Thus missing 140000 homes .
Refugees are no longer obligated to the first three months of their stay to live in a reception as accommodation for asylum seekers .
Many then come across the housing market and in the long queues at a rental apartment .
The German Federal Statistical Office states , however , lived in the last year , less than half of all asylum-seekers .
However , the negative development of the housing market is not only because of the increasing numbers of refugees .
The study also draws significant failures in the housing policy of the last few years .
Germany is pushing a housing deficit , which grows from year to year .
Currently lacking in the conurbations around 770000 units , Matthias Günther complained , author of the study .
Many workers lived in big cities are inevitably in WG-rooms .
Young adults were involuntary because of the downturn in the housing market in the longer `` hotel Mama . ''
In the big cities , the number of square metres per head for the first time in recent years has fallen again .
In order to solve the problem , the alliance of `` social housing '' suggests a fresh start .
With new incentives to boost social housing .
It could be dispensed with the estate tax and the property taxes on a temporary basis for subsidised housing .
Moreover , according to alliance of attractive tax relief are needed .
The support programme for refugee accommodation of state bank KfW plays well in cities and towns already .
A good week after the start was already more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available retrieved on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
Now , the project could even be increased .

Now Rome has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there are now in Rome , a Martin Luther Square .
In the presence of City president Ignazio Marino was baptized in the name of the German reformer on Wednesday , a previously anonymous place in the park on the Oppio Hill .
He will be on the `` Piazza Martin Lutero '' now `` as the German theologian of the Reformation . ''
The park is located next to the Colosseum in ancient Rome .
The name was requested by the Association of Evangelical churches in Rome .

The BBC should give up EastEnders , says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice , he said that commercial rivals `` would give their right arm '' for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters .
He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in solid timeframe against the most popular shows of their rivals and channels such as BBC4 .
After the BBC 's Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he had been trying for six years during his time at Channel 4 , without success , to come into contact with the BBC .
`` I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes or broadcasts , which were also shown clearly by not subsidised rivals , '' said Johnson , the House of Lords Communication Committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I believe in the medium or long term is not a good idea , you should at least take his production on programs that others do not make or commission .
They send out The Voice in a prime-time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future .
The idea that no one else would show that this is a joke , it is ridiculous , of course it is nonsense .
Johnson said : `` I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could be financed without subsidies .
The Voice is such a program , EastEnders is another , admittedly , both in-house productions .
To be honest , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I am doing my best to see how this is supposed to be public service television .
I do not think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a contractor for the series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of ratings `` because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support . ''
His comments on the BBC 's most popular broadcasts give back what was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like EastEnders .
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programmes on BBC4 should go , `` where one can not fairly judge the audience , but they can fulfil their tasks , and they argue that if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , `` well , of course , we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has ever seen. ``
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see them .
On the broadcasting fee , Johnson told the committee : `` I call on you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
Of course , you all think that we all think that for £ 150 per year here gets a great value , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , wonder if that is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to inform , educate and entertain `` . ''
He said that only a little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take a leaf out of the publicly-owned television stations in Australia and Canada , change it to `` inform , educate and entertain . ''
On the issue of partnerships , said Elstein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , which he said that only a handful will be shown on television , and alliances with the commercial channels , in order to make everything available online .

Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus was painted with the ( gold-plated crown of thorns ) is one of the main works , Otmar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alte Post has written the introduction of updated and Biblical texts .
At the beginning was the word ?
No , not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible , which is now with splendid images .
In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt , who has formulated 150 motives of his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
His `` language '' with bright colors and fanciful shapes of the 75-year-old has won - but what is not synonymous with `` funny '' pictures .
On the contrary , adapted to the specific issues that may seem pretty bleak .
About three years , Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible-project , for which he has made a subjective artistic choice from the many issues of the `` book of all the books . ''
Cycles are created that address issues such as crossroads , plagues , bids , or the Our Father .
He is fascinated by spontaneously several partners : this applies to the Lutheran publishing house with its theological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing house , with its emphasis on art books .
And there is , above all , the author Klaus Alte Post , who has dealt with the Bible on the basis of the painting .
He has interpreted the Bible by Otmar Alt-selected and so to the present day , `` translated into current correlations . ''
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old paintings .
They are embedded between the original bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , here expressed his own personal thoughts on the particular situation .
The jewelry has golden cover letters .
This allows the 75-year-old girl twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high degree of intimacy .
Emotions were ultimately led to the Bible Project : Otmar Alt , 1940 in Wernigerode , born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order .
`` As the education ever happened with the cane , '' recalls Otmar Alt .
`` I have tried to cope with this , to me , perhaps with the Lord , '' father .
His second concern was to restore art in fast-paced time to give more importance : `` the perception of visual worlds today is influenced by advertising , and it is loud .
Symbolism is being suppressed .
Artists have a different desire and bliss to show things .
Pictures have always been somewhat mysterious , and are not decorative .
`` In this respect , I am a dinosaur . ''
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to the images of `` fall '' , they seem to be discovered , and what power they have : `` the picture is looking for his counterpart . ''
Klaus Alte Post admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation , `` has always been '' to be a lover of Otmar Alt art : `` I like how he lives with his pictures . ''
It did not look old , the Bible to fully comprehend , but for the important issues , even mysterious .
`` This was not a collaboration on a level playing field , '' says Alte Post : `` this is about the images , the text only . '' Was a picture-Bible .
For Hans Möhler of Luther 's publishing this work is to find an invitation to deepen `` his life and freedom . ''
Otmar Alt pictures speak for Möhler , both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
Some of the originals - paper and canvas paintings for the first time - will be presented in an exhibition that will open on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation .

The well-known defendants are not guilty .
One of them was also charged with abuse of office .
By this accusation , he has been effectively cleared last May .
The current trial was postponed .
According to prosecutor Robert Riffel had emerged in the preliminary examination that the defendants in the years 2006-2011 funds of club accounts , on which they were allowed in their functions , used for private purposes .
He estimated the damage at around 400000 euros .

`` Then we were faced with the situation : we continue to lead the club or we terminate ? , '' said one of the defendants , in a large bread professional auditor of the Financial District .
He and his colleague and co have decided to take on this task .
With all the risks .
`` We have money , upfronted our life insurance as collateral at the bank , '' he said at the hearing .
With the club , it was agreed that they can manage the money , it may only be made no debt .
Furthermore , with adequate financial success - the payment of the allowances retroactive to 1991 had been decided .
Therefore , it is a part of the allowances only years later , in the year 2003 , when an increase in the bank account had been paid off .
So , too , seemed flat and not Detailabbuchungen , explained the former chairman of the operations .
The managed accounts and savings books together , the two defendants , said the second defendant .
Why the payouts , the club have not been disclosed in detail , asked the judge .
The club was not interested in the details of the finances , important only if the debt was freedom , according to the answer .
In 2011 , as against the began an official investigation for abuse of office , was paid an amount of EUR 120000 on the association 's bank account .
The reserves have been declared the defendants .
This securities account amounted to the name of the second defendant and was not known , according to its statement to the club .
`` Why ? '' The judge wanted to know .
The respondent knew no answer .
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
If something had happened to him , no one would have known something of this money , the prosecutor in the room .
The co was informed , the official added .
This transfer was phrased as `` damage reparation . ''
Why ? Concept , judge and public prosecutor wanted to know .
This is the first defendant stated that he was not satisfied with this wording , because the club would never have suffered damage .
But what do I do if the lawyer says : `` you are all off the hook . ''
`` I am a lawyer ? '' He asked .
In addition , the official said that he never got a cent of salary , he was charged only mileage allowance and diets .
He attended the club salary of EUR 1000 per month , the actual cost was much higher , however , he added .
Accurate records for the early years of the defendants were not present .
They are following a business review , in which everything has been judged to be correct , was not kept , they said .
Miles also had money in the second defendant .
All of the fixes were in cash that he had to travel from his home international market to the bank after Bleiburg , he declared in his statement .

Arsenal 's captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wils here
Wenger stressed to Brentwood here that it was not until September , and if his rehabilitation goes smoothly , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario already means that Brentwood here surely will miss at least the next four games for England , and given his history , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is still uncertain .
The great shame in this current problem is that here the Brentwood last season had ended badly after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the early season .
`` This type of injury is not career threatening , '' said Wenger .
It is a bone that does not heal well .
This is not a major issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not in connection with his ankle , or with the injury he had before .
This may be true from a purely medical point of view , but , as Wenger acknowledged , there is also the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
It has also developed a nasty pattern .
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different pathologies of Brentwood here since his debut six years ago .
He played in only 65 games for arsenal 157 league over the last five seasons .
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08 , which most violation days .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury during the last season will continue .
`` Sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you must strengthen your body and fight to win , '' Wenger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body is stabilized , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday , and Wenger is a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start .
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs , Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
`` I am trying to keep the balance and the players who need a little breather , '' Wenger said .
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to progress from Group F , the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the most intimidating effect in Europe .
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games , after the `` invincible '' campaign was launched in the last season .
The stadium on Tuesday evening was shattered by an earthquake , measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes that Arsenal 's lesson has been learned from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European cup triumph with his management .
`` This drive is immense , '' said Wenger .
It has never worked for Arsenal .
In 2006 , we were very close , but on the other hand , I am long enough in the business , to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not a dreamer .

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is fighting back against rivals due to claims of fighting ring
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism of the tackles of his players as `` agenda setting '' of two Premier League favourites of the NRL .
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referee the Storm players `` wrestling '' with his team during the high storm-victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled comment on the Storm team after his team 's final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night , he had called the game a `` textbook example '' of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not `` good '' in the rings .
Bellamy 's Tacklimg defended his team and said that they were the only tackles on their `` contact us '' .
Bellamy added that the criticism from two leading trainers at his team confident agree with him , because it meant that they were concerned to be smitten by the Storm Team .
`` It always reappears - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling matches , when they have beaten us 24 : 2 , '' Bellamy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that in the whole year , we have nothing in our defensive system or techniques , but we have changed our contact with Tackles a real focal point in the last six weeks , and it has done for us , the trend .
Trent is there now for three years , and he obviously has a great team to work out , so he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
It is funny how it always reappears at this time of year .
Bellamy has Bennett 's idea of the `` exciting football '' and attacked his mentor , recalling that Bennett 's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with `` boring '' football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how her game was exciting , `` said Bellamy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was criticized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take care of a shit about shit .
But he now has a team that can play and what we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
That is the ball game that you play , if you want that type of player .
He made that statement in 2010 , now that he wants all of his type of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like this .
I am counting on greater trust , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
Six weeks ago they would not have thought of us when it came to the Big Game .
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against Roosters achieved a higher result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys .
The game of the Broncos was a good game , I have not yet seen it , but what was the outcome ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but this is an exciting game ?
Or are making breaks and no points something exciting ?
For me , it is the game plan .
If they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a single phase .
The Storm team won this weekend , as they have the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the Vorfinale at AAMI Park , the ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning .

`` Important notice : go from 15 to 18 September with the DLR ? '' ( Docklands Light Railway ) you read in the characters of the London Underground and the DLR 's trademark line , which converts the image of a tank .
In September , a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR ... customers will be asked to help stop the Arms Fair .
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the museum for cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland .
A group called the Special Patrol Group , helped in the distribution in London and used `` ad Space Hack Packs '' , a £ 6-pack of Inbusschlüsseln , from which it is claimed that `` access to about a third of the bus-advertising space on the planet . ''
Transport for London this Plakatier- `` vandalism '' is not funny .
One of the parody ads , was produced by the Special Patrol Group .
After Gavin Grindon , curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex , artists will be more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
Many artists do with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
Another of the anti-arms-trade-posters greet commuters on the tube .
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , the nonprofit works with the graphic designer and voiceover artist , who also works for free .
VCCP-creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the silence that prevailed around the advertising of the arms fair - by a space of the ExCeL-calendar - and thought : `` we are giving them the campaign that they are trying to avoid . ''
They played with the invention of a realistic shady corporate advertising , but it remains more liable `` by the Einbläuen with bright colors and animation . ''
`` You have done a fantastic job , by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the show , '' says Tom Davies of Amnesty .
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be illegally traded on our doorstep .
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL , where exhibitors euphemistic fantastic products sold off .
In a press release Saab revealed a mission of the US Army on `` the RS downed AT4CS from the shoulder . ''
These include a `` uniquely shaped warhead , the prominent Nachwirkungs effects inside the goal . ''
Whatever the causes , it will not be pleasant .

Eight golden rules for students living in residence halls
Eleven years ago , when I pulled myself forget 19-year-old in a student dormitory , still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism , but only now do I remember the strained smile of those who I have offended - and the numerous , long-winded complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned , can be distilled into eight simple rules .
The indentation in student residences ranging from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying .
It is tempting to chatting , telling people where you are coming from , whether and where you have taken sabbatical , where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you love `` to be honest neither Marmite nor hate , because seriously , guys , it is just a yeast extract HAHAHA , I am in my room . ''
Do not breathe .
And help others to do the same - you questions and you show interest .
It distracts the conversation and helps you find the people who you would like , in contrast to those with whom you do not talk , even if your eyelashes were on fire and that fire extinguishers .
Let people .
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions , film-night venues and local venues , but they are also the places where people get dressed up and her underwear .
Referring to this : do not forget to start at the university with a relationship
Introvertierte received a harsh treatment at the university .
Your room should be a refuge , but many student residences form a room-to-room walk-in culture , which is friendly and socially responsible and can lead to life-long friendship .
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
Nothing in the culture allows you to say : `` I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you have to leave , so I get the energy back , which I have used for the interaction with you . ''
You try to knock on when a fellow students of sociability is exhausted - and send him a text message .
Speaking of knock : just do it .
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a door is not closed to an invitation .
He saw a couple of things .
Close friendship through baking .
As you begin the university at the height of the back-mania , is the knock on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate of brownies , less strange than the greeting of the 1950s- `` welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked something to you , and please smile now when I ask you a few personal questions . ''
Offering homemade goodies is a good way to make friends .
Her roommate feel obliged to entertain and perhaps end up associating your face with a delicious surprise .
Of course this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
Badly mixed up clumps of flour , sugar and fat mean that people are asleep , when you knock on the door .
To steal food , is a common crime in student residence halls .
Of course , the hoof is a theft of chicken , but it is the capture of a drop of Milchs for your tea too ?
Check the milk with the owner .
The chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook at home .
If someone steals your stuff , that is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but you are trying to deal with it more balanced than my resident who added their milk a detergent , to punish thieves .
She is now in prison .
They should not make a noise , which prevents people from sleeping or at work .
It is not just about being a decent man , but that you belong to the people in the truest sense of the proverb , who live in glass houses .
A girl on my floor , their neighbors asked if they had something , Drum & Bass a little quieter , because it is three o 'clock in the morning , and on the morning of a test .
They responded with loud music .
When they finally stopped at 5.00 p.m. , they left their neighbours kindly sleep another two hours before they had their own music plärren graduated to their door , and came to their three-hour exam .
Would it not be romantic , if your future spouse would coincidentally in the same residence ?
Conversely , it would not be deeply embarrassing , if you are a resident of your future Ehepartnerin adhere to them ranmachen , disconnect again and they will have to see every day and , perhaps , see how they are all common friends over ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot resident definitely is not your future Ehepartnerin , you at least try to persuade your abdomen a little common sense .
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his room , not closed , is the fine line between having fun appealed and bullying than it seems .
A good prank is funny , but it takes only moments before it becomes a boomerang .
Give you perverted by hiding a valuable and enjoyable lesson about security - but never someone you room with toothpaste and shampoo .
You shut your door , and you put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but tackern you their possessions on the ceiling of no more than twice .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : `` we are creating the ''
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
What will come to Germany ?
Around 800000 asylum-seekers are coming to predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year after Germany , according to the Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) in Germany is even capable of absorbing a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has shown determination in light of the unusual challenge : `` I say again and again : we can do that , and we do it . ''
What is coming to Germany , gives the following overview .
Needed for different forecasts of between 350000 ( estimate of the Bundesbauministerien ) and 400000 ( estimate of Pestel Institut ) homes a year - and the next five years .
That is almost twice as much as previously built homes ( 250000 ) .
Dramatically , is the lack of housing but especially for affordable rental properties fall : 60000-80000 social housing out of the rental price fixing , and these attractive apartments are also applying for refugees .
Bundesbauministerin Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) , therefore , wants to double the promotion of currently 518 million to one billion euros .
Is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute : 80000 social housing per year and would have to invest for the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year .
Scientists are in agreement and Bundesbauministerin that there should also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , is the assumption that 55 % of the Geflüchtete in Germany can be employed in the long run .
However , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications , in order to help them at the start , criticized Claudia Walters , project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation .
The integration of refugees is crucial , but whether they can find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation of the host society , but also for the self-esteem of the immigrant population migration , says researcher Dietrich Thränhardt .
In Germany , there has been a political turning point , according to Thränhardt : the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of the work .
While there has been a work ban on asylum seekers for up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the duty of residence , the asylum seekers to a place of residence .
In society - is also due to the shortage of skilled workers - the majority view that refugees should be allowed the faster access to the labour market .
A big hurdle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
So far , there is not yet a sufficient number of general and vocational language courses .
Studies also show that most jobs through personal contacts .
The construction of networks therefore believes is the royal road to work integrating Thränhardt .
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents send their children to the Kita , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : `` for the displaced parents , it is very important to keep the family together , '' said Ilja Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
Nevertheless , the family of the benefits of Kita , to convince the administration distributed hand slips into different languages .
Should greatly increase the demand for teachers by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example , by allowing multiple schools .
In the countries students are prepared for the classroom without knowledge of German in welcome .
But they are not always informed by fully qualified teachers , but , as in Berlin , also of teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language .
There is no shortage of them , says Beate Stoffers from Berlin 's school of administration .
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle , no state prohibits asylum seekers or Geduldete study - the only exception has been Berlin Interior Senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) , but now has abandoned its position .
Studierwillige ! Studierwilligen refugees could facilitate the access to higher education .
For refugees with a residence or outsourcing , no tolerance for the asylum seekers more power when they begin their studies .
The latter have basically no Bafög , because they do not fall within the circle of bafögberechtigten people .
Tolerated refugees have so far lived in Germany for four years , in order to be entitled Bafög , from 1 January 2016 to shorten this period to 15 months .
But this funding gap must be closed , Steffen call noise , Berlin 's state secretary for science , and the Deutsche Studentenwerk .
The students should be given immediate Bafög .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many of the refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should Islam gradually give the same rights as you have the churches , and the existing state-church law to a new state-religion relationship develop .
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association , a professional to take care of the newcomers .
The rights include duties .
The representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some control .
It also includes the willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Ayman Mazyek , said on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany .
Those who wanted to fight such conflicts in Germany have `` forfeited their right to live in Germany , '' he said at the Bayerische Rundfunk .
He suggested that the Basic Law to be translated into Arabic .
Integration in the future will be much more so than today , to be an issue for society as a whole .
It will also have to change the majority society , more pressing , the elimination of discrimination and racism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - less than a decade since an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law .
But it very slowly learns how the NSU-murder series showed that the police and authorities have systematically ignored the racist motive .
Equal opportunities for all : what immigrant organizations and interest groups do not need white Germans have been demanding and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention Germany commit to remain peacefully in the next few years if the country and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
Germany in general is able to supply the refugees so far expected medical doctors , says President Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
`` As regards Man- power and capacity , we create , '' he told the Tagesspiegel .
However , this extra money needs to flow into the system .
In order to avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery , calls for all comers in health registration cards .
Services rendered could later be charged with the federal states .
And in the long term it is highly questionable , so many people being fobbed off with limited capacity , the catalogue of the asylum seekers ' performance .
Otherwise , make the doctors above all to create the language barriers .
Until now , Berlin has shown health scientist Thea board , migrants are less informed about their illnesses than other patients .
Not only in clinics , in doctors ' offices interpreting costs would have to be accepted , calls for it .
Would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical correspondents in the emergency room .
And with another diagnostic .
For example , among refugee children there are considerably more unprocessed disability , and the young people it is about HIV awareness .
With the other partial symptoms German doctors came forth from their training but clear , says Montgomery .
`` Parasites or tuberculosis infections are not so difficult to see . '' And as for the shortage of doctors , perhaps even by the refugees , relief in sight .
The Syrians have a highly developed education system , many refugees are even doctors .
In order to be permitted , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass exams again .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany , according to estimates by the German psycho therapists chamber ( BPtK ) insane : most are suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable , said Dietrich Munz , president of the BPtK .
A recent study by the University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child trauma arrives in Germany .
Anyone who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder is unwell , among other things , on so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath , dizziness , palpitation , and fears of death .
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration , strong Schreckhaftigkeit and emotional numbness .
In order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , early treatment is necessary , said Munz .
So far , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees a psychotherapy .
While mentally ill asylum-seekers in the social services make an application for psychotherapy , but the treatment usually lasts several months .
In addition to the social services usually clerk or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether or not a therapy is necessary .
This often leads to miscalculations , says Munz .

Metcash launches Bodenständigkeits campaign to combat incursions by Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores in an Aldi-rally in South Australia and Western Australia .
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a Bodenständigkeits-campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a 700 million $ Aldi invasion .
While Aldi prepares for the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengthen Metcash and IGA supermarkets , their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand through IGA mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well on events such as Adelaide show .
IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo from Dunsborough , distributed the samples in IGA stores and shop owners to sell cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
It is expected that Metcash further details of his defense strategy , published on September 29 , when the wholesale distributor of food , alcohol and equipment conducts its annual investor Strategietag .
There is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia generate nearly 30 percent , and higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Oststaat of Metcashs IGA store shops .
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously insular and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in the Oststaat .
However , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi is twelve months after opening its first markets snapped up around five percent of the food market in those two states , and all the existing players , but mostly independent retailers will take away sales .
A report published this week estimated that the analyst Tom Kierath from Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers $ 360 million in sales per year and Metcash $ 250 million could lose by the end of 2016 .
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi opened 25 stores next year in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million will be in every market .
The loss in the food business and the volume of Metcashs high fixed-cost base could Metcash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr Kierath .
At the same time loses Metcash market share in the Oststaat , primarily at Aldi and Coles , although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs sales in the food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 will fall and the market share of 14 percent to 10.3 % in 2015-2020 will be reduced .
Last week told the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass , founder of Magellan Financial Group , at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade . Metcash .
Metcash declined to publicly respond to the comments of Mr. Douglass .
But it is believed that a board member of Metcash has recorded with Mr. Douglass last week .
IGAs market share has fallen from 18 per cent since 2010 to 14 percent , and income from Metcashs food trade , which supplies roughly 1200 IGA retailers , has fallen by 43 % since 2012 , which reflects the operational deleverage at the same time , pressure on sales and margins .
The big retailers are fighting back , however , and has invested more than $ 150 million to improve selling prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week to assimilate and IGA retailers to improve their shops by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private-label foods .
Metcashs chief executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and remediation programs at Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will in 2017 for the first time in four years to return to profit growth .

The Brexit camp ( Brexit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain in popularity if the economy up to the year 2017 in a lull
David Cameron 's half-baked Renegotiation strategy in order to keep Britain in the EU , are advised with each passing day deeper in trouble , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy `` Is it Yes or no ? '' Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC , the split over Europe on Tuesday , sharply atomizer .
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farage 's .
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some of the member States , mired so deep in a number of crises , such as the EU , it is now time , and not always from their own fault , Britain 's self-created Agenda with split concessions and disturbing changes to the contract that you do not want to usually are satisfied .
In Brighton , the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it is like this also , if they do not compromise social protection .
We could call it Dave and Georges Selfie Agenda .
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance of climbing to the summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that you have to win allies for reforms .
It 's always about me .
My European friend who wants an outside view , in the end , the UK Inside the EU tent - `` do n't Leave us alone with France , '' says Berlin - and suggests that more and more short-sighted Ministers and civil servants have come in some of the main cities up to the point where you do n't care about whether we stay or go .
Germany 's careful prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she 's since 10 years in Power , and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for you , as it is done in the excessively long , Held-out , such as Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) , and cabbage ( 16 ) .
Of France Francois Hollande looks on his re-election or his replacement in the year 2017 .
He is also a fading force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government , Spain a left .
It is hard to imagine that they will bend over backwards to help the Selfie-the British , whose energy should be better used gravel to prevent the country 's exit from the UK - something you do n't want to , because the most similar separatist tendencies .
Therefore , some such Minister for planning may even be intentionally non-helpful notes , all in the SNP style , while Britain 's referendum campaign in 2017 , in order to speed up the Leaving process , presumed to be my friend .
`` The renegotiation was a Bust '' and `` the UK has nothing of value from the renegotiation . ''
The Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street may be at your cost , and which of the EU-skeptics is not the oligarchy of press barons , as they were during the Tony Benn inspired by the referendum in 1975 , but that our entry in 1973 , supported with a ratio of 2:1 .
You can remember weak to Boris Johnson , the arch-Euro-opportunist who has made a name for itself as a `` EU Straight bananas '' Brussels correspondent in the early 90-ies .
In all of his madness , Ed Miliband , who were his enemies knew .
The Medley of tax-fear-rogue phone hack ends of foreigners and the Pseudo-Non-residents , who own most of our major Newspapers .
Actually , Tony Blair thought the same way about you , but when you 're sitting with a hot Gorilla in a cage , it is better distributed bananas to distract him , instead of his lunch and dinner .
In fact , Miliband was more Blairianer as Blair himself , as he sat down in Cameron 's referendum vortex , because Blair had put the principle on the non-adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , opened a back door .
The press forgave him for that .
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave it to me on Monday in Westminster a friendly Pat on the back - I told him that he need to waste any more time for me - seems to be in danger , Neil Kinnock 's Boycott of Murdoch 's strategy for the 80-to repeat it , a error then and now .
It may take a while , but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , the BBC Sofa , he has to leave on Sunday .
Corbyns official Position of Europe is - and I Express it in a friendly way - in the development .
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU .
Now , most people outside of Ukips traditional Blue dye tendency and the Wilder climes of Tory Small-Englishman can tell everyone Yes .
It is what Hilary `` A Benn but not a Bennite '' Benn on the Radio and on television this week said , as the path struggled finder in it is not to admit that Corbyns appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 70 's , when his old father tried in television so to be disloyal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues , without having to go too far and lose his Kabinettsjob .
Hilary 's fight was even more attractive .
But to fight in order to stay `` under all circumstances '' - Benn 's expression was not what McDonnell said , what is told JC of his comrades-in-arms and deputies , after all the Reports on their exam session on Monday evening .
What is wants to convey is always the weepy Bottom-Up Image of Corbyn - remember that he even touched me - messages-discipline in the age of TV around the clock is important and , above all , in the maelstrom of Social media , a hotbed of Paranoia and betrayal .
It is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allowed him to keep labour 's support in the referendum campaign is a matter of course , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyns basic ambiguities to the EU membership in accordance with its Bennite siege economy , its anti-capitalist past - is not only a question of esoteric discussion among the left of the dissidents , for the narcissism of the small difference is a Central tenet of dogmatic disputes .
As with its ambiguities to the Nato - Tom Watson is rock-solid convinced that JC does not start a campaign to exit will be required , and foreign diplomats to try to find meaning in everything for their superiors at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin apply political capital to waste , - you have too suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British , if this can all be meaningless ?
The US are already pretty disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and in Syria , even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in Power , what I at the Start on Monday of something that was reminiscent of what was called British Influence Security Forum .

FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team-mates must stand before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger told Wilshere , that it was only September , and if his Rehabilitation goes according to Plan , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England and given his history , his involvement in next summer at the European championship is certainly still uncertain .
The great shame in this current Problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season , according to a separate ankle injury and then found back to his old swing during the preseason had to go back .
`` This type of injury is not a threat to career , '' said Wenger .
It is a bone that did not heal well .
This is not a major issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before .
This may be from a purely medical point of view , true , but as Wenger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injury , when a player is trying , in the middle of the season to return .
It is also an unpleasant pattern developing .
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 of different diseases of Wilshere , since his debut six years ago .
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal 157 League games in the last five seasons .
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08 , one of the two Premier League Clubs that have suffered the most injury to-day .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will continue .
`` Sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time in which you strengthen your body and combat power to win , '' said Wenger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body has stabilized , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the Play against Chelsea on Saturday against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday , and Wenger is a Rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu is likely to start Debuchy and Arteta .
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
`` I try to keep the balance and the players need to take a little breather , '' said Wenger .
Although Arsenal are clear favourites , through group F , the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play areas with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe .
Dynamo is unbeaten after 41 Games , after the `` invincible '' campaign was launched in the last season .
The stadium was rocked on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , with the Richter scale , and 3.2 were measured .
This year it was the 10. in Zagreb .
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season of the Champions League capitulation against Monaco , and the remains of the distant hope , driven to lead with his Management of the club its first European Cup Triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '' said Wenger .
It worked at Arsenal .
We were in the year 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand , I 'm long enough in the business to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .

Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping

For over a decade , the virtual shopping has boomed , and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into Ghost towns .
However , experts say that there are now signs that the Online stagnate sales , after new Figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .

That will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
A rate hike is coming , and the boom will falter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
We know that .
What we do n't know is , how long will it take and how long it will last .
In particular , the story provides for economic low the instructions to the end .
A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months .
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in Raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems to respond .
Therefore , representatives of the US have stressed the Central Bank so violently that investors should focus on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather on the period of time that is needed for the normalization .
In fact , several variables play a role .
In the end , market participants may find , however , that all the excitement was exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates may .
`` The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be used by some as a Signal for the end of the Era of `` cheap money '' interpreted , '' said Julian Jessop , chief economist at Capital Economics , in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights , but still on a low level , in order to lead to the seismic shock , the fear many seem to .
This does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
Here 's a historical trend-based view of it is likely to react to , as some sectors of the economy :
As the market has in the last month seen , can make the anticipation of interest rate increases in things for a while volatile .
As soon as the increase arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
`` There seems to be a tendency that income on the assets 12 to 24 months will be stalled after the first increase , perhaps reflecting again the delay in the monetary policy , '' said Deutsche Bank analysts happened in a recent study , which increases to interest rates by the Fed .
More specifically , the market is in the last 35 years , mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest rates fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average gain of 2.6 per cent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with an average yield in the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent , according to a recent analysis , the Bob Doll , chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , Barron 's published .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the share tends to occur later in the hike cycle and the rate of return begins to decrease .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but increases in interest rates , they often promote .
In the current case , the Fed is faced with some of the conditions that existed before and which could hasten a recession .
Extremely noteworthy is that the gross domestic product will be in the vicinity of its lowest point in the case of an interest-rate increase by the Fed .
According to Deutsche Bank was one of the 118 interest rate , the nominal GDP increases since 1950 , only twice under 4.5 percent .
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , expect only a few that this will continue and expect for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed , only 1.5 percent .
Increases in interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of `` whether it is different this Time , '' said Deutsche Bank .
Market participants have made throughout the year on an interest-rate increase by the Fed in focus , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and Economists believe that the FOMC could authorize an increase in this session , the Futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
`` In our study , all of the increase in cycles from 1950 to today , in a Super-cycle took place with increasing momentum in GDP and in Front of-recession highs very soon after the beginning of the recovery in the shadow , '' the report said .
In contrast , this is a unequivocally slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed Phase .
The current cycle is by far the longest , the the Fed since the end of the last recession has been waiting for ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
The fixed income is also volatile , as the market takes an increase in interest rates is anticipated , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
The main difference is that the effect for bonds is faster than in the case of shares , if the change their strategic course .
In the case of bonds , the yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease is done in the cycle .
At the end of the increase cycle , the bond fall yields immediately , said Deutsche Bank .
The strategist of Charles Schwab , believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve .
High-yield bonds often bring in such a climate , better yields , although `` we are still careful not to expect higher yields , '' said Kathy Jones , Fixed-Income analyst at Schwab , in an analysis .
It is interesting to note , Jones says that the markets have already adapted to the Fed-strategy-expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , '' she wrote .
Short-term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , Credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market , when the Fed tightened their strategy .
All in all , companies that handle the larger part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise , local products become more attractive .
Multi-national companies with high debt are worse off , because a rising Dollar makes their products in the global market , more expensive , and as well the financing of their debt .
`` History shows that `` quality '' tend to share , three months after an initial rate increase to respond very positively to , '' said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for the customer .
Companies with a strong balance sheet companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , an average of 5 percentage points exceeded .
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in its shares also outperformed their counterparts with lower quality on average in each of 4 ( percentage points ) , and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debts become a big Problem .
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are losing the most , said Goldman .
Outside of pure share a consumer will benefit games also due to the rising Dollar .
Savers could see profits through higher yields , even if the experts are of different opinion , how quickly will this take place .

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back against rivals because of statements to the ring to fight
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has referred to criticisms of the Tackling his players as `` Agenda-Setting '' of the two Premier League favourites for the NRL .
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees fighting the Storm players `` ring in '' with his Team during the high Storm-victory in the Qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a veiled remark to the Storm Team , after his team had scored the Final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night . He called the game a `` Prime example '' of Rugby League and not `` said , that the two from Queensland were too good '' in wrestling .
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were focused on Tackling only on your `` contact us '' .
Bellamy added that the criticism from two of the leading trainers of his team him with confidence , because it meant that you were concerned to be from the Storm Team hit .
`` That appears again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke of fights on the ring , as you have us , 24:2 hit , '' said Bellamy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed throughout the year in our defensive System , or the techniques . But in the last six weeks we have made our contact in the Tackles , to a real focus , and that has provided a turning point for us in the trend .
Trent is now for three years there , and he obviously has to train a great team . He is not lose , therefore , likely to be accustomed to , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
It 's funny to show up like this again and again this Season .
Bellamy has attacked Bennett 's idea of `` exciting football '' and his Mentor , recalled that Bennett 's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 , with `` boring '' football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night , and how exciting your game , '' said Bellamy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George as a boring Team has been criticized , and Wayne said that he was going to take care of a fuck .
But now he has a Team that can play and that is what we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
This is the ball game you want to play , if you have this kind of players .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - each Team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so that you can play .
I build stronger confidence , because you say these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us play .
Six weeks ago , you have not thought well of us , when it came to the Big Games .
Bellamy also noted that the game Storm scored against the Roosters a higher result than the game Broncos against the Cowboys .
The game of the Broncos was a good game , I have n't seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18 , there were two further Attempts in our game , but it is an exciting game ?

Lamb , it was important to emphasize that `` sweet dog '' , but live , and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
Inside the house the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a hand written note that was scrawled on a white Block : `` I 'm so sorry , I wanted to , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman that loved me , ever '' . This was according to the authorities , in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
There was no indication that Lamb , who taught two Online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he has shot according to the police , a popular history Professor Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University chief of police Lynn Buford said that University employees have heard of the shooting at 10:18 PM .
He said that Lamb has made the fateful emergency call sometime after that .
Up to the end of the day , there was another death : the lamb took his own life , as the police encircled him .
A day after the shooting in the University , forcing students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are trying still to get a picture of what motivated Lamb .
The investigators at both Ends of the state published Details , as well as what students and staff who knew him have testified , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
Students said that they looked forward to his lessons .
The police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a written book , in which he mentioned the `` wonderful people '' with whom he shared his academic life .
Both taught in the Department of social Sciences and history , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students of the courses of the two .
At the same time , there were some tendencies to exhibit problematic behavior .
A Student , Brandon Beavers , praised Lamb said , he seemed a little excited and nervous , `` as if something was wrong with him . ''
Another Student , Mikel Sykes , said that lamb told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014-15 with Stress .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons and said that he had some kind of health Problem .
This year he taught only two Online courses .
Latest Changes in employment policy of the University meant that the Promotion had worked for the Lamb so hard , for him there is no guarantee for an automatic route to employment as an Assistant Professor .
University President William LaForge said , he knows nothing of a conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course there was something in Mr. lamb 's idea . ''
These are questions that can not answer Lamb .
After the escape from the Campus , the police found later , Lambs lane , when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas imports .
Before he could be arrested , killed the Lamb himself even with a .38 calibre pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile South of his parents ' house on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson .
His car was still in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people that lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began its work in 2009 , at the University , which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and pedagogy .
He received his doctorate in the spring in pedagogy .
One of the long-time Friends , Lambs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 , and the lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
You and your friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried for a few years , the guitar teaching .
At that time he was the heartthrob .
All the girls melted away when he was there , '' said Hairston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon .
Lamb and Prentiss were together for obviously some time .
In the emergency call , Lamb said , `` I killed my wife '' , but there was no certificate of marriage .
They had adjacent to a dog named Lightning , who lived with them in the brick-house on a Bayou in Gautier .
The police said that the dog was fine .
The Ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn O'steen said , you were divorced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed , and a daughter had , who was now 19 years old .
`` She was totally devastated , '' said O'Steen on his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O'Steen said he had taken a Lamb , but his daughter Abigail that he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and Blues played .
Lamb met with Prentiss , when he and Abigail , three years ago , occurred both on a summer-year market .
Later , they played together , one or other of the Gig .
O'Steen said , his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a bartender and , sometimes , entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a dimly lit Bar in the vicinity of Gautier , said that he Lamb , and Prentiss Night in the night 5 . September for the last Time saw , after Lamb , his guitar and harmonica playing stopped in front of a sparse audience had finished .
There was no indication that anything is wrong .
`` Just a happy Couple , '' he said .
We were cleaning up and joking with each other .
I mean , you both had a good sense for humor .
Schmidt , the dead Professor , was head of the freshman seminar program , and specialized in native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a Professor of English at the school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas , and was President of his fraternity and the student 's Committee .
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , about 900 people took part on Tuesday evening , including faculty , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Schmidt 's wife , Liz , and his brother , Jeff Schmidt , also attended the vigil , while the University choir `` Bright Morning Star '' and `` Amazing Grace '' sang .
The lessons will be taken on Wednesday .
`` We try to move our students to return , '' said LaForge .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying that Lamb made the call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his distress call described Prentiss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever got married .

Jewelry instead of a Curtain - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
Earlier it went to the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen to make meters .
The embroidered fabrics and lace created in large quantity for customers , which Cover , for example , and curtains that have been further processed .
This alone no longer works today , said Andreas Reinhardt , managing Director of the fashion tip in Plauen .
Instead , the Mode is again important .
In the early days of the Plauen lace fashion played a larger role , and was then supplanted by the home textile industry and is now being discovered as a niche .
Reinhardt mentions a few examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and in regional Costumes .
Even the so-called Vintage-fashion-inspired eras of past style the picture , this is a growing job potential .
Who operated in the textile industry in Germany , no niches , no longer on the market .
With us , you already make up half of all jobs .
Fashion tip member is Plauen , together with nine other companies in the industry Association Plauener lace and embroidery .
Only you are allowed to carry the protected Label .
In the last 15 years , about 80 percent of the sales were broken .
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade it is almost .
Our products reach the customer in this way .
The bulk goods are nowadays produced in Asia , much cheaper and almost exclusively on chains sold .
In addition , the Export schwächle , currently Russia and the USA .
Enough reasons , therefore , for new ways .
The industry Association is trying to score points through environmental awareness , such as Cordula Bauer of the stick pearl explains in Falkenstein : `` Since this year we carry a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and in a socially responsible manner '' .
Reinhardt adds : `` This also applies to the materials used '' .
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger foreign office of West Saxon University of Zwickau - in the faculty of applied arts , and is specialized in embroidery and lace .
Of the competition from the Asian region to oppose something , you have to find high-quality and innovative products .
It takes time and courage .
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think , especially economically , '' says Schmidt .
Therefore , an existing Design will varies often only slightly , in order to keep a customer base .
Several years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historical snow ball top .
The machine embroiders in some Places , small beads .
The Plauener gold champion Bianca hall Bach wrought-Krauße was inspired by them : `` Before , I could start with the traditional Plauener Spitze nothing '' .
Now , you used the snow-ball top for your jewelry .
In a complex process shaping the pattern in silver .
`` A lot of people in the Region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old , '' says Reuter .
It also provides in the United States , Australia , and Finland - and especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want to have a piece of memorabilia .
So I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of Plauener Spitze .

Terraced houses for refugees , Single parents , low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner building in the Franconian city of Eckental number of houses for people who do n't have a lot of money .
So for example , for refugees - but also as a Signal : `` Not only refugees in need of Wohnhraum , but also the single mother and low income earners . ''
`` I will show how one can , even today , cheap and good build , '' says the 44-Year-old in the Interview
Thousands of refugees are entering the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : It builds in a project row houses for the refugees .
Mr. Gildner , many of the refugees are entering the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The mass housing in containers , or gyms has no sustainability .
Because the people remain to a large extent here .
In view of the refugee flow , we also need in the next few decades , plenty of living space .
A simple , three-storey row house is the solution .
Gildner : A terraced house needs the least amount of space .
It facilitates the Integration .
This is different when you bring people in residential blocks .
Each of the six houses that are currently built into the pilot project consists of three residential units for each of the four asylum seekers .
Each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
It may be that many of the refugees are to say , it is peace again , I go back .
Then the houses can be converted easily according to the respective needs .
How high are the costs ?
Gildner : The price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without the land .
The is manageable .
Six months of the construction lasted .
The is appropriate .
Complicated building codes , your plans ?
Gildner : by law I have withdrawn my project correctly .
Particularly complicated it 's always , the looming sword of Damocles special construction and the Parking regulation .
Creepy .
It is always still , anyone who creates , in a row house of three apartments , one needs at least three pitches .
Only in the cities of the place .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How was the reaction of the residents for your house project ?
Gildner : There were those who accused me , to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
What definitely is not true .
But they are not increasing the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : True is : We had in the last five years , a construction boom in Germany , but luxury apartments that can barely afford a more were built .
My project has the message , even the normal people are in need of housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or low-income earners .
I show how one can , even today , cheap and good build .
That 's about it .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied micro system technology in Regensburg and initially environmental analyses .

For slightly obese diabetics weight loss surgery can be helpful .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 Diabetes can take according to a new study a minimum of five years .
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people live with Diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data require a long time to show something , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery .
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to shrink to the size of the stomach .
They reduce Hunger and the body to limit its own ability to take in food .
Over the years , obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 have proven to be Diabetes as efficiently , but most of the studies were conducted in people , the morbidly obese with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
Here you can calculate your BMI : 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , the researchers from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng General Hospital the data that you have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 Diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those who underwent this Operation , declined from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study .
Meanwhile , the BMI remained in those , the non-surgical Diabetes treatments received approximately the same at 29 .
Among those who underwent a surgical procedure , dissolved in 36 % of the Diabetes disease completely , and 28 % partially .
In the medically-treated group disbanded in comparison , the Diabetes is complete only in the case of a percent , and partially in only about two percent .
In addition , the results were at the controls of blood pressure , triglycerides and `` bad '' LDL-cholesterol `` , in General , better in the 'surgical ' group , '' found the authors .
The researchers monitored the patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c , which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
After the surgery , the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , remained stable at about 8 percent .
But this better `` glycemic control '' - not decreased as reflected in the improvement in hemoglobin A1c level - the mortality rate in five years , according to the lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared the average results for the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year of the Bypass surgery group had lost compared to the gastrectomy group , more weight ( to 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , achieved larger decreases in BMI ( 7,4 against 5.1 ) and haemoglobin A1c ( 3,1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and experienced more of a complete Overcoming of the Diabetes ( 46,9 % vs. 16.7 percent ) .
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that Operation leads to a longer life , says Blackstone , from the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix .
In the Swedish study was in obese people undergoing bariatric surgery to die is about 29 percent less likely to be in the course of 15 years , compared to a group , the more conventional methods tried .
Although the new study showed no advantage for the Survival in the surgery patients , said Blackstone , it should be reassuring for those with a BMI under 35 , who are interested in the procedure .
`` This is the critical point of this study , because it says that this Operation group is in this lower BMI-lower '' , without the increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their Doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the Patient lies with his BMI of between 27 and 30 .
`` I think that we wait too long , until we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that once you have accumulated these genetic Changes , which have associated their body with obesity and Diabetes , is a reversal of really hard . ''

Around 800 000 asylum seekers will continue to come according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the interior this year , according to Germany , according to a statement from Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) is Germany even able to a Million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated in the face of unusual challenge and determination : `` I say again and again : We can do this , and we can do this '' .
What will happen to Germany , gives the following Overview .
Be used according to different forecasts between 350000 ( as estimated by the Federal construction Ministry ) and 400000 ( estimated by the Pestel-Institute ) flats a year and the next five years .
This is almost twice as much as in the past , is built ( 250000 dwellings ) .
Dramatically , the lack of housing but especially in affordable rental properties : Year 60000 to 80000 falling out of social housing from Rent control , and particularly affordable housing will also apply to refugees .
Federal tree inisterin Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) is planning to double the funding currently 518 million to a billion euros .
Much too little from the point of view of the Pestel-Institute : 80 000 social dwellings a year would need to occur and for the Federal government to invest should have a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
Agree scientists , and Federal tree inisterin are therein , that there should also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for labour market and occupational research , it is assumed that in the long term , 55 percent of the Refugees in Germany , can be employed .
However , the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically according to their qualifications , to help you get started , writes Claudia Walter , project Manager for Integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation .
For the Integration of refugees is crucial , whether you find a job in Germany .
Work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the host society , but also for the self-esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt .
In Germany it has given , according to Thränhardt a political turn : from the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of work .
While there used to be a labour ban for asylum seekers for up to five years , this was reduced in February 2014 to three months , as well as the duty of residence , the asylum seeker to a place of residence restricted .
In the company of has - also due to the shortage of skilled workers - the majority of the view that refugees should be faster the access to the labour market .
A big hurdle for the access to the labour market lack of knowledge of the German language .
So far , there is not yet a sufficient supply of General and professional language courses .
Studies also show that the jobs to be taught most frequently through personal contacts .
The establishment of networks is therefore of the view that by Thränhardt , the Royal road to integration .
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees parents give their children in the kindergartens , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : `` For the uprooted parents , it is first of all important to keep the family together , '' says Ilya Koschembar , spokesman for the youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
The family still convince of the benefits of the nursery , and distributes the management handouts in different languages .
The demand for teachers should rise as a result of the large number of refugees that would try the Berlin Senate to increase the training capacities - for example , by allowing more trade and technical schools .
In the countries the students will be prepared without knowledge of the German language in the Welcome class to the lesson .
But they are not always aware of fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also from teachers , with only a qualification in English as a second language .
In them no defect , Beate Stoffers from Berlin 's school administration says .
The Deutsche Studentenwerk is estimated that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
In principle , no state of asylum seekers says or Tolerated the study - the only exception so far was Berlin , the Senator for the interior Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has abandoned its stance .
Studi willing refugees could be facilitated the access to higher education .
For refugees with a residence permit or toleration not receive benefits under the asylum seekers benefits act more , if you begin a course of study .
The latter do not get basically no student loans , as they fall under the circle of the bafög-entitled persons .
Tolerated refugees had to have four years in Germany lived to be Bafög-entitled from 1 . January 2016 , this margin is reduced to 15 months .
Also , this funding gap needs to be closed , ask Steffen noise , Berlin state Secretary for science , and the Deutsche Studentenwerk .
Students should immediately get Bafög .
Islam will in the future play a more important role , because many of the refugees are Muslims , and for many Religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should allow Islam to take over , with the same rights as you have , the churches , and the existing state-churches-to develop a new state-religions relationship .
Also important is the establishment of an Islamic would be welfare Association to take care of professionally to the newcomers .
To the Right also duties .
The representatives of Islam must agree on a clear point of contact and be ready with the state in many areas to cooperate and give him a certain amount of control to give options .
This also includes the willingness to courageously against religious fundamentalism .
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Aiman Mazyek , expressed on Thursday concern that religious conflicts could also be to Germany .
Those who wanted to play such conflicts in Germany , `` to have immediately forfeited your right to dwell here , in Germany , '' he said on Bavarian radio .
He suggested to translate the basic law in Arabic .
Integration in the future will be much more even than it is today , a subject of the society as a whole .
This will also need to change the majority society , is the removal of discrimination and racism are becoming more pressing .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since less than a decade , anti-discrimination , and a General equality act .
But it learns very slowly , such as the NSU murder series showed , in the police and the authorities , the racist motive is systematically ignored .
Equal opportunities for all : What migrant organisations and interest groups , non-white German long challenge and what international agreements such as the anti-racism Convention in Germany to undertake , must be in the next few years , if the country remain peaceful , and its new citizens to use their opportunities for the benefit of all .
Generally speaking , Germany was able to supply the previously expected refugees medically , says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
`` What Man - Power and capacity is concerned , we create it , '' he told the daily mirror .
However , this extra money must flow into the System .
To avoid bottlenecks , calls Montgomery , to all comers at the time of registration , health cards .
Services provided could later be the States of settled .
And in the long term , it is highly questionable that so many people with the limited catalog of FOB off by the asylum seekers benefits act provides .
Otherwise , especially with the language barriers with the Doctors to create .
In the past , the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown , migrants are informed worse about their illnesses than other patients .
Not only in clinics , in doctor 's offices , interpreters would have to be over the costs of calls for you .
Many of the refugees would be helped , but also with more General medical calls in the emergency ambulances .
And with a different diagnostic views .
Among refugee children , there is significantly more untreated disabilities , and young people to HIV awareness .
With some of the other disease pictures of German Doctors come from their training but clear , says Montgomery .
`` Parasitic infestations or tuberculosis , are not so difficult to recognize '' . And as for the shortage of Doctors , the refugees , perhaps even relief in sight .
The Syrians have a highly developed education system , many refugees were even Doctors .
To be able to practise , you must demonstrate your qualifications , and may again take exams .
At least half of the in Germany , incoming refugees , according to estimates by the Federal chamber of psychotherapists ( BPtK ) mentally ill : most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Particularly vulnerable refugee children , Dietrich Munz , President of the BPtK explained .
A recently published study of the TU Munich shows that one in every five Syrian refugee child traumatized in Germany arrives .
Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , suffers from , among other things , to the so-called Flashbacks with shortness of breath , dizziness , heart palpitations , and death anxiety .
Other symptoms of sleep - and concentration disorders , severe irritability and emotional numbness .
In order to prevent that the symptoms would chronic , early treatment is necessary , said Munz .
So far , only four percent of mentally ill refugees , however , receive psychotherapy .
Although the mentally ill , asylum-seekers can ask at the end of in the social services , a request for a psychotherapy , but the processing usually takes several months .
In addition , would decide in the social services , mostly clerks or Doctors that are not trained for mental illness , whether treatment was necessary or not .
This often leads to misperceptions , says Munz .

The BBC should EastEnders give up , says a former boss of Channel 4
The former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop to send programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice . He said that commercial rivals `` would give their right Arm '' for Hit Shows such as the Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not sent by other UK broadcasters .
He criticised the BBC for you to place public service programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial window of time against the most popular Shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4 .
After the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years during his time at Channel 4 , without success , to come up with the BBC in contact .
`` I have problems with the idea that the BBC are programs in order , or sends , which would also clearly shown of non-subsidised rivals , '' said Johnson in the house of lords communications Committee 's inquiry on the future of the BBC .
If you do n't want to keep the licence fee , which I think is in the medium or long term is a good idea , you should.its production , at least on programs that do not make others , or in order to give
Send The Voice in a first-class window of time , because you want to reach the widest possible support for their future .
The idea that no one else would , this show is a joke , it is ridiculous , it is nonsense , of course .
Johnson said : `` I can see why a regressive tax funded programs , which could also be without the subsidies .
The Voice is such a program , EastEnders is a further , admittedly , both productions .
Honestly , other channels would give their right Arm for .
I 'm trying to see how this is to be public-broadcasting .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a contractor for the series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 was head , said that the BBC is to blame for the hunting for reviews `` because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support . ''
His comments to the most popular broadcasts of the BBC 's what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , who in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell Shows such as EastEnders .
Johnson said that the more public niche programs `` should go to BBC4 , where you ca n't quite measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and you can argue , if you go to your hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of licence fee , `` Well , of course , we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen . ''
Put it in a window of time in which nobody wanted to see ever .
The licence fee Johnson told the Committee : `` I urge you to find a more regressive System , in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it .
Of course you all think , we all think that you can get for £ 150 per year , here is a great value , but for people who is for the 150 £ is a lot of money , wonder if that 's true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss , David Elstein , who testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian Mission `` to inform , to educate and to entertain '' .
He said , only a little of the BBC production would now be classified officially as an education - he said that it had 1 % of their TV-production and 0.1 % in the Radio and you should take to the public television stations in Australia and Canada is an example of this change in `` inform , educate and entertain '' .
On the question of partnerships , Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , of which he said that only a handful of shown on television and with the commercial broadcasters form alliances , to make everything available online .

Hammer artist invested three years in the personal Interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold-plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works painted by Otmar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alte post has written the introduction , and Bible texts updated .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not the Otmar-Alt-Bible , which is now published with beautiful images .
At the beginning of the image for Otmar Alt , formulated in 150 motifs in his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
Its `` language '' with bright colors and fanciful shapes has received the 75-Year-old , but they are by no means synonymous with `` funny '' pictures .
On the contrary , The respective subjects adapted to the quite grim .
About three years , Otmar has worked Old on his Bible project , for which he has a subjective , artistic choice from the many topics of the `` book of all books '' .
Created cycles dedicated to various topics , such as the stations of the cross , Plagues , commandments or our father .
So he has fascinated several partners : the Lutheran publishing house , with its theological orientation , as well as for the Kettler-Verlag , with its emphasis on art books .
And mainly because of the author Klaus Alte post , which has , on the basis of the painting with the respective passages in the Bible apart .
He has interpreted the Otmar Alt selected Bible passages and so to Today , in current contexts `` translated '' .
These lyrics are like a verbal mirror of Alts painting .
Are nestled between the Original Bible quote of Martin Luther and each of a set of the artist who formulated his own personal thoughts on the Situation .
The jewelry cover has Golden letters .
The 75 allowed-Year-old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high level of intimacy .
Emotions were at all a trigger for the Bible project : Otmar Alt , born in 1940 in Wernigerode born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Church-order .
`` Since the education happened with the cane , '' remembers Otmar Alt .
`` I tried to work through this , to tolerate me , perhaps , that with the Lord father . ''
His second concern was to help the art in fast-paced time more important : `` The perception of image worlds today is influenced by advertising , and is loud .
Symbolism is displaced .
Artists have to show a desire and delight , of things .
Images always have a bit of a Mystery and are not decorative .
`` In this regard , I 'm a dinosaur '' .
Otmar Alt would like the viewer in the images `` fall into it '' , you , discover and feel the power you have : `` looking at The picture be compared To '' .
Klaus old post confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung , `` to have always been '' a lover of Otmar Alts art : `` I like the way he conceives of his paintings to life '' .
Old did not pay attention to the Bible is complete , but the important to him , even mysterious topics selected .
`` That was n't a cooperation at eye level '' , says old post : `` Here are the pictures , the Text explains only '' . A pictures of Bible .
For Hans Möhler from the Luther-Verlag , this work is an invitation , `` to deepen his life and to find freedom '' .
Otmar Alts pictures speak for moehler in both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
A part of the original paper and canvas images will be presented for the first time in an exhibition at the 15 . November will be opened in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung .

'Sonogenetics can tax the brain cells by sound waves
The Video shows how the nematodes change direction in the Moment , in the sound pulses are irradiated .
Scientists have worms with genetically modified nervous systems bred , which can be controlled by bursts of sound waves .
The tiny nematodes change direction in the moment that you are with the sound impulses , which have for the human ear to high frequencies to be heard , to be irradiated .
The impetus to work through the Switching on of the motor neuron cells that have been genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves .
To read further on this topic : researchers and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the Power of a new procedure , called Sonogenetics , the ultrasound can be used to solve a series of brain- , heart - , and muscle-activating cells outside of the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure might one day replace Deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure , the electrical impulses in the brain of people used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Roundworms do not typically respond to ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles of air .
The blow , he found out , amplifying the ultrasonic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures , the TRP-4 ion channels and in the membranes of some of the worms cells are found .
The sound waves cause the Opening of ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , according to a report in Nature Communications .
To create ultrasound-guided cyst nematodes , changed Chalasani genetically the worms so that some of your motoneurons TRP-4-carrying ion channels .
When applying ultrasound to the changed creatures , bubbles in the sound waves by the micro-reinforced and in the worms , where you turn on to invoke the motoneurons .
The method has some Similarities with Optogenetics , a groundbreaking Tool that enables scientists , neurons with pulses of light on and off .
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
In contrast to light , which must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain down , can pass through low frequency ultrasound waves the tissue without hindrance , and can be in the brain from the top to the skull sent .
`` We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic Virus , it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound Signal in a clinical setting for specific neurological treatments , '' said Chalasani .
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and Insulin-producing cells , he added .

Metcash launches ground-employment-campaign to combat Aldi - incidence
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores in front of an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia .
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-employment-campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million Aldi-Invasion .
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first of 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengths , Metcash and IGA supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA by Mainstream Marketing and marketing through Social media , as well as through Events such as the Adelaide Show .
IGA retailers and suppliers to jump on Board , with brands such as ice-cream Simmo from Dunsborough , which is to be distributed to IGA stores , samples , and shop owners , the reduced-price Tickets for the South Australian football League to a loyal customer sale .
It is expected that Metcash further Details of his defence strategy on the 29 . Released September , when the leading wholesaler for food , alcohol and equipment of its annual investor strategy day .
There is a lot at the game , as South Australia and Western Australia , almost 30 percent of Metcashs IGA stores and higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Eastern States , generate .
Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States .
However , analysts believe , such as Morgan Stanley , Aldi will snatch twelve months after the opening of its first stores about five percent of the food market in these two States and all the existing stakeholders , but mainly independent retailers , sales will take off .
In this week according to a report published by the Analyst Tom Kierath from Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers 360 $ million in revenues per year and Metcash could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opened in the next year , 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss in the food and grocery business and at the amounts on Metcashs high fixed cost base Metcash could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr Kierath .
At the same time , Metcash loses market share in the Eastern States , mainly at Aldi and Coles , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA-buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley takes on that Metcashs sales in food and grocery business will drop to 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and to 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020 will reduce .
Last week , the leading Fund Manager Hamish Douglass , the founder of Magellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash is likely within a decade . Metcash disappear .
Metcash declined to respond publicly to the comments of Mr. Douglass .
But it is assumed that a Board has included a member of the Metcash with Mr. Douglass , last week contact .
IGAs share of the market has fallen since 2010 , from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Metcashs food and food trade , which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers , have fallen since 2012 , a 43 percent reduction in the operational debt at the same time , pressure on sales and margins reflects .
The wholesaler fights , however , and invested more than $ 150 million , in order to improve selling prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products each week to align and IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster-growing fresh food and to deliver a better selection of private Label foods .
Metcashs chief Executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and Charge-restructuring programs will increase in vigor and hopes that the large-scale return to the dealer in the year 2017 , for the first Time in four years , earnings growth .

Peter Moody claimed that Stewards were trying to spy on him and threatens to quit the racing
Peter Moody claimed that the Stewards of Racing have tried to Victoria , to install in the past year , a spy in his stables , and threatened to end the race immediately .
He aimed at the Stewards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria , and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratch of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and that he had himself found , under difficult conditions , as it went to the positive cobalt-swab sample at Lidaris , he ca n't explain .
He had held for 18 months because of the spying allegations back and did n't want it to `` look like high-hanging grapes . ''
`` I had nothing to say , and I have long been sitting on it , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , '' said Moody .
You know , it was on .
Sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I 'm going to go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to walk around head held high , and I want my owners think that I will try my Best for you .
To not think when you start , I do , then I should no longer be coach .
I must then consider what I do with my license .
Previously , Moody 's had the bomb in an Interview with racing.com high-that the integrity had been trying to Department , his Stall spy on .
`` Eighteen months ago , Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown , and Dr. Brian Stewart sat name in a room with a man - I will , if I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables , to provide information about what I 'm doing in my stables , '' said Moody on Racing.com .
You seem to believe that I 'm a fraud .
If that is the case , you should be certainly on your nose , because you have failed in the attempt to catch me .
Robert Roulston , former . The Chairman of RVL , David Moodie , President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , the current CEO of RVL , were at the time aware of and are now .
Should bring me to the view that it is personally ?
Has Fig the RVL and perhaps people outside of the coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
I 'm bad for the industry ?
I 'm so bad for the industry ?
Maybe people think out there , that I am .
Maybe you need to take me for my license and me away , and I have no doubt that what I 'm saying , can you now think about it .
But I 'm now at the point where I do n't care , and that makes me sad .
It makes me really sad .
I 'm going to put the pressure on you and push you to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The Frustration levels of the Trainers have built with the long-lasting cobalt-investigation , Lidari , and the Late Scratching led to the fact that he said that he `` could throw his license on the table . ''
Moody , best known by his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar has been described by the race day-treatment rule , `` ridiculous '' , after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse 's legs , which was contrary to the rules .
`` It is against the rules of racing .
I must take full responsibility for it , '' he said .
`` One of my staff has erroneously applied the way the mud on the leg .
It would have been yesterday evening .
It could have been yesterday all day so , what was so .
It had been there but even so , on the day of the race .
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the pack on race day . An inquiry into the matter was opened .
It is a joke .
People who establish these rules know nothing about the horse .
`` We all see that we need rules , but here you went too far , '' said Moody .

Certainly David Cameron , The Lorax knows better ?
It is a thing that all parents soon learn : If your child is a book of loves , it will not take long until you know it almost by heart .
Unless you are , perhaps , David Cameron .
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems , his favorite-to name a children 's book , decided to the Prime Minister for The Lorax , in 1971 , published in environmental fable by Dr. Seuss .
It was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the Website of the company super camps , and continues : `` funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I read to my children because it seems to always be a picture or a message that we have missed so far . ''
All well and good , except that the following paragraph , Cameron describes how , allegedly , the plot of the book , instead , a summary of the Film Version of 2012 , the new characters and Details added , to extend the rather short original text .
`` In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where all the nature is gone , and even the air is a commodity , in hopes of a Boy named Ted , to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams , he fulfilled their desire to see a real tree , '' reads one . A love interest of Dr. Seuss , whose real Name is Theodor Seuss Geisel was and died in 1991 , however , completely unknown .
As if that was n't suspicious enough of Cameron 's Text reads , in part , as the summary of the Lorax movie , which will be presented on the Website of the Internet Movie Database and so it begins : `` In the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , in hopes of a Boy named Ted , to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams . ''
Although he admits Yes , to be a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron , the plot of the book is so little acquainted . Here is an unnamed Boy , how the local environment greedy by the money stops , trees cases , the Thneed knitting Once-ler , despite the protests of the Lorax , a squat , moustached beings , `` speaks in the name of the trees '' , is devastated .
Most likely , such a relatively low PR has a delegated task to a helper that The Lorax did n't read 20 Times in a row to a child .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the Text was likely to come from Cameron 's constituency office .
Super camps confirmed that the Text was supplied by Cameron 's staff , but gave no other immediate comments .

The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the Expansion .
The managing Director of JD Sports , Peter Cowgill said that a higher minimum wage for UK workers `` could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers '' .

The cost could meet the expansion plans by JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate , Germany : Donald Trump , seen here in the campaign mode .
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a Film about Trump .
And what do the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I believe that to find the kind of exciting , but they are not impressed in your Kallstadter kind so deeply , '' says Simone Wendel .
The native Kallstädterin has turned an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring , one of which is next to Trump even the Ketchup-Heinz family .
Trump , who is not modesty , comes to `` Kings of Kallstadt '' ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would be sure to succeed , if he would live in Kallstadt .
The king of hearts he did not put it there .
Although there is respect for the power of the family , but also tend to be of the opinion that Trump was `` a bit of a loudmouth , '' says Wendel .
Random sounds of the nickname , the Kallstadt have within German , `` The brulljes makers '' - too high : the show-off , she says .

`` I ca n't imagine the Donald '' says the 68-Year-old .
You do n't think it would be better if he won the election , because `` the has not such radical views , I do n't know if this is good '' .
If those who were at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. , Say , would have been like him , `` he would have arrived there even never . ''
`` There are more interesting topics than him , '' says winemaker daughter , Sarah Buhler .
And as a President ?

Election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over Bernie Sanders cut in half in a national survey
The former US Secretary of state Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at the national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her over .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 per cent previously ) , while Sanders is in the second place , with 27 percent ( up 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , has not yet announced whether he 's running for President , gets the support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the primaries .
More than five months before the start of the primaries , say the majority of democratic voters , that it is too early to say that , in your opinion , which candidate you support .
But Clinton 's supporters are in your choice better than the other candidates .
Since the CBS News poll , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while Sanders scored a few wins .
Clinton holds a big lead among women and Moderates , but these projections have been reduced .
Your support for the men , has fallen significantly , and Sanders is only 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage among democratic voters under 50 years of age has vanished , and you and Sanders are now at the same height .
Clinton has a big advantage among the older voters .
In the past month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead for the liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group .
About half of the democratic voters in the primaries of the country say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton , if she would be nominated by the party .
A quarter would support it with some reservations and a further 15 per cent would support it only because she is the candidate .
Six percent would not support it .
Perhaps not surprising , that Clinton 's current supporters are especially enthusiastic .
The views are more mixed in the case of those who do not currently support Clinton , only about a quarter would you enthusiastically support .
While 48 percent of the democratic voters in the primaries to say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republican voters this on your top candidate Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
If Clinton 's supporters will be asked in an open question , why do you want that she is the candidate , is the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 per cent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be President ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the Job ( 10 percent ) .
Of Clinton 's supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) is mentioned .
Consent to dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited .
Since the Vice President casts a potential run for President in the pan , you want to see 57 percent of the democratic voters in the primaries him in the race , though a third believes that he should not do it .
If democratic voters in the primaries will be asked , who would be for the party their second choice , Biden is at the top .
Of Clinton 's supporters , more than half say that Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sanders .
Not Biden , to run for the democratic nomination , will increase Hillary Clinton 's lead over Sanders , of 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure of 78 per cent has fallen in the last month .
Biden is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that views him as the `` selectable '' , is increased .
Nevertheless , the question of what is a candidate key , call democratic voters questions about eligibility .
Similar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters in the primaries stands out as unacceptable .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates to provide good results in some of the most important characteristics in voters in the primaries of their party .
Majorities consider Clinton , Sanders , and Biden , as honest and trustworthy , and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Biden cuts off at the three candidates is best at honesty , while Clinton 's leadership .
Thirty percent of democratic voters believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic voters in the primaries , see generally Clinton , Sanders , and Biden is ideologically in line with their views .
In all of these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of Sanders .
Since questions about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal E-Mail address and a server during the term of office as foreign Minister , are the most Democratic voters in the primaries satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions .
But it is a different story to the American Public as a whole .
Half of Americans is now with your explanation dissatisfied , while only about one-third is satisfied .
The public opinion was in March , shortly after the Problem came to light , are cleaved .
The majority of Americans said that the E-Mail controversy had no impact on their General opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that it had worsened their opinion of her yet .
There are mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 say their views of Clinton have become worse .
Although Clinton is considered by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this is still a Problem for you , registered voters , total : Only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points since may .
62 percent of eligible voters do not hold for a honest and trustworthy Person .
At the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters of the country to see , far Trump as not honest and not trustworthy .
Clinton and Trump , however , receive good grades in leadership .
Of the six tested candidates , Carson , and Bush cut Biden , and the best at honesty .
A majority of Sanders sees more than honest , but , like Carson , many have no opinion of him .
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .

Why I have to witness an execution in Oklahoma will be
A little later today , except in the case of a late legal Intervention , I can see how a man to death .
If it happens , and I hope it happens , I 'm going to sit in a spectators gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary , when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection .
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at the time of his death .
The invitation was made already , for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day grew closer , I began to fear me .
So , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States , and there are often more applications than places available , a macabre lottery , to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
Anyone who is selected , observe it without emotion .
I ca n't do this .
I 'm going to sit next to Richard Glossips a confined friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we talk .
The prison authorities say that I ca n't be a witness and a Journalist , so it will not be allowed , a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the Details .
A Journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter , my impartiality .
Here is the lesson .
They tell the story of the detainee , as he wants it , and you get access .
I complained to her .
You admitted that you `` could have done better formulate '' , but she still thinks that it 's wrong what I 'm doing .
Richard Glossip had a Problem with some of the things I have said and written .
He says to me , what I write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international Reporter is present to write there .
If he dies , he thinks that the Publicity of this movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bellware , a reporter for the Huffington Post , is sitting next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , please stop the series of Podcasts , which I have made .
I do not want to go back to all the Details .
I ca n't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the fact .
But I think that there is a strong likelihood that he is guilty of murder .
I certainly do n't think there is enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from that perspective , I 'm going to see him die .
I ca n't claim to be really objective .
There will be other reporters , to which you can apply .
What you will get from me , is what it means to see a man in an unnecessary death .

The new laws , which became effective at midnight , in Hungary , in force , to make the Crossing of the border or the Damage of the 4-Meter ( 13 feet ) high fence by the government along the southern border to Serbia , to edify , to a crime . These laws set higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers .
`` Due to the Situation caused by the mass migration explains , the Hungarian government of the state of emergency , '' said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
We say it very clearly : Illegal border crossing is a crime .
The Parliament has to agree in terms of procedure , nor the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but a Reporter from the Associated Press to the border and heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs have already seen for days .
Gyorgy Bakondi , country security adviser for Orban , said that authorities caught 45 people while trying to cross the border , the other 15 were already penetrated deeper into the country .
You come across , by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and the Commission of offences under the new laws .
Authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .

`` Children are becoming increasingly more common to these products , and , unfortunately a percent of the lands set by you in the emergency room , '' said Lopez CNN .
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a dare in the social media .
Videos on YouTube show how young people disinfectant drink only because of a shoddy experience .
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a harder drink .
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectant .
`` A child thinks that this is bad for it , '' said Lopez .
Many of the more attractive ( Hand-sanitizer ) are the ones that are perfumed .
There is a disinfectant with strawberry , grape and orange fragrance , are great for kids , very appealing .
Hand sanitizer contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent , alcohol .
Particularly in the case of small children , a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning .
`` It is highly concentrated alcohol , '' said Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical Director of the poison centre at the hospital of the University of Kansas , the TV station Fox 4 in Kansa City .
So , you would let no SIP of Whisky standing around , but people let this Hand-sanitizer out of the reach of children , and if children come , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry scented hand sanitizer in the school , was brought in to the emergency room for treatment .
Your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that applies in the case of an adult legally considered drunk , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency room physician who treated you in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
Nhaijah slurred her words and was not able to go , as you in the emergency room arrived .
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children 's hospital for signs of brain Trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and the head had pushed , said Ritchey .
`` It was very scary , '' said Ortoria Scott , Nhaijahs mother , told CNN .
It could be for my child to be fatal .
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products , or disinfectant wipes and store hand sanitizer out of the reach of the child .
About alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants were associated with death in some cases .
In 2013 two women have died in Ontario women after the Swallowing of Hands disinfectants , which contained a toxic and undeclared ingredient .
Employees of the health authorities suspect that the product of Methanol contained a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol listed as the active ingredient .
In January , three pupils of the fourth class in the state of New York , planned to poison their `` mean '' teacher , by laying antibacterial products around the classroom '' , so it reports a police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer , and she exiled from your room .
The police looked at the foiled Plan as `` chatter '' and referred to the disciplinary action to the Board of education .

Eight Golden rules for living in halls of residence
Eleven years ago , I as a self-forgotten 19-Year old in a Dorm , still in the Faith of Berets and moral relativism , but it is only now that I remember the strained Smiles of those who I have annoyed and to the numerous , long-winded complaints about others .
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules .
The catchment in the student residences ranges from the slightly nerve-wracking to downright terrifying .
It is tempting to talk to : people tell where you come from , whether and where you the Sabbath , have taken , where they stand in relation to Corbyn and why you `` honestly Marmite neither love nor hate , because Seriously , guys , it 's just a yeast extract HAHAHA , I 'm in my room . ''
Take a deep breath .
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
It directs the conversation and helps you people find out that you like , in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were on fire , and this fire extinguisher would be .
You Can People .
The room of people transform often , drinks receptions , Film-night venues and local hangouts , but they are also the Places where people wear their underwear right now .
Related to : not remember , at University , with a relationship to start
Introverts get a rough treatment at the University .
Your room should be a refuge , but many of the student residences to form a room-to-room-shopping-culture that is friendly and social , and to lead life-long friendship .
This can be hell for someone trying to recover .
Nothing in the culture allows you to say : `` I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away , so I get the energy I 've consumed for the interaction with you . ''
You try to feel , when a fellow student of socializing is exhausted and you send him a text instead of knocking .
Speaking of waiting : Do it .
A guy in my student halls of residence had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Friends by baking .
As you start University at the height of the Baking-mania , is the Knock on the doors of people to come up with a plate full of Brownies to present less strange than the greeting of the 1950 's `` Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something . So , now please smile , if I ask you a few personal questions . ''
Homemade Treats are a good way to make friends is to offer .
Your roommate feel obligated to entertain , and will associate at the end of maybe your face with a delicious Surprise .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent Baker .
Bad lumps from flour , sugar , and fat mixed cause people to be asleep when you knocked .
To steal food , homes , a common crime in student housing .
Of course , the Mouth of chicken is a theft , but it is Taking a drop of Lactobacillus for your tea ?
Check with the dairy owner .
The chances are good that you say to support yourself , even if you cook inside .
If someone steals your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but they are trying to make a balanced deal as my roommate , the milk a detergent added , to punish thieves .
She is now in prison .
You should not make any noise , the people from sleep or work .
It 's not just about being a decent human being , but that they belong in the truest sense of the saying to the people sitting in the glass house .
A girl on my floor asked your neighbors whether you 'd mind , to Drum & Bass a bit quieter , because it 's three o'clock in the morning , and you had an exam Tomorrow .
They responded with even louder music .
When they stopped , finally , at 5 o'clock , let your neighbors in a friendly manner , sleep on it for two hours before they had their own music blaring , your door graduated and went of their three-hour examination .
It would be romantic , if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same Dorm ?
Conversely , it would not be profoundly embarrassed if you keep a roommate for your future spouse , you go for it , again disconnect and you will then have to see every day and maybe see how she pulls all the common friends to be over ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse , try to at least , to your abdomen a bit of reason to convince .
In the exciting Moment in which you notice that someone let his keys in his locked room , is the border between a joke and bullying is fine , as it seems .
A good prank is funny , but it just eyes take glances , until he becomes a boomerang .
You give by Hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but they mess it up never someone 's room with toothpaste and Shampoo .
You close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which is then set in the freezer - but you staple your possessions to the ceiling is not more than twice .

Friends : the Comedy Show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The Absence of similar representations in Shows is obvious , particularly in view of the fact , such as the need for men to open up , is now become more desperate than ever , as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year High prove .
In 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three Times more common in men than in women .
In an Effort to address the Problem , announced the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM - campaign against a pathetic life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim to make the culture in question , which prevent men from seeking help when they need it .
Friendship is the heart of the battle , to master this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 High School students with depressive symptoms found that , if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a `` healthy mood '' , his chances of recovery doubled .
For those who are not depressed , cut in half , a circle of mentally healthy friends , the risks of mental problems .
But of course you must have friends , a friendship can work .
In the age of social media-led communications , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doubled the need for a strong , fun-loving , and to appear successful , even if in reality , the Isolation dominates .
This superficial success is dominated by what is what psychologists call extrinsic values ; money , Image , social Status , all at the expense of intrinsic values - it is our inner longing for personal development and friendship , on our mental health a lot of in-depth impact .
And like a video game inventor and billionaire , said recently , money happiness ca n't buy really .
The Nice thing about Friends was that this focus was also placed on the head .
Each character was not defined by his work but by his personality , which shone through the interaction of as a friend .
The Humor of Joey and Chandler 's frequent hugs , moments when watching Football in the cozy armchairs , and the longing of Ross and Rachel - all of which came from the Knowledge that men can relate to it in any case , even if you keep often back , to fully explore their feelings .
As an employee of the Telefonseelsorge it to me said : ... `` my listener role for people who feel depressed and suicidal are at risk , has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
The men that contact us , do not often feel able to talk with friends .
The old phrase , `` I can handle it '' has come a tremendous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , if to speak about problems openly . ''
Friends is one of the Shows that comes to my mind when I try , the longer-term coping mechanisms .
You presented very clearly the little moments of male bonding .
So my objective outsider Status over the phone the people in the eyes of despair look like to help support the long term comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so , when you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friends with to celebrate the day in a completely new designed scenery , why not take your friends for a Drink in Central Perk .
Or , better yet , if you see in Starbucks , someone sitting around alone , give him a Smile and say Hello .
You never know what a difference it could make their friendship .
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the whole of the 236 episodes of # Friends

8 survey values , the show that Donald Trump should be taken seriously .
Some have tried him as a Flop .
Others have him dismissed as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to pull the Donald Trump of the top ranks in the polls below , it has not worked ( yet ) .
Ten of the last eleven national polls , Donald Trump showed double-digit lead , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate Moguls .
Of course , it is still too early in the term .
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts emphasize that to be delivered this time , in 2011 , Rick Perry 's guide to the ascendant Herman Cain , none of whom won a state in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a General election .
But outside groups like Jeb Bush 's Super PAC , and the conservative business group Club for Growth Trumps now see-through and start to make your dollars flow , to overthrow him .
Here are some of the current survey are not values that indicate that the real estate Mogul is only a temporary Phase :
Trump 's popularity ratings have turned around 180 degrees .
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , showed a poll by the Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul is positive .
Until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
And these Numbers hold in the early States .
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump .
Two-thirds of the GOP voters the GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate .
In a survey conducted by CNN/ORC last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they were either `` delighted '' or `` satisfied '' , if Trump would be nominated .
Only two out of 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they would be `` delighted '' vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump ) .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 per cent .
On the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say they are `` dissatisfied '' or `` angry '' if Jeb Bush is the favorite of the Establishment , the candidate would be .
A majority of Republicans Trumps Temperament does not see as a Problem .
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for its bombastic and offensive statements , believe 52 per cent of the to tend to the Republicans , the Irish voters that the real estate Mogul have the right Temperament for a President , ABC News/Washington Post on Monday .
The same number is in the first pre-election state of the Nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander-in-chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
However , 44 percent do not think that he had the personality to effectively be the office , and almost six out of 10 Independents say that his Temperament did not fit into the White house , so ABC/Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
When you put your Gelehrtenhüte , to keep Republican voters Trump for real .
When you are asked who will win the most the GOP nomination , say according to a poll by CNN/ORC from last week 's four out of ten , that Trump was the best bet .
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July your money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP voters the clearest crystal ball had not in the past .
To thinking at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republicans that Rick Perry would win the nomination , compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Romney , Mitt .
However , a variety of GOP voters Trumps reputation campaign as plausible .
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate , Trump beats almost everyone .
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to trump leadership , while the Anti-Trump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates , diffuse .
But a survey by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates , Trump the majority garners support .
He has Carly Fiorina a 13-point lead , ahead of Marco Rubio by 14 points , Walker with 15 points , ahead of Jeb Bush by 19 points and , finally , in front of Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 's 33 points .
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race .
A slight majority of Donald-Trump-Fans says that you have formed your opinion .
A new survey from CBS/NYT on Tuesday , shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump , say that you have awarded your votes .
Of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really tell you to never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
Nevertheless , trump 's strongest competition at the Moment , the other outsider , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say that you have formed your opinion , are twice as likely to be for Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration .
Ever since Donald Trump said in his campaign speech two months ago , immigrants from Mexico , `` rapist '' , was turning the immigration the focal point in the public discourse to 2016 .
Some are worried that the bombastic manner of expression , Trump will hold a crucial Hispano-Americans from the Republican party remote and the Neuorientierungs efforts will damage it .
But according to the new ABC/Post poll from Monday , six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump in matters of immigration .
Thus , as long as immigration stays in the spotlight , Donald Trump , apparently .
The Frustration over the government 's climb to new highs .
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson about half of the support of Republican voters now account for , especially by their outsider Status .
Six out of 10 Republicans say the new Monday survey of ABC/Post , you prefer a political outsider as someone with government experience .
And they are also angry at Washington .
A survey of the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa two weeks ago , shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans than the Republicans are frustrated in Congress , with 54 percent `` dissatisfied '' and 21 percent `` hellishly angry '' .

And electric shock rods , the agonizing cause pain , but leave no trace !
The cheerful voice and the Cartoon-pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world 's largest arms fair , is a militant parody , which was produced by Amnesty International , the willingness of the British government to bring this issue into the spotlight , to sell weapons to repressive regimes across the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London 's Docklands .

VCCP creative Director Matt Lever was astonished at the silence which reigned around , the advertising for the gun show - by-ExCeL-calendar - and thought : `` we Give you the campaign , which is trying to avoid you . ''
They played with the invention of a new , more realistic , dodgy advertising , but `` the Asking with bright colors and Animation , it is still stronger . ''
`` You have done a fantastic Job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , '' said Tom Davies of Amnesty .
What we need now is the Intervention of the British government , and the guarantee that torture devices are not traded in front of our door illegally .
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area inside of ExCeL , where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products .
In a press release , Saab revealed a new order from the U.S. army on `` the shoulder-fired AT4CS RS . ''
For this purpose , a `` uniquely shaped warhead , the outstanding Nachwirkungs effects in the interior of the target provides . ''

On their most anticipated meeting in years of the Federal Reserve to spend strategists for two days this week , around a 27-foot Honduran-mahogany table in the sitting position , in order to decide whether it is time , for the first Time in nearly a decade , raise the key interest rate .
Looming menacingly over them at one end of the ornate , two-storey meeting hall , there is a mural of the United States .
The card is a reminder that the Fed should set Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues on the economic interests of the Nation before all other things .
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from the Congress : maximize U.S. employment , and prices here are stable .
But since the great recession , the Fed 's leaders have recognised that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start , to be of the unprecedented stimulus by the near Zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 weaned .
Although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solidly , could make the recent turmoil in the global financial markets , the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to add to this volatility by raising the interest rate for Federal loans - and it was also only a quarter of a percentage point .
`` Obviously , the labour market and Inflation will be in the first line the most important thing you observe , '' said Lindsey M. Piegza , chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & co .
`` But I think , if you were not looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate , is the increased uncertainty around the global market , enough justification to continue to wait , '' she said .
There is no consensus about what will the Fed do , what is insecure in themselves the financial market .
About half of the Economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg , have said a rate increase this week before .
The financial markets expect a Wait for the Fed , a key indicator , which indicates only a 30 % Chance of an increase .
This suggests a decline in the stock market , if the Fed increases the rate , unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial jumped in average value to 228,89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16.599,85 .
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed 's policy keeps the set in this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a Surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time , '' he said .
If you do it , `` she would have to go in your statement , very far , to calm the financial markets in order to panic . ''
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm the financial markets , because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
A month ago , the Fed seemed to be well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States .
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer , that you expect this year , despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the rate .
Although job creation slowed in August , was the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and in the vicinity of the level that the Fed considers full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of a recovery .
And although Inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , said the Fed representatives that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower Oil prices .
The `` economy can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , '' said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
But the financial markets around the world flashed at the end of last month , after China had devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell in may by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow the global growth .
The market has recovered a little this month , the Dow is now up almost 10 % below the High in may .
For the Fed-representative of the market turbulence affecting the complex calculation , when should the interest rates increase .
`` If the events in the financial markets and the news would not be about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last couple of weeks , you would attract in this session , take the reins , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Central Bank .
Now he predicts that you will at least have to wait a month to get the effects .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data , describing the developments in China , '' said Oliner .
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Fed , therefore , it should not be technically involved in their decision-making .
But in the end , the Fed is a monetary authority in the world has become .
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous .
The mere note of the former head of Ben S. Bernanke in the year 2013 , that the Fed could its monetary Expansion `` narrow '' , and caused confusion around the globe .
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , can not be expected from the Fed representatives that you simply monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other Central banks , and experts advise you to get a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision-making is more art than science , `` '' said Zachary Karabell , head of global strategy for the management of the assets of the company Envestnet , Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA. , noticed this month that `` the Fed has a history of over-reaction to financial market movements , which are not associated , apparently , with the economic fundamentals . ''
Lacker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de is committed to an increase in interest rates , the quoted decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings '' , in spite of limited discernible impact on growth in the United States , '' said Lacker .
A year later , the Fed representatives made these cuts .
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the Market meltdown in 2008 in the first place , said Adam S. Posen , a former member of the Committee for interest rate setting by the Bank of England .
The recent turbulence will not come close to this level , he said .
`` You do n't want to certainly get to a Situation in which you fear a rate rise , because the markets get upset , '' said Posen , President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do n't think you should rush ahead of the time .

Experts criticize report from Public Health England about E-cigarettes
Allegations of a government-funded Agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than Smoking arose from a Meeting of 12 people , some with Connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , were joined by the Lancet , by criticizing the Public Health England ( PHE ) in its report on e-cigarettes used in evidence .
PHE has published the `` basic report '' in the last month , and describes him as a `` comprehensive Review of the evidence '' .
However , some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data in question and highlighted the Connections between some of the experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the medical journal the Lancet last month to handle the `` extremely windy '' basis , the PHE his main conclusion is justified .
Two researchers writing in the BMJ , and asked whether the statements `` build on rock or Sand '' .
Martin McKee , Professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape corrugated , Professor of Clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health strategies on the demonstration of efficacy should be based . ''
They said that the Public expects , that the claim of PHE that `` the current best estimate is that E-cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than Smoking , '' based on a detailed Review of evidence and modeling .
In fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people , were convened in order to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis ( Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis-MCDA ) to guide their opinions about the harms of nicotine-containing products of a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .

The reasons for the selection of the members of the Board are not supplied , but several well-known E-cigarette Champions , some of which also specify a industries-Finance in the paper .
Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their Expertise in tobacco control .
At the meeting , the tobacco-pipe of PHE took part .

Di Maria hits , to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmö .
Di Maria hits on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG , Malmö is the place to pull .
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were , of course , Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
Di Maria struck less than four minutes after the Start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player , brought the French champion on the way , but then they missed a number of opportunities , before they increased their lead when Cavani in the 61 . Minute , a headed goal to open the scoring .
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in group A , Paris needed a strong Start against the Swedish Champions as they strive for qualification for the knockout rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc 's Team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of goal . He was later replaced in the game against his hometown Team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career already in the year of 1999 .
`` It is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League . Therefore , it is a good Start , to win 2:0 , to cause our opponents problems and relaxed look back , even if there are certain things that we need to perfect in the course of the season , '' said Blanc .
`` This is a good sign .
We wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals . ''
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three Changes in the Paris Team , which was able to hold on the weekend was a 2:2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the League , but he was upstaged in the fourth Minute through Di Maria .
The Argentine winger has been referred to as the man , the PSG can take to the next level in Europe , as he was taken in the last month from Manchester United , and he suggested , why , when he ran into Marco Verrattis Pass in behind the Malmo defence , before he graduated to Johan Wiland over beautifully into the far corner of the net .
However , if someone believed that PSG would score a great victory , was disappointed .
Malmo , Celtic beat them in a Play-off to reach this level , competed in Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a Five-man defence and two lined up deep in the midfield , a difficult opponent .
But apart from a shot from Thorsten kinhofer , far to Kevin Trapps post in the 34 . A Minute went by , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PSG themselves were sometimes , with some misplaced passes and poor financial statements , not the least of Ibrahimovic , who bombed with no less than five attempts in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart .
Nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill , when he brought his teammates into the game , and it 's a Pass from Ibrahimovic , Di Maria turned in a turn and shot , which is of Wiland in the 52 . A Minute was drawn past the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani . The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season , after Ibrahimovic had a left-wing cross from Maxwell up fishing .
That ended all thoughts of the fact that Malmo could get back into the game , and only an excellent Intervention from Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz , was able to keep the final score low , before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end .
The coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , later admitted that PSG played a class above his Team , and the Norwegian said : `` Our last Champions League game was in December last year .
Since then , we have not only played in the Swedish League , which has the same level .
The qualification games are not enough . ''
Hats off to Paris !
It was a great game from you !

The consumer organization food watch , of a corresponding working paper of the EU , criticised the plans , sharp : `` the risks and side effects of misguided industrial policy and environmental policy are passed on with full force on Pregnant women and small children , '' said Matthias wolf Schmidt of food watch .

In return for this easing , the EU wants to tighten , according to foodwatch , the limits for other fish of currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
Food watch has described this as a `` Trick '' , because small fried fish , such as carp are mostly charged so low that you fail to comply with the proposed maximum values .
The reduction in small fish , therefore , was `` a perfidious distraction , that alone can help the economy , '' said wolf Schmidt .
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that accumulates through the food chain , especially in predatory fish .
The Federal government therefore warns against that `` even small amounts can cause in Unborn damage to the nervous system '' .
The Federal Ministry of the environment explained on its website in respect of the applicable maximum values , however , that a `` risk to health of the General population '' was not to be expected .
Mercury enters mainly through the combustion of coal in the environment .
The German coal-fired power stations emit according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of the environment , the Green of the Bundestag , Anna Lena Baerbock more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two-thirds of in Germany emitted a total amount .
The concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube had exceeded the `` permanently and extensively '' , had quoted the `` mirror '' in March , out of the paper .

According to local media , police vehicles with new refugees a meeting since then in Croatia , Tovarnik constantly .
It was mostly Syrians and Afghans , many of them women and children .
Also rescue services and the Red cross were already in use .
In the coming days , be country expect around 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the interior Ranko Ostojic .
In addition , buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border , which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border would be redirected in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
The government in Belgrade but denied she was there , the people instructing certain routes to pursue : `` Neither can we , nor do we want to do this '' , it said .
According to the media for the first Bus with about 50 refugees had to report anyway , in the Morning in the Serbian border town of Sid arrived , in the course of the day , more buses would be expected .
About Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had been all night , from around 500 miles away Macedonian border with Serbia on the way .
`` We have heard that Hungary has closed down , so we were told by the police that we are here , '' said one of the refugees .
They wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
So it might come actually to the observers already predicted a shift of the previous Balkan Route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly more westerly track .
Croatia : `` Extensive opportunities for border control ''
Croatia 's interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the case of a strong influx of refugees , plans for possible emergency situations .
The Details he mentioned , he pointed out , however , that Croatia , as a Non-Schengen-member `` comprehensive border control '' .
They perform strict checks in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia belongs to this , since 2007 , the EU-partners from the country since then , consistently a good testimony to what concerns the Standard of border controls .
On the Serbian side , approximately 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
According to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the previous night at the border crossing Horgos , leads to Röszke , .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked .

The Serbian Minister of interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried on Wednesday morning for a look at the place in Horgos to calm down : He 'll keep the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed is premature .
It would act not currently pay a very high Refugee .
One could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Helper to rates of migrants - dangerous - alternative routes

Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association , Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis earned more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and earned according to the President of the Australian tennis Association , Steve Healy more praise than criticism for its own behavior .
Kokkinakis , the youngest of the talented Duo , will always be referred to as the `` Special Ks '' , was the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters into the limelight .
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after , Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be twice separated by the referee , with Harrison exclaimed : `` Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios , and I should beat the child . ''
While he was last seen as he smashed a tennis racket after a spasm foiled a potential US Open victory with Richard Gasquet , was Kokkinakis of Healy staunchly defended .
The Teenager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against great Britain .
`` One thing that I ereifere me pretty , is the fact that , according to my view , Thanasi a little in the dispute was dragged , '' said Healy .
He has broken a racket as he lost due to a spasm in the U.S. Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a racquet out of frustration with yourself , and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is proud of it .
But , really , he behaved the same way in the US Open extremely well , even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison , and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
He has a great Team around him , he has a great family around you , and I think he was treated a little too harsh .
He is a very Mature 19-year-old , he works very hard , and he fits in the Team and so on , he has never had a Problem with the other players , he is respected in the locker area , he trains hard , he is in good Form , he is a very stable and Mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be on its own merits evaluated .
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios in the all-important preliminary , which begins on Friday , and he describes the `` joint decision '' as a right for all , but he assures the man from Canberra , as a long-term integral part of the Team to return . ''
`` First of all , we hope that the Team is completely focused on competition and not on all the Controversy around [ Kyrgios ] , '' said Healy .
And I think that Nick has very quickly managed to the rise of what people like Federer and Murray pointed out . He rises in the eyes of the Public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him , we try to make him the consequences of his actions understandable . Some time outside of the spotlight , he can only think about it , I think it is appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the Best thing for him .

Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team , but it is still hard
To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when selecting the squad , the England for the Tour , see , this is not a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card .
I would not rule out an away win .
Alastair cook 's side may be less experienced than three years ago , but there are good Spin players in the Batting lineup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will carry no scars of 2012 , a youthful , positive attitude .
With the Ball , Moeen Ali developed as a Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , is an Option for the attack .
This related message : Adam Lyth retires from the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales .
The decision of Adam Lyth to leave out , of course , is for me as a head coach in Yorkshire , and difficult to analyze .
In his seven Tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results .
There was no question mark at Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nomination , since , as I have said before - players are their own best selector .
A long time ago , you would have extended the run of Lyth , but he had control over his own destiny .
If he fails , hopefully , more runs for Yorkshire , comes one more Chance .
The England coach Trevor Bayliss is not praised his attitude , even if he rendered such good services , and that does n't surprise me ; he is above all a Team man .
The question of how much time a Test batsman to put his characters is difficult .
Lyth got seven chances - such as Sam Robson in front of him , while Nick Compton nine got .
Only Compton got a Chance to home and away games .
The only criticism one can raise , was that England Trott first began Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Lyth in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex Hales comes in , and he is a batsman that I would estimate to be high .
He is an X-factor-cricket player , what we saw in Yorkshire early this season , when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square , what struck us very much .
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him , but this of course depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea to let Moeen in addition to Cook , which would provide an Extra Spin Bowler and four Quicks get , showed up , and I do n't mind .
I do n't see why a hit man ca n't hit , and this left-hander has already shown that he is one heck of a Cricket player .
Moeen may not have done his Job for his County , Worcestershire , but he is a number 3 for you , and since there is no big difference .
My former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first Drop , before he appeared in 2001 as an Opener .
He has made three hundred Runs immediately and not looked back .
Zafar Ansari comes in the squad as Back-up Spinner , and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me as a young man , very .
People may have their stats - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the Ball - and think it is a Punt , but there is no large number of Backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth .
He will learn on this Tour a lot .
Apart from the team of England has made a couple of clever additions to the coaching staff .
The appointment of Mahlah Jayawardene , the Batsman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test matches could be a Meistercoup .
He is one of the nicest guys of the game , will bring a Wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes on for the white ball Phase of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international Cricket competition , as a player or as a Coach , and how Mahlah , he has insights from which we benefit .
Sometimes new voices can bring in the locker room fresh Wind , even if the messages are in accordance with the foregoing .
Collys team-mate at Durham , Ben Stokes , is not used in the One-Dayers , Root received a similar break against Australia and for my part , I have no Problem with it .
Some of you may not agree , but Coaches and team on the plates do not determine the schedule .
And you have to remember that , as for the players , their Jobs , the results depend on .
Such decisions are not taken lightly .

Ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their own countries is reduced .
We need to reduce the use of violence .
`` The use of violence has never solved these problems , '' he added .

According to the 11 . September , I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to the solution of this problem lies in non-violence .

Germany is supposed to be according to the will of the Federal government in the transformation of the car is a technological pioneer .
The Federal Cabinet approved on Wednesday a policy paper from the house of transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which provides for , among other things , investments in the Expansion of digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the auto show IAA of a `` new era in mobility '' .

For the testing of new technology , a test is currently being built distance on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
The rider of the `` no additional liability risks to be saddled with '' wants to check the Federal government the legal framework `` , and , where necessary , to the new developments to adapt '' .
So to use Germany , for example , at international level , the maximum allowable speed for self-driving will be raised at the end of cars from 10 to 130 kilometres an hour .
The Federal government wants to call for an Amendment to the Vienna Convention , which provides , so far , only the people as a driver .
In automated Driving , the car takes on , increasingly , the leadership , the driver is more and more to the passenger .
The technology is based on Sensors and cameras that capture the environment and the data in a matter of seconds to process .
According to the Ministry of economy submitted to the study , highly automated Driving on motorways by 2020 is technically possible .
Nevertheless , the driver can be expected lots of vehicles on public roads `` after 2020 '' .
