Stevan Hogg used phone from girl to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse .
Stevan Hogg took the girl 's phone when this slept , logging into an online messaging service from which he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user .
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg .
She saw it through , found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother .
The police took care and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered `` concerned '' web search that used terms for searching indecent images of children .
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he did it , as it would lead to `` paedophiles on the Internet '' and he then `` pretended to be a policeman to scare them . ''
The prosecutor , Eilidh Robertson , told Dundee Sheriff Court : `` He said it would be an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people .
He admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles .
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
He said he did it to lure them .
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking , and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
Ms Robertson added : `` When the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trepidation and on the wines .
She then also saw the indecent images on the phone and confrontational the defendant .
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and Playstation to speak with girls who looked much younger than him .
Hogg , 23 , of Ward Road , Dundee , pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to include indecent images of children on June 14 last year , on 25 January this year , against the conditions , and did not appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders as one could argue that `` no significant sexual element '' could be found in his offense .
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases .
He was admitted to the directory of sexual offenders before the date of the ruling .

The last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
Secret revealed ?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows , Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have been unknowingly obvious who wins The Bachelor .
The woman , at whom Sam Wood eventually landed in The bachelorette , was wrapped in greatest secrecy .
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay , Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before coming out of three two , you may have inadvertently given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until Thursday 's final
All three women have missed out on lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
However , if the question is asked `` If not you , who should get Woods last rose ? '' could become their answers to the playoff , who won the heart of the bachelor 's .
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
`` From the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah ) and Sams energies , I noticed that I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , '' said Jeavons-Fellows .
`` Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it 's so much fun to be with her , '' added Markoski .
I 've seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
From her point of view , Mackay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood could be `` the one . ''
`` As soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this was obviously not just a game - I am now unreserved to him , '' she said .
And when asked who Wood should choose , if not her , she was puzzling .
`` I do n't know if I can say that , '' she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it 's a tie between Snezana and Lana .
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m .

Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
At the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is a new medical director at Schongau Hospital .
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau .
This is due to the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Landkreis , the landlady Andrea Jochner-White confirmed .
However , a decision is made by the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will take place next Wednesday , 23 September .
If the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would be employed .
The vast majority should move with fishermen and the nearby station to Schongau .
The rooms are in place .
The staff , who can not go to Schongau , is to be offered a job in Weilheim , according to Jochner-White .
The staff were briefed on the plans .
The change was caused by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder , who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
On the question of who is to succeed , according to Jochner White , the name `` Fischer '' came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and switch with his team to Schongau .
For the house in Schongau , this means , in any case , an `` appreciation '' and a broadening of the offer in the area of `` Internal Medicine , '' according to Jochner White .
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators .
Schongau ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases .
For the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the workforce , which still has more than 35 beds , to be closed in Peißenberg after nearly 140 years .
Until now , the county had planned this for 2018 when the current clean-up at Weilheim hospital has been completed .
Landlady Jochner-White , who is also chairwoman of the supervisory board , joined rumours that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as a shelter for asylum seekers in the future .
`` I conclude that , '' as it continues with the property , Jochner White could not say there were several considerations .
At the moment there is a short time care for Caritas and a daily psychiatrics .
`` What better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , '' Fischer said about the quasi-move to the Lech , which was `` positive and very understanding '' by the staff .
A real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has worked as a chief medical officer for over 30 years , has not given up .
He was asked by Schongauer 's colleagues to take up the post of medical director .
Peißenberg 's hospital ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example , surgery and obstetrics .

BBC should abandon Eastenders , says former boss of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice , saying that commercial rivals would `` give their right arm '' for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK-Sones .
He criticised the BBC for making public programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard-pressed time windows against the most popular shows by their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4 .
After the BBC director-general , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he spent six years in his time at Channel 4 without success trying to come into contact with the BBC .
`` I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broadcast that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals , '' Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee in his inquiry on the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term , it should at least be based on programmes that others do not make or mandate .
They send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future .
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it 's ridiculous , it 's nonsense , of course .
Johnson said : `` I do n't see why a regressive tax program is funded , which could also be funded without subsidies .
The Voice is such a program , Eastenders is another , admittedly both in-house productions .
To be honest , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I am trying to see how this should be public-law television .
I do n't think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who chaired Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for valuations `` because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support . ''
His comments on the BBC 's most popular broadcasts give this back to what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows such as Eastenders .
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programs `` should go to BBC4 , where you ca n't measure the audience pretty much , but they are fulfilling their tasks , and they can argue that if they go on their seeming missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , `` Well , of course , we 've created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen . ''
They put them in a window of opportunity in which no one ever wanted to see them .
On the radio charge , Johnson told the committee : `` I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
Of course , you all think we all think you get a big value for £150 a year here , but for people who are for the £150m a lot of money , I wonder if that 's true , because they do n't consume much of the BBC .
Former Sky- and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to `` inform , educate and entertain . ''
He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 per cent of its TV production and 0.1 per cent on the radio - and it should set an example to public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this in `` inform , enlighten and entertain . ''
On the issue of partnerships , Elstein said , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online .

Who smokes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke will harm not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long-term study .
The good news : In the case of abandonment , the risk falls quickly .
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
This is based on the long-term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
Compared to non-smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely , hitting the 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher .
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants .
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DIfE .
For these periodontitis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasize the authors .
So the link between smoking and tooth decay is due to more frequent gum infections in smokers .
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk for caries .
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , the researchers wrote in the Journal of Dental Research .
However , it could take more than ten years to put the risk back to the level of non-smokers , explained Erdutor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
People need to be persuaded to become non-smokers , study leader Heiner Boeing told DIfE : `` Smoking is shortening the lifetime . ''
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health to the high age .
In Germany , over 20 percent of the population ages 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness , the DIfE said .
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure .
The new long-term study underpins the findings .

Rosberg 's only motto : Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the battle for the WMD title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton only one motto : `` Full Attack . ''
The World Cup second stressed before the start of the crucial seven overseas races , `` that I have nothing to lose . ''
53 points separate the vice-chancellor ahead of the post-split in Singapore this Sunday of defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton .
The Briton has already won seven of the previous 12 seasons and is also taking the Brisbane Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
In 2009 and last year , the 30-year-old Briton could win the race .
Whether the current smog in the city-state will influence the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear .
A dunk bell has been hanging over the city for days , triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra .

Smugglers soft on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major control points on the German-Austrian border .
Many smugglers left for fear of discovery and arrest people more at smaller border crossings
Out on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the federal police said .
Along the border River Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the counties of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday .
They were walking through bridges and dams on the German side .
There , they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration .
At Munich 's main railway station , according to Federal Police Department data , there were once again a lot more refugees in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday .
About 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
Following the reintroduction of checks on the German-Austrian border , on Tuesday , 1759 refugees had reached the city .

Croatia : `` We let the refugees through ''
`` Well , border controls are also ramping up on our southern border , '' said Interior Minister Johanna Mikltiktner .
The controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel .
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum could also make it `` self-evident . ''
People 's supply and security are paramount .
But it is also clear that it needs clear signals , '' the minister said .
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migratory flows , even over the Austrian-Slovenian border .
It takes a controlled approach .
Croatia considering 'corridor ' - Slovenia denied
The Croatian Government had previously said that Slovenia , too , wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also set up corridors for the refugees .
However , the interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see it .
The idea of corridors is `` absolutely unacceptable , '' Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary .
The border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
As the Minister pointed out , Slovenia does not want to impose its limits on refugees .
`` Every EU member has to fill out his obligations , otherwise the system can not work , '' Györkös Znidar pointed out .
As the Croatian Government pointed out , the first refugees would have tried to arrive at the Tovarnik/sid border crossing in eastern Croatia at the time of the night , in order to escape the registration .
Croatian police were able to pick them up in nearby corn fields .
According to local media , there have been regular police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian Tovarnik .
These are mainly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
Emergency services and the Red Cross are also already deployed .
In the coming days , his country will have about 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic .
In addition , buses from Presevo on the Macedonian border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diverted towards Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday .
The government in Belgrade , however , is saying that it is up to the people to adopt certain routes : `` neither can we , nor do we want to do this , '' it said .
According to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid , in the course of the day , more buses would be expected .
About Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates were travelling all night from the roughly 500-kilometer Macedonian border through Serbia .
`` We heard that Hungary had made up , so the police told us that we should go here , '' said one of the refugees .
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
This could , in fact , lead to a slightly further west end of the previous wave of observers already predicted by observers of the previous Balkan route to Turkey .
Croatia : 'comprehensive opportunities for border control '
Croatia 's interior minister , Ostojic , had previously stressed that his country was preparing for the case of a strong influx of refugees with appropriate plans for possible emergency situations .
He did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia , as a non-Schengen member , had `` comprehensive opportunities for border control . ''
Use strict controls to qualify for membership of the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have been a good witness to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
On the Serbian side , some 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence .
According to Belgrade media reports , they would have spent the previous night at the Horgos crossing , which leads to Röszke .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked .
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local witness in Horgos : He considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
There would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment .
One could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
Aid workers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia , however , is not dangerous : In parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war still not cleared mine fields .
On Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners was sent in the border region .

Xavi : PEP Guardiola prevented from switching to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
The FC Bayern clearly stood a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain 's superstar Xavi , who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time .
Eight times Spanish champions , three times postseason winners , four times Champions League winners , two times club champions , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is staggering .
In the summer , the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar .
But in an interview with the Marca , Xavi now reveals he was already ahead of Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona .
`` You told me that Barça wanted to sell me . ''
`` Madrid won everything at the time , we did nothing , '' he tells me .
And that also registered the FC Bayern .
Xavi : `` There was an offer from Bayern . ''
`` Rummenigge wanted to have me . ''
Remember : In the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern .
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did n't switch
The change , however , did not materialise .
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record master : PEP Guardiola .
Xavi explains why : `` Barça has taken Guardiola under contract and I 've played a great EM . ''
`` PEP told me that I would n't change , that he could n't imagine the team without me . ''
`` With that , he got me . ''
Who knows how Bayern 's 2008/2009 season would have run with Xavi .
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the grass , snapped the Red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the premier league triumph at the end .

Matt Damon plays diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confrontted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight , the experienced actor interrupted Brown when that emphasized the need for alternative perspectives , in reference to a black protagonist in the project 's chosen script .
`` When we talk about diversity , you do it at the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , '' Damon asserted .
Brown reacted shocked , with insulting disbelief and called `` Hoo ! WoW . Okay , '' when the actor 's comments rallied from The Martian .
Damon and Brown joined the show 's producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists .
`` I want to ask people to think about this - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , '' Brown said first .
The only black person , and she 's a nutter , beaten by her white pimp .
The producer of Dear White People campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the reigning rights to the film ; Damon replied that her directing `` in the end could give us something we do n't want . ''
After the discussion was broadcast , the social media exploded ahead of disapproval over Damon 's comments .
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing `` Matt Damon talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that 's SO WEISS that it hurts . ''
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 Likes since its release .
Damon 's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014 , the movement hit Black Lives Matter nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against Farens .
In February , the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards .
`` Album still matt , '' ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
Like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
More recently , leaders of the Movement Black Lives Matter have released a statement , in response to the issue of fox-news personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck , whether the group should be considered a hate group .
`` The network Black Lives Matter is a love group , '' the leaders said .
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers , producers and media mogule who will be invited to visit the pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West .
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear .

Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts at the company 's services .
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and its service business activities .
The expected jobless rate leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
`` These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new HewPackard Enterprise , '' said Meg Whitman , HP 's chairman and chief executive , who is to head the unit after the separation .
`` Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of deals that support companies in the transition to a new style of business , '' Whitman said .
As an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion in annual sales and `` will be focused on providing previously unmet , integrated technology solutions for companies , '' according to a statement from the company .
It divided a company founded in the 1930 '' s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric plants and whose Palo Alto garage was called `` the birthplace of Silicon Valley . ''
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
The measure of HP , the world 's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the belief that narrowly focused companies provide better performance .

Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after its move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams that sent questions after its impressive open training day at the end of last year .
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomatoes and it looks like a wise decision .
Some coaches would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a straight game as it did to the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertit at his first Punt-Return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota .
But Tomatoes trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a Punt-Return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush .
Tomatoes continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
Rather than grind his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tomatoes also boosted Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game .
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey , who advised him to forget his patchy catch and take care of the next game .
Jarryd Hayne patted at a punt that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for his NFL debut .
Hayne left the pitch after the fumble fluke and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could n't imagine a worse start to his NFL career
`` That was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that 's it , '' Hayne said .
Hayne compared the lumber with his Origin debut at the time in 2007 , when a pass in his own in-goal range led to a Try for Queensland .
Overall , however , it was a great experience for the 27-year-old .
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and post it on his Instagram .

Officials from Aich/Dob due to infidelity in court
On Wednesday , two officials from the Austrian volleyball vice-chancellor , Aich/Dob , were to be held responsible for infidelity and dismissal .
The defendants pleaded not guilty .
One of them had also been charged with abuse of power .
He has been formally acquitted of this allegation in May .
The current trial was adjourned .
According to District Attorney Robert Riffel , in the preliminary investigation , it emerged that , in 2006 to 2011 , the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to use in their functions for private purposes .
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros .
Sports officials are also charged with financial offences .
This fact left the head of the Council of Scots , Judge Michaela Sanin .
It is to be negotiated at a later date .
To dismiss the infidelity , the defense set out that the club had not created an asset afterward at any time .
Sports officials had only billed expenses and sued the sports club , for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 were around 600,000 shillings ( about 44,000 euros ) .
`` At that time , we stood in front of the situation : Do we continue or block the club ? '' he told one of the defendants , in the bread profession of the Financial Office .
With his colleague and co-defendant , he then decided to take on that task .
With all the risks .
`` We have put forward money , our life insurance as security at the bank , '' he said at concussion .
The association has been agreed : You can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made .
Furthermore , in the event of a corresponding financial success , the payment of expenses retroactive to 1991 has been decided .
As a result , some of the expenses were paid only years later , as from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
Therefore , flat and non-detailed bookings seemed to be the case , the former Obman explained the events .
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together , the second defendant said .
Why the payouts had not been fully disclosed to the club , the judge asked .
The association was not interested in the detail of financial management , important only was debt freedom , according to the response .
When , in 2011 , against an official investigation into abuse of office , an amount of €120,000 was transferred to the association 's account .
These were resignations , the defendants said .
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the club , according to its statement .
`` Why ? '' the judge wanted to know .
The respondents did not know the answer for a long time .
He eventually said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
If something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about that money , the prosecutor put in the room .
The co-accused had been informed , justified by the official .
This bank transfer has been formulated as a `` damage recovery . ''
Why claim damages ? , wanted Judge and prosecutor to know .
On that , the first defendant declared that he did not agree with that wording because the association had never been harmed .
But what should I do when the lawyer says , `` With that , you 're all out of the tailor . ''
`` Am I a legal representative ? '' he asked .
In addition , the official said he never paid a cent salary , he only billed mileage fees and diets .
On diets , he billed the club £1,000 a month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
Exact documents for the early years could not show the defendants .
These were no longer preserved after an operating audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they said .
Mileage allowance had also been referred to the second defendant .
All sticking points were made in cash , to which he would have to move from his hometown of international market to the bank to Bleiburg , he explained in his statement .
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses .

Refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary there is virtually no passing , as more and more refugees choose the road to Croatia .
Zagreb announces that there will be no hurdles to travel across Slovenia to the north .
The route is dangerous , however .
Croatia wants to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
`` I spoke to the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , '' said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
Following the isolation of the Serbian Hungarian border , there are hundreds of refugees left to Croatia in order to get to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik , the Croatian television channel RTL reports .
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the previous day .
New laws , which came into force on the same day , make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explained : `` You can go through and we are preparing for that possibility . ''
These people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
However , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
In the morning , the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia .
Most were media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
They came with both the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of Sid .
Immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
On the Croatian border , the refugees do not cross border fences .
There are other dangers for this : There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 1990s .
Mine cleaners are now expected to quickly create a safe passage .
After Hungary , however , after the closure of the border , there are little more refugees .
On Tuesday , police counted 366 recorded people .
Just before Torture on Monday , it was still 9380 .
The new Hungarian laws include overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged .
Those convicted face sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
According to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the newly established `` transseat zones '' on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - of the most important passage of Röszke .
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
On Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees there .
In practice , however , no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
According to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a `` safe third country . ''
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
Before the `` transit zone '' in Röszke , only a few hundred refugees gathered .
In Röszke , workers started to clean up .
They collected the rubbish that left tens of thousands of people on the roadside in recent weeks .
Barricades have been dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border area has been rebuilt .
No one wanted to comment on the aim of this restructuring .
Austria has only a few refugees following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
The country has also reinforced its border controls .
As a result , the 20,000 migrants were still in the country , according to government figures .
In Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
Train traffic from there to Germany was halted in the morning on the orders of German authorities .
On a regular basis , smaller groups of refugees have been found on foot .

Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season was n't particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers .
Earlier , they were once one of the best teams in baseball , today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central .
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 at Target Field .
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot .
For Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F-word that was so difficult to grasp over much of the second half of the season .
`` All the wins are fun , no matter how it comes , '' Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said .
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13-9 ) struck out 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three Runs .
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
`` I want to finish strongly this year , '' Simon said .
It 's hard to throw in the bullpen every game , and so I want to be very focused in the game .
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs , his first rbis since mid-August .
It was Martinez 's first triple hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6 .
`` He has swung the batter well , '' Ausmus said .
He looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked significantly better out of the bullpen , and he brought it straight into the game .
With three Runs in the backside at the end of the seventh innings , the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game .
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks hit a bunt , and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by the left-hander Blaine Hardy .
Hardy overran wall , the only man he faced before the presumptive rookie batter Miguel Sano , who tore the right-hander Drew Verhagen a Two-Run .
With a pair of runners and the final rally at the second , Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play .
It was that in the Major League leading 27 times this season that Plouffe suggested a double play
After Detroit added an Insurance-Run at the end of the ninth innings , Wall made an RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5-4 .
However , the right-hander stole Sano at three pitches for his fifth save .
Detroit profited to the start of the game from an even non-movable Phil Hughes .
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran , who had been dropped from the injury list before the game after missing more than a month because of a back injury .
`` Obviously not the start I wanted , '' Hughes said , `` but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning . ''
After they got in the first of the leaderboard , Halpin gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler .
A Two-Out Walk for J.D . Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game , creating a single `` up the middle '' at the first run of the game .
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 track record with the Runners in scoring position .
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right , creating another run , but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to third , which ended the threat .
The Tigers put in the second , scoring a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a Two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0 .
`` It was a big blow , '' said Twins-manager Paul Molitor .
He did n't score particularly well , but he caught the right spot .
Hughes was in a pitch-count , scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the relever right-hander A.J.Achter .
At Hughes , there were three Runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts .
Notes : Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez departed because of an injury to the throwing shoulder .
He is being investigated by Dr James Andrews , who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid-August on the injury list because of a shoulder strain , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
With Sanchez out of the game , LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins .
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 because of a tie-up in the right hip .
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris ( 2-2.4.43 ERA ) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana ( 5-4 , 4.73 )

Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement , as well as Tehran 's destabilizing measures in the Middle East .
At the meeting , however , it is also a question of the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that is being discussed .
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington criticizes Israel 's ongoing settlement construction , accusing Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process .
Through the deal brokered by Obama over Iran 's nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteriorated further .
In March , Netanyahu , at the invitation of Republicans before the U.S. Congress , delivered a controversial speech that was partly regarded as an affront to Obama .
The speech was not agreed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .

For slightly overweight diabetics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with Type 2 diabetes can take at least five years , according to a new study .
It 's too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data need a long time to show something , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a sergeant to the new study in JAMA Surgery .
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
Over the years , obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are disease-prone with a body-mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , the researchers from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they collected in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach ulcers and stomach mud - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
Meanwhile , BMI remained among those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments roughly the same at 29 .
Among those undergoing surgery , 36 % solved the diabetes disease completely and at 28 % .
In the medical-treated group , in comparison , diabetes only dissolved at one per cent and partly at only about two per cent .
In addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the triglycerides and the `` bad '' LDL cholesterol `` generally better in the 'surgical ' group , '' the authors found out .
The researchers also monitored the patient 's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
After the operation , average hemoglobin A1c levels fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
But this better `` glycemic control '' - as you are reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to veteran researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the guest rectomy group ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , reaching larger declines in BMI ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded more of a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.9 % vs. 16.7 % ) .
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Blackstone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
In the Swedish study , it was among obese people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years -- compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival among the surgeon 's patients , Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
`` This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , '' without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30 .
`` I think we wait too long before we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that once they 've collected these genetic changes that have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really hard . ''

District attorney 's office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined together under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new one-stop shop at Graf-Stauffenberg Square .
In addition to consultation , you can also participate in courses .
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
To be more precise , at the Graf-Stauffenberg Square .
A new district office has recently been opened .
Here , right next to the purchasing market , from now on , seniors and council members receive information on issues such as care insurance or services of sick and nursing homes .
For years we have been using our outpatient care service to ensure that carers are left alone .
There are an infinite number of questions .
`` Also , not often many benefits of the coffers are not used , because the complexity of the insurance industry is barely understood , '' explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand , who as a business division manager for AltenAid is also responsible for the Antonista and Citizens Hospital , as well as for the outpatient service `` Amadeus . ''
In addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
To this end , the Saludis was taken to the boat .
Therefore , you can use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment .
The offers from the senior center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way .
Saludis stands for prevention , prevention and rehab .
`` The senior center for care and care , '' explained Heike Riedel , Managing Director of Saludis .
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future indispensable .
In addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metzner ( SPD ) underscored the opening ceremonies , dedicating the district attorney 's office to the age : `` There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular sociable get-together . ''
In doing so , the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently as possible and well in their familiar environment .
The district attorney 's office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

EU Commission proposes in row over TTIP new court
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that is much more traditional in the way it works .
`` We want to establish a system that citizens trust , '' the EU commissioner , Cecilia Malmström , said in the presentation .
The Swede is proposing to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States .
The German government announced support .
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people .
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically stipulate that the EU Member States and the United States will jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court .
They are to be made to equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
For the first time , there is also a second instance .
It would allow it to appeal against verdicts .
Until now , the procedural parties agreed with each other on referees , an appeal against their sentences did not exist .
In the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and fairness .
In the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court , according to its own data .
There , for example , there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU Member States .
The investor-state arbitration procedures ( ISDS ) demanded by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
The traditional arbiters are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , over which companies claim compensation at the expense of taxpayers , erode national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
In the first statements , anti-TTIP organisations , such as Campact , described the EU Commission 's proposals as inadequate .
It has been criticised , in particular , that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CETA ) .
The German Business Secretary Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major step forward .
The Commission takes account of key points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sigmar Gabriel , has drawn up with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
The old system of private arbitration is off the table .
The French government also welcomed Malmström 's plans .
The European business association , BusinessEurope , warned against restricting the economy 's actions by too many new rules .
Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be put at a disadvantage , it was said .
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013 .
The issue of investor protection , however , has not been discussed with the US .
Originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
This date is considered to be no longer tenable .

The head of JD Sports says higher wages jeopardize expansion .
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean `` more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . ''
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company , he says .
The cost could hit JD Sports 's expansion plans , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs .

Seven 's Sunrise dominates the ratings , despite Nine 's attempts to take on the loss of leadership at the Today show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of the Liberals ' lead , but there has been no major shifts in ratings for Today .
Nine 's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott .
The rival Sunrise , with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage , was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows , including Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
This disadvantage of the deal seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise posted an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to Today 's 339,000 .
Today posted a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 317,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 283,000 ) , but its number fell short of the last Thursday ( 343,000 ) .
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months .
In August , Today averaged 318,000 compared to the 33,000 of Sunrise .
At the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
So far in September , Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at Today .
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of arrangers to the Rafters Erik Thomson .
The new drama about a recently widowed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers .
Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney .
The result last night answered this with a clear `` yes . ''
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block ( 838,000 ) and TBL Families ( 726,000 ) .
Seven had mixed results in evening two of The Chase Australia .
The first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.30 p.m. ) of the new quiz show , moderated by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers .
The second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat ( 613,000 ) .
On Monday night , the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour satte 720,000 .
Hot-Seat averages 620,000 .
The drop in the odds of the second night of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
The Chase Australia is a replacement for $ 1 million minute it did not manage to evade the McGuires show .

Boll says team and doubles start at table tennis championships
Düsseldorf wants to win the title battle from 25 September to 4 October .
The final decision is to fall no later than 22 September .
`` This is a huge loss for our team . ''
`` The guys experienced it in the morning . ''
`` We are strong enough , even without Timo to get the title , '' said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the EMC course in Düsseldorf .
At this time , Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsorship deal in China .
The 34 year-old German master is expected to return on Friday .
`` Without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , '' stated individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov .
The Hamelner , who leads the betting list in Jekaterinburg , also recalled the Euro 2013 in Schwechat .
`` At that time , Timo was also missing , and we 've become European champion . ''
`` We should be guided by this , '' declared the world number one .

No diet frenzy - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy sweet .
But those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often more likely to get away from them .
Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially Saccharose .
Healthy are the exotic fruits anyway : In them B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-cartin .
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
When buying , mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant smell .
The bowl colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very delicious .
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
Then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet food .
A mango , however , also gives hearty dishes a special note .
It alleviates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf seeds such as Chicoree and Radiccio .
And a mangochutney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and venison .

BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of Parliament criticised the station for its `` dumbing ''
He argues that he is increasingly not distinguished from commercial rivals .
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said she only imitated The Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 `` is transforming '' to Classic FM , claiming a leading member of parliament and raising new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something the private broadcaster does not do .
The Conservative MP , Andrew Bingham , also told BBC bosses that the public broadcaster was `` stupid '' and increasingly no longer different from its commercial competitors .
`` Radio 3 seems - I do n't like to use the word `` stupid '' - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , '' he said .
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which launched last December .
The BBC Music Awards , which launched last year , seem to be The Brits just under a different name .
So if you 're trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only imitate what is already on the market , '' said Mr Bingham .
BBC director-general dismissed the allegations , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness .
What I learn from Radio 3 , I wo n't learn about classical music anywhere else .
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed .
`` And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioned new works , I also really think it 's important , '' he said .
Earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it needed to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because Britons are less informed about classical music .
However , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport to replace commercial rivals on their feet .
The Tory-MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC 's musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million .
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced `` in a special BBC way . ''
He added that he wants the company to `` find a hit out of our in-house stall '' when it launches an entertainment series next time .
However , he refused to exclude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the fee payers for other entertainment formats .

Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England team , but it 's still hard
Hitting on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you look at the cadres that England have chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 Test defeat is not on my card .
I would n't rule out an upside .
Alastair Cooks 's side may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin-players in the battle line-up , and the community spirit is strong ; they wo n't wear scars from 2012 , just a youthful positive attitude .
With the ball developing Moeen Ali as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown size at Test level , is an option for the attack .
Related news : Adam Lyth drops out of the England Test cadres and is replaced by Alex Hales .
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yorkshire , hard to analyse .
In his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on outcomes .
There were no question marks at Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nomination , since - and I 've said this before - players are their own best selections .
A long time ago , it would have extended the course of Lyth , but he had control of his own destiny .
If he hopes to make further runs for Yorkshire , there is another chance .
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even though he did n't perform such good performances , and that does n't surprise me ; he 's mainly a team man .
The question of how much time a test drummer gets to set up his sign is difficult .
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine .
Only Compton got the chance to go home and out .
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in maximum form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex Hales comes in , and he 's a batting man , whom I value highly .
He 's an X Factor cricket player , what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch , which hit us very much .
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this , of course , depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of beating Moeen alongside Cook , which would provide an extra spin-off bowler and received four Quicks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I do n't see why a batter ca n't beat there , and this left-hander has already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricketer players .
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there 's no big difference .
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before appearing as an opener in 2001 .
He managed three hundred Runs immediately and did not look back .
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a back-up-spinner , and in my limited dealings with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
People may look at his stats - an average of 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a punt , but there 's not a large number of backup spiders who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Aside from the team , England have made a couple of smart additions to the coach .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the batsman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master ercoup .
He is one of the nettest guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood arrives for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mahela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind , even if the news is in line with what was previously said .
Collys teammates at Durham , Ben Stokes , will not be used at the One-Dayers , Root received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with that .
Some wo n't agree , but Coaches and team members do n't determine the schedule .
And you have to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
Such decisions are not taken lightly .

Outdoors voters are calling for the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees .
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the start of the FW Autumn column in major wallabies in the run-up to a serious crisis in Bavaria 's schools , if there is no corresponding new teacher for the many new pupils : `` We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse , '' Aiwanger said .
`` Otherwise , we will get disruption in the Bavarian education system . ''
The holiday party of the Free voters will be held in the Lower Franconian Municipality until Friday .
In fact , there were other main issues .
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Election Meeting .
`` Of course , the subject of asylum will outsource the Klausur , '' Aiwanger said .
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it did during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s .
`` So it 's not going to continue , we have to get to the causes , '' said the Free Election Chief .
Rejected asylum seekers want to push off free voters as soon as possible .
That 's why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum lawsuits : `` We also need at least 50 new asylum judges , '' Aiwanger said .
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent : `` We need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide . ''
`` Bayern pushes off , others do n't . ''
`` Because we need to become more effective . ''
But national politics in big wallabies should not fall under the table .
A long standing burner remains on the agenda : Education policy .
As for the new school year , Education Minister Ludwig Spaenle ( CSU ) , at 47 Gymnasia , launched the pilot experiment `` mid-level plus , '' in which an extension of the high school average of three is tested by three to four years - as a result , it will take nine years to go to high school .
But Aiwanger does n't go far enough .
`` The issue of G9 needs to be speeded up , '' the FW chief said .
We call for freedom of choice for all gymnasts who want this .
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired .

JVA Berlin-Tegel : Five square feet of cell are degrading
The Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex-detainee to the law enforcement agency Tegel , which had been housed in a small cell for months .
Because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
According to the judges , they can even hope for money if only a few days were locked up in the confined spaces ( Az . : 1 BvR 1127/14 ) .
As a result , an ex-detainee with his constitutional credentials was successful in Karlsruhe : He was housed in a single cell with around five square feet of ground floor between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was not separated .
After that , the man who is now back at large , according to his lawyer , has been moved to a larger cell .
His oath of office , because of the indecent prison conditions against the country of Berlin , failed .
But the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court , rejecting the case for re-examination .
You see the man 's human dignity being violated .
Chamber court now decides on level of compensation
Even if , for legal reasons , the period in question was only a few days jail days for compensation , compensation was given , it was said .
Otherwise , `` a clergyman of legal protection would be to fear the personality . ''
The chamber court now needs to clarify the amount of money .
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
So they spoke only in April to a detainee compensation because he was naked in a cell .
Degrading , according to a 2011 decision , also the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet .
In addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had documented a detainee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
The then-plaintiff was hospitalized for three months every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
Berlin 's prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of missing staff .
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly trapped for 23 hours , the aggressiveness is rising , even thugs are supposed to have arrived because of the tense situation .
According to the Department of Justice , 21 positions in Tegel are not occupied due to the lack of young people , 19 are due to disappear in 2016 .

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right ball in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven .
While this has brought the left field defender to wine and will rule him out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season .
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw collapsed into the PSV area .
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
Van Gaal said : `` He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital . ''
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
It 's horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it 's very hard and then plays fantastically , and then that happens .
In the dressing room , he had an oxygen mask on .
He was crying .
I 'm not a doctor , but if you have a double fracture , that takes six months and he wo n't play in the group stage .
I hope he can play again this season .
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee , has not punished the Mexicans .
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong .
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
It was a very serious attack with both legs .
A tweet on Shaw 's account said : `` I thank you all for your news , words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . ''
Related : Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England defender , with the European Championship in France , has an additional incentive to recover by next June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV coach , said : `` It 's a very serious injury . ''
When a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
It 's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland-team at the 2014 World Cup .
`` He 's doing very hard because it was n't his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it 's a very serious injury , that 's not good , '' Cocu said .
For me , it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction so it looked as if he [ Moreno ] had touched him , but I could n't see the attack on Luke .
Talking to SBS6 , Moreno said : `` I know how it feels , I know how hard something like this can be .
I feel very bad , and I am so sorry .
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling .

Justin Bieber in the Capital : On Bieber Expedition in Berlin

Smiling 21 years young , a hangman with an upper hand frise .
The type with the platinblond hair is 100 million euros hard .

At present , Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin .
And the generation U17 turns through .
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska .
The 15-year-old has never heard the name `` Ritz Carlton . ''
Not bad .
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday .
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland .
However , since 7 in the morning , the Polin is sitting on the cold stone plates vorm Berlin 's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz .
The Bieber-Bau : Here 's her idol , whose poster hung up in Stettin , since Monday night .
The suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much on the day as her mom Ewa earns in six months .
If anything .
The saying : `` In fact , my Wiktoria would have to sit in the 10th grade in high school . ''
`` I fulfill her a dream . ''
School duty ?
Who juts ?
The fans do n't .
Nor do Bieber himself .
In any case , it has been outspent .
For the promotion in the advertising break of the superhero , he netted three million , a second-year deal with an anti-picket company washed up many , many dollars to the Bieber account .
And with every doll that looks like him and over the counter , Bieber also cashes in .
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee , you 're amazed at the window .
He is said to have captured more than 100 million .
Some say the hype is going too far .
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally just in the US and Britain with his new single `` What do you ? '' at No . 1 .
Bieber himself , whose fourth album is due to follow in November , is not interested in the many zeros .

Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
The Austrian Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mikltiktner , stated on Tuesday evening at the Austrian television station ORF , that no one will be returned to Hungary .
Germany , too , did not return refugees to Austria .
`` No , that 's so agreed , '' she explained .
On the question of an agreement that Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mikltiktner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
She did not mention specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
In the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so-called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
Their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
The EU countries have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
The EU 's interior ministers want to take a fresh start to the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
Given the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to give more support to countries in the initial acquisition and distribution of people .
The federal government will manage this jointly with the countries , announced by Merkel late Tuesday night after nearly four-hour deliberations with the prime ministers at the chancellor 's office in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would receive it .
But if you do n't have a lead perspective , you can not stay in Germany .
This view was summed up in the round .
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a `` huge effort . ''
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometer long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
A few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that it would also shut down the border with Romania with a fence .
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking evasive routes over Romania , Hungary 's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the proposed new border fence .
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
There were initial arrests of people who had cut the fence .
In Turkey , meanwhile , eyewitness accounts said that thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border .

Pegida poster puts Lebanese on potato döner idea
Potatoes or döner ?
It goes both - in the potato döner , developed by the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay .
Inspired by the phrase `` potato rather than döner '' on a poster of the Pegida movement , Alhay potato and meat put together on a stick .
On the idea , he brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription `` potatoes instead of döner , '' which he had accidentally seen on television .
Since then , there has been a barbecue in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
`` This is Multikulti for the stomach , '' says Alhay .
The idea has now been written by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich .
It has recently been protected as a utility model , according to the authority .
So , how much meat and how much potatoes the cronies contain , Alhay does not want to betray them .
Just so much : `` It tastes better together , '' he finds .
The culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .

However , the security seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
Of the other member states , Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue .
Now that Austria , too , introduces controls at its borders , is `` a logical consequence '' of the actions of the Germans .

Four-fold increase from intake of hand disinfectants by children in last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400-percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand-disinfectants , according to the Georgia Poison Center .
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , director of the Georgia Poison Center , cases of revenue of hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12 , which report poison control centers , rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014 .
`` Children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are going in the emergency room , '' Lopez told CNN .
He said some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some are doing to impress their friends or because of a mutation in social media .
Videos on YouTube show how young people are disinfectant only because of a cheap experience .
Youths allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic oral water to get a harder drink .
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants .
`` A kid does n't think this is bad for it , '' Lopez said .
Many of the more attractive ( hand-disinfectants ) are those who are parenting .
There are disinfectants with strawberry , grapes and orange duft , which are very appealing to children .
Hanging disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol .
Especially in the case of young children , a few spritzer can lead to alcohol poisoning .
`` It 's highly concentrated alcohol , '' Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the toxic notruf Center at the University of Kansas , told the broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City .
So , you would n't let a sip of whisky go around , but people let these hand disinfectants within reach of children , and when children come to it , it 's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four spritzer from after strawberry flavored hangings in school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult legally considered drunk , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
Nhaijah lopped her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children 's hospital on signs of brain trauma since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head , Ritchey said .
`` It was very frightening , '' Ortoria Scott , Nhaijah 's mother , told CNN .
It could have been fatal for my child .
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand depressants outside the child 's reach .
Beyond alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants were associated with deaths .
In 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
Employees of health officials suspect that the product contained methanol , a lethal solution , rather than ethyl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
In January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their `` gema '' teacher by issuing antibacterial products around the classroom , according to a police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and served them out of her room .
The police regarded the failed plan as `` chatter '' and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority .

Melbourne-Storm-coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals over claims to ring fight
Melbourne-Storm-coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players ' tackling as an `` Agenda setting '' by two Premier League favorites of the NRL .
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the umpires allowed the storm-fielding players to play `` ring battles '' with his team during the High Storm rally in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the storm-team after his team scored the Final-Sieg against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night , calling the game a `` model example '' of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not `` too good '' in wrestling .
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said they were focused only on their `` contact '' at Tackling .
Bellamy added that the criticism from two leading coaches on his team gave him confidence , as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm-team .
`` That keeps coming up - I did n't hear that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when they beat us 24 : 2 , '' Bellamy said Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus , and that has provided the turnaround for us .
Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train , so he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock to him .
It 's funny how this time to come back to this time of year .
Bellamy has attacked Bennett 's idea of `` exciting football '' and reminded his mentor that Bennett 's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with `` boring '' football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday night and how exciting their game was , '' Bellamy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticised as a boring team , and Wayne said he was going to take care of a cockrower .
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
That 's the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players .
He made that statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like this .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us .
Six weeks ago , they probably did n't think of us when it came to the Big Games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS scored a higher score than the game Broncos against Cowboys .
The Broncos ' game was probably a good game , I have n't looked at it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tries in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
Or are breaks , and no points , a bit of tension ?
For me , it 's the game plans .
When they mention us , it means that we are still going to meet them at one stage .
The storm-team has been free this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the preseason finals at AAMI Park , with ticket sales starting next Tuesday morning .

FriendsFest : The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men 's friendship
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove to be at a 15-year high .
In 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
In an effort to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miseruation ( CALM - campaign against a pathetic life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they needed that .
Friendship is at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
A recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with `` healthy mood , '' his chances of recovery doubled .
For those who are not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risks of mental problems .
But , of course , you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
In the age of communication on social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lifelike and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrine values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of inconsolate values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which has a far more profound effect on our mental health .
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained , money really ca n't buy happiness .
The great thing about Friends was that this focus was placed on his head .
Each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , who was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey and Chandler 's frequent hugs , moments at the football look in cozy armchairs and the yearning of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case , even if they are often reluctant to explore entirely their feelings .
As one employee of the telephone teacher explained to me : `` my audience 's role for people who feel depressed and self-morseless , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
The old phrase `` I am coping with it '' has an enormous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems . ''
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term response mechanisms .
It clearly presents the little moments of men 's friendship .
So much my objective outsider status over the phone to people in the eye of despair may also help , the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so if you visit this weekend 's Comedy Central FriendsFest with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day , then why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk .
Or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks , give him a smile and say hello .
You never know what difference your friendship might make .
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest

Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch college newcomer
Nearly two years after a student died during a bullying ritual of a student compound in Pocono Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are filed against five people .
Members of the New York-based Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Brulik attacked Chun `` Michael '' Deng during an introduction session in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , police said .
Officials said he was charged with linked eyes with a 30-pound replica of sand filled with sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches , then fell unconscious .
Members of the Pi-DeltaPsi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became impotent and reportedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital , according to police .
However , they had the time to switch Dengs 's clothing , his symptoms to goose and Andy Meng to contact the Brotherhood 's national president to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference .
`` At this point , members began to hide Utensilien and put the welfare of the Brotherhood fundamentally over that of Michael Deng , '' police chief Wagner said .
He could not be revived , and he died the next morning of his injuries .
According to an autopsy report , Deng repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to head , hull and thigh .
`` Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood ... at least one student has been dying of harassment since 1970 every year , '' said Douglas Fierberg , a lawyer representing Deng 's family , in a statement .
Bruising and its members must be held accountable , and this move by authorities is very important .
A County grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder third-graders for the first five members .
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Meng , are also accused of bullying and forming a criminal association .
`` We do n't just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or inofficially - has sanctioned this , we will also hold them accountable , '' Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday .
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group .

Brazil 's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS is trying to explain to shocking women how important good nutrition is during breastfeeding , and is doing so with the presentation of images of babies sucking to breasts that are painted with depictions of unhealthy food .
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
Due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day .
However , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
A recent study led by Robert Waterland , a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies ' genes and protects them from developing tumors .
Unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system .

4 people killed after police shooting rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people , including a 4-year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said Wednesday .
The violence erupted Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district , about 175 miles west of the capital , Kathmandu .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , resident district officer , said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and firebombs .
MR Dhakal said police used tear gas and then shot in the air before pulling back on rubber bullets .
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used , of which it is known that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal 's southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus , who want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clashes since Oct. 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries .
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .

Serbians with $ 200,000 bail after drug deal
A man who may face a life sentence because of his attempt to get in possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on bail of $ 200,000 .
Marko Maksimovic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay , which came from South America via Vanuatu and lodged in Coomera in August .
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
Despite a possible life sentence for trying to own a commercial quantity of cocaine , Maksimovic 's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason .
The judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flanagan , was concerned about the escape danger at Maksimovic .
He has clear relations with Serbia .
He often travels to Serbia , '' he told the court Wednesday .
In the criminal case , he lied to police about his whereabouts .
Maksimov 's mother and stepfather had offered bail of $ 200,000 as security together to reach his release .
`` After reading the audacious statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of $ 200,000 is a real financial burden , '' Judge Flanagan said .
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from not appearing , he warned .
Maksimovic was released on bail , under the terms that he made his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported to the police daily , and kept to a curfew at 18 : 00-06 : 00 .

Champions League : Baylor 's dream start thanks to Müller and Idol
Two-time goalscorer in Piraeus : Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run .
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran .
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season .
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Idol have given FC Bayern a dream start to the `` Mission Milan '' in the witchbowl of Piraeus .
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their kickoff in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müllers 's double-pack ( 52nd/90+ 2 ) and Idol hits ( 89th ) earned by 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The twelfth star success in the series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardiola will finally bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt .
At his 28th match in the Champions League , Müller received friendly support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto , who made a shot of the world champion as a flanker .
`` We 're not going to underestimate them , '' Baylor captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game at the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31.688 hottest fans - and the Munich held word .
They showed a focused and dedicated idea without shining .
Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the premier class , including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United , Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin .
In 2011 , Borussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stumbled here .
But Bayern , in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated , did not want to be the next victim .
They went boldly , but they were often too unimaginative in their offensive efforts .
The attacks have been launched too often by game shift on left-hander Douglas Costa , who has rarely come through against former Zealand 's Omar Elabdellaoui .
Müller had been more lucky from the right when his flanker slipped out of the right half-field in the left upper gate .
In the 67th minute , the world champion gave up the possible 2 : 0 .
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski .
First , as Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat Poland 's headball from the line ( 26th ) .
Then by direct delivery , the goalkeeper Roberto with his knee pared ( 35 ) .
Although Bayern moved to their usual dominant game , Piraeus was able to set needle sticks .
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer , though , was leaving .
So , for example , when he steered a shot of Ideye over the latte ( 56th ) .
Before Neuer , Guardiola was allowed to defend a four-seater with David Alaba at the centre alongside Jerome Boateng , who made it good .
Mario Idol , after muscular problems back in the caddie , first sat outside .
The World Cup hero was given the green light only after the final training session , said athletic director Matthias Sammer at `` Sky '' : `` Whoever wants to make something different from this is already malignant . ''
Even at the first change , Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the troubled Lewandowski ( 59th ) .
Idols arrived late for Arturo Vidal ( 7-6 ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by Elfmeter , Müller added one more .
Before the game , it was in the stadium to tie .
After a smaller group of partially married Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and walked out with batters against the Munich supporters .
At least one Bayern-Fan was transported out of the stadium .

Why I am witnessing an executive in Oklahoma
A little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see a man being brought to death .
If it happens , and I hope it does n't happen , I will be sitting in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the toxic injection .
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day moved closer , I began to fear .
So why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US , and since there are often more applications than seats available , a macabre lottery will take place to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
Anyone who is selected will watch it emotionally .
I ca n't .
I will sit alongside Richard Glossips 's closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we speak .
The prison authorities say I ca n't be a witness and a journalist , so I wo n't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality .
Here 's the lesson .
Tell the prisoner 's story of how he wants it , and you get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she `` could have put it better , '' but she still thinks it 's wrong what I do .
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
He does n't tell me what I have to write , and I would n't do it even if he was going to do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter present to write there .
If he dies , he thinks the outreach effort will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bellware , a reporter of the Huffington Post , will sit next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts I made .
I do not want to go back to all the details .
I ca n't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed .
But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
And from that perspective , I will see him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters you can turn to .
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of an unnecessary death .

Several sports halls of the Hessen state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days .
Up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
They will then be distributed to other local authorities .
In the last ten days alone , there were 7500 people arriving in Hesse , according to the Bureau of Governors responsible for the initial shooting .
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .

Election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally , but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her on the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 percent previously ) , while Sanders is second , with 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries .
More than five months before the start of the primaries , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support .
But Clinton 's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
Since the CBS News poll , Clinton has lost among a number of demographic groups , while Sanders posted some gains .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates , but these advances have diminished .
Their support among men has fallen significantly , and Sanders is back here only with 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a big lead among older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double-digit lead at the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group .
About half of Democratic voters of the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if nominated by the party .
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate .
Six percent would not support them .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton 's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them .
While 48 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say this about their leading candidate , Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
When Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it 's time that a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Of Clinton 's supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
Consent to deal with the problems and electability are also cited .
As the vice president casts a potential for president in the wake , 57 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries want to see him in the race - although a third believe he should not .
If Democratic voters of the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Biden is at the helm .
Of Clinton 's supporters , more than half say that Biden would be their second choice well before Sanders .
If Biden decides not to run for the Democrats ' nomination , Hillary Clinton 's edge ahead of Sanders , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election ; however , that number has fallen from 78 percent last month .
Biden is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the `` most selective '' has risen .
Still , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about electability .
Like last month , not a single Democratic candidate , or potential candidate , stands out as unacceptable for these voters .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results on some important traits among voters of their party 's primaries .
Majorities regard Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities .
Biden cuts best among the three candidates in terms of honesty , while Clinton 's strength is the lead .
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do n't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say this about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do n't have an opinion of him .
Democratic voters of the primaries generally see Clinton , Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views .
For all these measurements , about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders .
Given questions about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during tenure as secretary of state , most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall .
But it 's a different story in the American public as a whole .
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their statement , while only about a third are satisfied .
Public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on her general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that her opinion of her was still deteriorating .
It 's mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have gotten worse .
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : Only 32 per cent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight per cent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
Sixty-two percent of eligible voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy .
Clinton and Trump , however , receive good marks on leadership .
Of the six candidates tested , Biden , Carson and Bush cut best in honesty .
A majority sees Sanders more than honest , but as with Carson , many have no opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .

Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe holds false speech in parliament
MR Mugabe , Africa 's oldest leader , fell from a podium down the stairs early in the year .
He remained unharmed , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
The opening of Parliament was also clouded by allegations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mugabe 's address with Buhrott .
Last month , they had ousted him and interrupted him during his speech to the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he reiterated on Tuesday .
The spokesman for the movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - MDC ) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which warned them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe 's speech .
`` The news comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title 'death ' , '' he told journalists after Mugabe 's speech .
It warns the concerned MPs that immunity ends in parliament , and once they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was `` concerned '' about the dangers to politicians .

That Viktor Orbán now sends more Zigthousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has made a high official and public opinion of the Hungarian Government 's position in the Dunstkreis of Nazism .
As a result of this policy , it is not only the Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas .
The birds , too , will have to find that the `` promised land , '' which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp .
It will be a major challenge , given the continuing influx of refugees and the approaching winter , in order to create decent conditions for those seeking protection .
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .

Europe 's refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and ripped off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , holding all the firm trying to get into the country illegally , all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants .
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man 's land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
The people who fled violence were stranded for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
But frustrations rose .
When a police helicopter hovered over them , the migrants `` opened the border ! '' and shouted insults against Hungarian riot police .
Some pointed out food and water in protest .
Serbia 's foreign minister said it was `` unacceptable '' that migrants would be sent back from Hungary , while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution rather than collateral damage .
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , '' said Ivica Dacic in Prague .
The turmoil on the ungarish-Serb border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
However , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who took refuge in the overridden Italy and Greece , and they expressed their hope that , next month or until the end of the year , an agreement would be reached that the EU states would include an additional 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent 's immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on early action from Brussels or its neighbours .
Tuesday 's emergency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto , meanwhile , said that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
In recent months , Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and has become the gateway to the European Union .
However , Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants who are looking for a better life , not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states , including Germany .
The new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4-metre ( 13 foot ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime .
`` Due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , '' government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
We say it very clearly : Illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament must still agree to the military 's use of the military , which is expected for next week , but reporters told Associated Press on the border there were heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already seen for days .
Gyorgy Bakondi , land security adviser for Orban , said that authorities told 45 people in trying to cross the border , 15 others had already invaded the country .
They come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws .
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train truck collided with barbed wire to close the borders .
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people 's data and pressed a crowd to get there .
About 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link from Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary .

FedEx earnings mixed , financial prospects cut for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its profit outlook to a full year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service .
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
At this time last year , FedEx announced that the company would want to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening Wednesday .
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May , 20 cents less than in the earlier forecast .
Analysts expected $ 10.84 , according to a survey by FactSet .
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases , which are an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages that will be charged from November .
The company said that it nevertheless expects earnings to rise above the previous year due to cost-cutting , higher revenue and because of growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company `` provides solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . ''
Plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS , which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
In the quarter that ended August 31 , FedEx earned $ 692 million , 6 percent more than last year .
Earnings per share amounted to $ 2.42 per share , just below the $ 2.44 per share that 12 of Zacks Investment Research analysts predicted .
Sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.3 billion .
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $ 12.23 billion .
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments in recent years , which brought sales in its unit Express shipments to the stash .
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground .
In the last quarter , sales at ground sports rose 29 percent , but operating income was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance .
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings decreased due to higher labor costs in the cargo business .
In premarket trading , about an hour before the opening , FedEx shares fell $ 3.85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 150.15 .
On Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .

Ben Carson moves to nationwide poll close behind Donald Trump
Ben Carson is in the latest poll from CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now account for half of the support of voters in the new poll , and others lose dramatically to stop
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide , with support growing from 23 % in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month , up 27 % in Tuesday 's poll .
But Carson shot up from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
The survey also found that Carson does well at demographic groups and surpasses Trump among Republican voters with higher education .
The rest of the field , with the exception of Carly Fiorina and compatriot Governor John Kasich , is cut off with Wis . Governor Scott Walker , who has fallen to the deepest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush , the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida-Senator Marco Rubio are up with 6 % in third place .
The error margin at the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he lands at 19 % support among Republicans , behind the Trump with 32 % support .
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson .
With a view to one in last week 's Carson , Trump found some sideshots for the former neurosurgeon , even after Carson apologized for questioning Trumps 's faith .
`` We need energy , '' Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa .

In an emergency call , Professor admits to having his girlfriend shot
In an emergency call , Professor Shannon Lamb told a slightly scratchy voice of police that he shot his girlfriend and that officers would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his `` sweet dog '' was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
Inside the house , officers found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was glued to a white block : `` I am so sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , '' which was in the letter , according to the authorities , and he was signed by Lamb .
There was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10 : 18 p.m .
He said that Lamb made the fatal distress call sometime afterwards .
By the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when police raided him .
A day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors , authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
Students said they were freaking out on his lessons .
Police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the `` wonderful people '' with whom he shared his academic life .
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
At the same time , there were some incumbents to problematic behavior .
One student , Brandon Beavers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little upset and nervous , `` as if something was wrong with him . ''
Another student , Mikel Sykes , said that lamb told him he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15 .
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for an assessment on health grounds , saying that he had any health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
The latest changes in the university 's employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not give him a guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor .
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course there was something in Mr Lambs 's idea . ''
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
After fleeing from campus , police later found Lambs lane when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents ' home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson .
His car still ran in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 residents and taught geography and pedagogy .
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring .
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game .
He was the women 's swarm at the time .
All the girls melted away when he was there , '' said Hairston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident .
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together .
In the emergency call , Lamb said `` I killed my wife , '' but there was no certificate from a marriage .
They had a dog called Lightning , who lived with them in the Backstein house , bordering on a Bayou in Gautier .
Police said the dog was OK .
Prentiss 's ex-husband , Shawn O'Steen , said they were divorced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
`` She was totally destroyed on the ground , '' O'Steen said about his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O'Steen said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer vintage market three years ago .
Later , they played together the one or another Gig .
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Shaffer , a Barker and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a weakly lit bar near Gautier , said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time , after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmonicaspiel finished in front of a sparse crowd .
There were no signs that anything was wrong .
`` Just a happy couple , '' he said .
We were on cleaning up and joking at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester training program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty , staff , students and members of the community attended a candlelight commemoration .
Schmidt 's wife , Liz , and his brother , Jeff Schmidt , also attended the memorial station , while the University-schor `` Bright Morning Star '' and `` Amazing Grace '' sang .
Classes will resume on Wednesday .
`` We 're trying to move our students to return , '' LaForge said .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Prentiss was called his wife , but there was no indication that the two were ever married .

Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It 's a mix of very big fashion show and a wax figurehead : The designer Jean Paul Gaultier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
The highlights : Storefront pucks , which are alarmingly human thanks to video projections .
They wear the French designer 's spectacular creations , among others , with Madonnas stage outfits to the great star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in skirts .
`` I ca n't say today that I 'm the Enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair . ''
`` Before it was tanned , now it 's real , '' Gaultier said .
For the visitors to the exhibition `` From the Sidewalk To The Catwalk '' ( From the pavement on the catwalk ) , which can be seen from 18 September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his first negative attitude to a show about his person .
Actually , he was against it , because : `` For me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , '' he said .
When you die , you come to the museum .
The impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
`` It 's about so much more than just beautiful clothes , '' said the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Diederen .
It is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education .
Chronologically , the show is not built , but it is a superbly choreographed overall artwork , for which a lot of effort was done : To frisk the dolls , for example , a stylist was dedicated .
14 tons of material have been mated by the makers , according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich .
Just before the start of the October festival there was a special treat : A leather chair outfit with corset .
Heidi meets Madonna .
He has always been interested in strong women ( `` women are smarter than men '' ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaultier said .
Gaultier 's old teddy is also seen in the exhibition .
He stands for the designer 's first , tentative fashionable walking attempts .
As a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his teddy BHs and clothes , Gaultier said .
With a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
Throwing fashion , he later confessed himself to himself .
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gaultier said in Munich .
Later , however , I bought it , then , of course .
For his first own fashion show , he has not been able to pay the models .
They did n't get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clams .

FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand before the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and , given his history , his involvement next summer at the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
The great shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had finished strong last season after a separate ankle injury and then recovered to his old swing during the pre-season .
`` This kind of injury does n't threaten the career , '' Wenger said .
It 's a bone that does n't heal well .
This is not a bigger issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not in touch with his ankles or with the injuries he had before .
That may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wenger also acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
It is also developing an unpleasant pattern .
The investigation by Premier Hospital Ltd recorded 23 different conditions of Wilshere since its debut six years ago .
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal 's 157 league games in the last five seasons .
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 , which has recorded the most injury days .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe an improvement in the injury rate will continue during last season .
`` Sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prospective period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , '' Wenger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabilises , I 'm confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday , and Wenger faces a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start .
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
`` I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little breather , '' Wenger said .
Although Arsenal are clear favourites , passing through Group F , the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe .
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the `` invincible '' campaign was launched last season .
The stadium was struck by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale .
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes Arsenal have drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '' Wenger said .
It has never worked out at Arsenal .
We were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I 'm long enough in the business to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .

Muslims buried in Mecca at crane accident - Bin Laden 's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia settles the collapse in part of the giant Saudic Bin-Ladel group
The Department of Health said that , in addition , a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mekka 's big moshee .
Mourners filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead joined their last trip to the Al-Moaissem-cemetery .
The funeral procession moved past the Holy See , where only days before a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the bedside .
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction over the building company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 394 injured .
The bodies of 29 mourners who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mozhee Mekkas were carried through the streets .
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was assisted .
MR Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsh in the Great Mosque .
Saudi officials have already agreed that the Haddsh will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
Today , King Salman said the Bin-Ladel group should not have stood the arm of the crane when it was not used .
An Arab version of the decree , published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin-Ladel Group was partly responsible for the collapse .
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the company 's leadership was banned from traveling abroad .
Earlier this week , Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the big mozhee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddsh , which takes place later this month .
The Bin-Ladel Group did not issue statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment .
The Royal Decree also tamed the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists .
Dozens of crows surrounded Mekka 's big moshee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin-Ladel Group .
The Bin Laden family has been affiliated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes on larger construction projects .
The late leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a breakaway son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s .
The crane 's crash came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim .
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital .
Government officials ordered that 1 million rial ( £174,000 ) to be paid to the families of those killed and the same amount of permanent casualties .
Other injuries get half that amount .

Metcash launches ground level campaign to fight Ald . incursion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches ahead of an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia .
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million Aldi invasion .
During Aldi 's opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adelaideshow .
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eishmaker Simmo from Dunsborough , distributed in IGA stores , and shopkeepers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholesaler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 per cent of Metcash 's IGA-Lade stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash 's IGA network in eastern states .
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in eastern states .
However , analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will snap out around five per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first markets , and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
According to a report published this week , analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million in sales per year and metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , and will achieve sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities at Metcash 's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr Kierath said .
At the same time , Metcash is losing market share in eastern states , mainly to Aldi and Coles , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley is assuming that Metcash 's sales in the food and food business are down 3.8 per cent in 2016 , down 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass , the founder of the Magellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass 's comments .
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week .
IGAS 's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and income from Metcash 's food and grocery store , which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
However , the wholesaler wrestles and invests more than $ 150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by rapidly growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private-Label food .
Metcash 's chief executive , Ian Morrice , says that the price adjustments and shoplifting programs will go to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .

The crowd makes it : Every two years , the automakers on the IAA show their novelties .
In 2015 , there is mainly movement in the compact cars , which are currently selling particularly well .
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand : Around 28.1 per cent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone , according to the Motor Office ( KBA ) .
This is also reflected on the IAA ( publication date 17 to 27 September ) .
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at retailers in the autumn .
`` The Astra is an extremely important model for us , '' Opel chief executive Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair .
He belongs to the core of the brand .
In order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive for this .
Opel represents an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros .
The Astra comes with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp .
In addition , the Hesse offers further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 horsepower , to which , for the first time , there are also three-cylinder liners .
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is first only as a fifth stunner .
A second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi , which can also be seen on the IAA .
And what is going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA ?
Renault Mégane : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra-competitor Mégane into the race .
At the trade fair , the Mégane is to be seen exclusively as a fifth man in a conventional and an impressive sporting GT-version .
In trade , he arrives early next year , then also as a combi .
Infiniti : Quite new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30 .
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model .
The compact Infiniti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand 's design line .
The base model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp .
However , there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 horsepower .
Suzuki Baleno : New in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
The model is offered with petrol engines , including a newly developed 1.0litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp .
The maximum torque is based on the manufacturer 's data at 170 newtonmeters ( Nm ) .
The sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : Not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen on the IAA .
On the outside , the designers of the noble Citroën-Ablegers were mainly hand in front of the front section : Here the fridge was redrawn and the changed headlights fitted with LED technology .
In the interior , the infotainment system was modernized , reducing the number of buttons through a touch screen and integrated Apple 's CarPlay for the first time .
In addition , at the IAA in the compact class , a series of revisions and new variants such as the frozen Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI .

Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold-plated ) Dornenkrone is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent images .
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
His `` language '' with colourful colours and imaginative forms has received the 75-year-old - but in no way synonymous with `` funny '' pictures .
On the contrary : Adapted to the respective subjects , that can be quite bleak .
For about three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project , for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the `` Book of all books . ''
There have been cycles that address themes such as cross paths , pranks , bids , or fatherhood .
In doing so , he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : This applies to the Lutheran publisher with its theological orientation as well as to Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
And there is , above all , the author Klaus Altepost , who has worked on the basis of painting with the respective Bible papers .
He has interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into the current context .
These lyrics are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting .
They are embedded between the original Bible treadmill by Martin Luther and a set of the artist who puts his own personal thoughts on the situation .
The jewellery band has Golden Letters .
So the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high level of intimacy .
Emotions were ultimately triggered by the Bible project : Otmar Alt , born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant missionary .
`` Because the education was already done with the cane , '' Otmar Alt recalls .
`` I tried to work that out to help me cope again with the Lord 's father . ''
His second concern is to regain the importance of art at the fastest time : `` The perception of image worlds is characterised by advertising today , and that is loud .
Symbolism is being squeezed out there .
Artists have a different desire and cheek to show things .
Pictures always have something secretive and are not decorative .
`` In this respect , I 'm a dinosaur . ''
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to `` fall in '' the images , let them look at them , discover and feel the power they have : `` The image is looking for its counterpart . ''
Klaus Altepost acknowledged Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Old Foundation , `` always '' a lover of Otmar Alts art : `` I like how he understands life with his paintings . ''
Old did not care to fully capture the Bible , but chose the most important , also mysterious themes .
`` This was not cooperation on an equal footing , '' says Altepost : `` Here we are talking about the images , the text merely explains , '' a picture Bible was created .
For Hans Möhler from Lutheran Verlag , this work is an invitation to `` deepen his life and find freedom . ''
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that opens at the Otmar-old Foundation on November 15 .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felenstausen .
We are also pleased to welcome Sammy 's Mayor Bernd Bormann , Business Development in Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert .
In many places in the country , doctors - Asendorf , on the other hand , are lucky : On 1 October , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fellowship .
While Ursel Felenstausen is retiring , her husband , Karl-Heinrich , will face his successor in the next few months with half a point .
After a remodeling period , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he invests 310000 euros into the premises at St Marcellus Road 6 .
There was a great deal of sympathy at first sight , when , before years Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll , met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll , who , for the time being , complete their medical education at the Hospital in Vermont and will also be able to enter into practice at the end of the year .
`` We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice , '' says Dr. Ursel Felenstausen and laughs .
`` When it was up , I just called them . ''
Mrs Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in Asendorf in the future .
`` The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , '' says the 39-year-old Müller .
`` We would like to meet and accompany the families over the years . ''
As an advantage , he also sees himself soon to be his own boss .
And so it was agreed , the dumpers bought the house with the practice .
However , they will continue to live in fracture Vilsen .
There , the two-time family friend , Frank Müller , also grew up , his medical school in Hanover , followed by stations in several doctors ' practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen , Nienburg and Rotenburg .
At present , he works as a senior doctor in Sulingen , and in 2009 he was ordered to become a chief medical doctor in Diepholz County , and is a volunteer in the DRK-readiness fault house Vilsen .
As of September 19 , the practice is being prepared for the new boss .
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felenstausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ursel ( internist ) has specialized in gastroenterology .
The Müllers , both internists , want to settle as family doctors .
`` Endoscopy is coming out , '' says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll .
After the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and stress EKGs and need a talk room more .
In addition , the IT system is completely renewed .
A grant of a total of EUR 50000 will receive the Müllers within the framework of a grant program from the county ( 25000 euros ) as well as from the Samtcommunity ( 12500 euros ) and the community ( $ 12500 ) .
`` This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice continues , '' notes Samtpublic 's chief executive Bernd Bormann .
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll , about 2,000 patients come to the practice field for every quarter , in the North German average practice , it is about 500 .
There is another doctor 's practice in Asendorf .
A positive side effect of the practical assumption by Frank Müller : The pharmacy remains in Asendorf , according to Ursel Felenstausen .
If no successor had been found , she would have gone , too .
Anyone who visits Müller 's speaking time will continue to look , in particular , in familiar faces : Take over the seven medical workers and the cleaners from the field .
With their departure in Asendorf , an era , after all , doctors practiced there for 30 years .
`` At the beginning we only had two rooms , '' Ursel Felenstausen shouted .
A little grumpy , after a long period of time , they have fallen .
`` But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients still often , '' the internist says .
Her husband added laughing : `` We have a 6000-square-foot plot . ''
`` So far , I 've always pushed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . ''
In addition , the couple have two grandchildren and are happy to travel .

Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by the president of Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and , according to the president of the Australian Tennis Federation , Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo , repeatedly referred to as `` Special Ks , '' came under the spotlight by the infamous clash of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters .
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon afterward , Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee , with Harrison called out : `` Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios and I should beat the kid . ''
While he was last seen as he smashed a tennis bat after a cramp failed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Groth to take second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup semi-final against Britain .
`` One thing about which I 'm quite concerned about it is the fact that after I think Thanasi was drawn a little into the dispute , '' Healy said .
He has broken a racket when he lost because of a cramp in the US Open , but he is not the first player to have broken a racket out of frustration with himself , and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , really , he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open , even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
He 's got a great team around , he 's got a great family around , and I think he 's been treated a little too strictly .
He 's a very mature 19-year-old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in the locker room , he 's trained hard , he 's good in form , he 's a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the `` joint decision '' as the right one for everyone , but he secures the man from Canberra as a long-term fixture to return to the team . ''
`` First , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies surrounding [ Kyrgios ] , '' Healy said .
And I think that , in the eyes of the people like Federer and Murray , he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we are trying to support him , we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions , some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .

`` It 's impossible that everyone can come to Europe '' - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not include all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East .
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
He demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
He also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable , but the situation was not appropriate .
`` It 's impossible that everyone can come to Europe , '' he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany 's and Austria 's efforts to address the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
`` To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long-term solutions , like a real peace and real development , mainly through education , to be created for these Muslim countries , '' he insisted .
Ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
We must reduce the use of force .
`` The use of force has never solved these problems , '' he added .
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence , and also commented on George Bush 's actions after the terrorist attack on Sept. 11 and turned out that the U.S. 's violent response drew a chain of uncontrollable events .
After 11 September , I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence .
`` I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , '' the Dalai Lama said .

Refugees need shelter : Study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense .
More and more refugees are seeking an affordable lead .
The pressure on the housing market is growing .
Social housing is facing a challenge .
Distribution campaigns in the German housing market have long since begun .
With the coming refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities .
They compete with low-income citizens around the last affordable homes .
To meet demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association of `` social-housing . ''
By comparison , this year , 260,000 units are ready in Germany .
As a result , 140,000 homes are missing .
After the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial residence .
Many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long snakes in front of the rental flats .
According to the Federal Statistical Office , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
However , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees .
The study also makes significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting down a housing deficit , which is increasing from year to year .
Currently , some 77,000 accommodation units have already been missing in the conurbations , complains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
Many professionals lived in WG rooms in large cities .
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the `` Hotel Mama '' because of the slack in the housing market .
In the big cities , the number of square feet per capita has declined for the first time in recent years .
To solve the problem , the alliance `` Social Housing '' suggests a reboot .
In doing so , new incentives are expected to boost social housing .
Thus , the basic income tax could be waived and the land tax for subsidised homes will be suspended .
Moreover , according to the Alliance , attractive tax incentives are needed .
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the state bank KfW is already doing well in towns and cities .
A good week after it was launched on Monday evening with EUR 184 million , more than half of the EUR 300 million available had been called up .
Now , the project could even be topped up .

Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to end the racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
He targeted the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment , the final straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what was best for racing and he was finding himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt tuck test at Lidaris , which he can not explain .
He had been restrained for 18 months because of the espionage charges and did not want it to `` look like high-hanging grapes . ''
`` I had nothing to say about this and I 've sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you 're so frustrated that everything comes out at once , '' Moody said .
You know that it went on .
Sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I 'll go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk down the main street , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
If they start thinking I do n't , then I should n't be more coaches .
I then have to consider what I do with my license .
Earlier , Moody had ramped up the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on its stall .
`` Twenty months ago , Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I was asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables , '' Moody said at Racing.com .
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster .
If that is the case , they should certainly catch their noses because they have failed in trying to catch me .
Robert Roulette , chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of the RVL , were aware of this at the time , and are still today .
Should this make me think that it will be personal ?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people outside trainers responsible for what 's going on in the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I so bad for the industry ?
Maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
Maybe they 'll have to take my license and violate me , and I have no doubt that what I 'm saying , they 're now thinking about it .
But I 've now got to the point where I do n't care , and that makes me sad .
That makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The coach 's frustration levels have been set up with the long-running Kobalt investigation at Lidari , and the Late Scratching led to the fact that he said he `` could throw his license across the table . ''
Moody , best known by his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar , called the race day treatment rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horseman , which violated the rules .
`` It 's against the rules of racing .
I have to take full responsibility for that , '' he said .
`` One of my staff mistakenly applied mud to the leg .
It could have been last night .
It could have been the whole day the whole day , which was the way it was .
But it also had it so on race day .
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day , an investigation into this matter has been opened .
It 's a joke .
People who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
`` We all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , '' Moody said .

This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
An interest rate rise is coming , and the domestic bill will falter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
We know that .
What we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will last .
In particular , history provides little guidance for the economy .
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and took 86 months .
The Federal Reserve 's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial assets react .
As a result , representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normalisation .
In fact , several variables play a role .
In the end , however , market participants might find that all the fuss about a rate hike may have been exaggerated .
`` The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of `` cheap money , '' '' said Julian Jessop , chief economist at Capital Economics , in a note to clients .
By contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
However , that does not mean there will be no impact .
Here 's a look based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy might react :
As the market has seen last month , the anticipation of interest-rate hikes can make things more volatile for a while .
Once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
`` There appears to be a tendency for asset sales to abate 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , '' said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed 's rate hikes .
More accurately , the market in the past 35 years has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent , according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll , chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , at Barron 's .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the rate of return will begin to decrease .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but interest-rate hikes often encourage them .
In the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
What is most remarkable here is that gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in a Fed rate hike .
According to Deutsche Bank , at the rate of 118 interest rates since 1950 , only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 % .
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 per cent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed .
Interest-rate hikes on such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of `` whether it 's different this time , '' Deutsche Bank said .
Market participants have been caught on an interest-rate hike by the Fed all year , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session , futures trading gives only a 25 percent probability .
`` In our study , all increase in the rate of growth from 1950 to present in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre-receptacles very quickly after the start of the recovery , '' the report concluded .
By contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
Fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in equities if they change their strategic course .
On bonds , the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction takes place in the cycle .
At the end of the increase cycle , bond yields fall immediately , Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Schwab 's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds to be closer together and lead to a draining of the curve .
High-interest bonds often yield better returns in such a climate , though `` we are still cautious about expecting higher yields , '' said Kathy Jones , fixed-income analyst at Schwab , in an analysis .
It is interesting , according to Jones , that markets have already adjusted to Fed-strategy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , '' she wrote .
Short-term interest rates have risen , the earning curve is flat , credit ratings have expanded and volatility has risen - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy .
At large , companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market , as well as financing their debt .
`` History shows that `` quality '' shares tend to react exceedingly positively three months after an initial rate hike , '' Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the customers .
Companies with a strong balance sheet have surpassed companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , averaging 5 percentage points .
Companies with high capital yields as well as low volatility in their shares also transferred their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debt is going to be a big problem .
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Goldman said .
Outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
Savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts disagree on how quickly that will take place .

Lia-Peroni-holder opened second business in the arcade
In the new shop , Furla-handbags are at the centre .
In fact , Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog .
This project had to be curled up by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the dog-market arcade : After all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business local .
At the Furla-Shop opposite the business in which it sells bags , suitcases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , it is now all about women 's handbags of the Furla brand , money markets are from 75 euros .
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
It has been rebuilt for several weeks .
`` I have long considered , however , whether I should still open a store , '' says Breit .
The key to the decision was , among other things , that the Furla producers , who are at home in Bologna , were taken away from the idea of their own location , where only their handbags were sold .
`` We are the only ones in the greater Linz that sell this brand , '' says the mother of two daughters , who himself has Italian roots .
Her fashion interest has received Breit from her mother in the cradle .
I get the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
Why some women find themselves at the sight of a nice handbag in adornment , the specialist woman can not answer with the last safety .
Maybe it 's because a nice bag of every outfit looks up .

The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose residents are called solicitors .
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
Whether he expresses xenophobic , journalists are concerned about or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency is cracking down on the campaign .
And performs well .
This is also registered in the bearded Kallstadt , where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from .
The New Yorker with the conciliatory is many in the Winzerdorf on the wine road .
Some in the 1200-square-foot place is over -ten corners with him .
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate : Donald Trump , here in campaign mode .
Kalltown 's Simone Wendel turned a film about Trump .
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I think this is somehow exciting , but they are not so impressed in their Kallstadter style , '' says Simone Wendel .
The native Kalltown has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprinters , to which alongside Trump also counts the Ketchup family Heinz .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , is also coming to terms in `` Kings of Kallstadt '' ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he were to live in Kallstadt .
To the king of hearts , he did n't bring it there .
While there is respect for the family 's performance , they also tend to believe that Trump is `` already a bit of a big maul , '' Wendel says .
Coincidentally loud the nickname , the Kallstadt in the perimeter , `` The Brulljesmacher '' - to high German : The Angers , she says .
So Trump is coming out of the village of the solicitors .
The Trump 's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold diggers in the US .
Foundations of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York .
But the lives of the grandparents were not free of tragedy : Their desire to return to the homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Palatinate belonged at the time .
He did not include Trump because he was once held off without a permit , the director of the Institute for Forgotten History and Folk , Roland Paul , said at the film launch .
Trump is the grandson of an `` illegal immigrant . ''
This contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descendant .
It had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
`` Like the pole , this is not so sympathetic , '' says Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant relative of Trumps ( `` The grandma was a born Trump , the grandpa was born Heinz '' ) .
The grower , in retirement , looks more distanced from the Americans , `` he 's always so upbeat . ''
Does he think Trump is coming ?
`` I ca n't imagine that , '' says the 72-year-old .
`` He never bothered about Kallstadt . ''
The pension owner Veronika Schramm , like some Kallstadter , mentioned that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something to the church organ during a visit , which is generally good .
`` I ca n't imagine that from Donald , '' the 68-year-old says .
It would be better if he did not contest the election , because `` who has such radical views , I do n't know if that 's good . ''
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the US had been like him , `` he would never have arrived there . ''
`` There are more interesting issues than him , '' says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler .
And as president ?
`` My president is n't , '' she says .
And , `` the grapes will also be ripe without the President Trump . ''
Wendel 's film , for which Trump has long been interviewed , has seen 12 000 cinematographers , including in the US wakes up interest .

Glencore collects $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
The mining giant Glencore , based in Switzerland , which is hit by one-day commodity prices , raised $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt-reduction plan .
London registered company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt .
The company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices as China 's economic downturn hits demand and wreaks havoc on markets .
The issue of subscription rights brought down Glencore 's share price at trading early Wednesday morning , a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
The stock jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index , which opened 0.69 per cent higher .
Glencore last week announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to pay off about a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
The company sold the new holdings to 125 pence per share , representing a 2.4-percent discount on Tuesday 's closing price .
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 per cent of the group .
Concerns about long-term depressed growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have dropped by 20 to 40 percent .

XI urged to open the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open more broadly to the outside world to promote growth , President Xi Jinping said Tuesday of a group tasked with steering reform .
`` China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving the strategies for business start-ups , '' he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central leadership group for deepening a comprehensive reform .
Encouraging new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , Xi said .
The leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border control policies , support the state-owned enterprises ( SOE ) , to borrow private capital , and overhaul the single-person reporting system .
According to the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
The initiative is significant because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources , ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
The government will also loosen controls over the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
As part of a bid to open state-controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
`` The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them , '' the statement said .
In addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the `` Green Card '' by optimising the requirements and making the application process easier .
Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosecutors , was also discussed at a meeting .
The meeting also included Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .

Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep !
The ads shameful Britain 's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Messenger video watch .
Terrible mob drones !
Footballing shattered blizzards !
Cluster bombs !
And electric shock rods that cause agonizing pain but leave no trace !
The happy voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world 's biggest arms trade fair is a combative parody , produced by Amnesty International , to lobby the British government 's willingness to put weapons to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London 's Docklands .

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains and which require a second look .
`` Important announcement : Drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR ? '' ( Docklands Light Railway ) reads in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLRLine , which converts to the image of a tank .
In September , a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR will ask customers to help stop the arms trade .
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the museum for gruesome designs in Banksys Dismaland .
A collective with the name Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used `` Ad Space Hack Packs , '' a £6 pack from Inbusturnkey , which claims that `` access to around a third of bus station advertising space on the planet . ''
Transport for London finds this poster `` vandalism '' not funny .
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group .
After Gavin Grindon , curator of Crueol Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries .
Many artists work with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to move outside to the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
Another of the anti-gun tape posters greeting the commuters on the subway .
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , which works non-profit with the graphic designer and Voiceover artist who also works for free .
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence that reigned around advertising for the arms trade fair - through a vacancy of the ExCeL-calendar - and thought : `` give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . ''
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertisement , but `` through the concussion with bright colors and animation , it stays stronger . ''
`` They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal resale devices at the fair , '' says Tom Davies of Amnesty .
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not acting illegally on our doorstep .
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL , where exhibitors are scouring fantastically euphemistic products .
In a press release , Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army over `` the AT4CS RS . ''
This includes a `` uniquely formed battlefield head that delivers outstanding follow-up effects inside the target . ''

Eight golden rules for life in student homes
Eleven years ago , I moved as a self-forgotten 19-year-old to a student residence , still in faith in Berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I was annoyed - and to the numerous , long-suffering complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules .
The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nerve-wracking up to absolutely terrifying .
It 's tempting to smile : People tell you where you come from , whether and where you 've taken Sabbath year , where you are in reference to Corbyn and why you `` honestly have Marmite neither love nor hate , because in earnest , guys , it 's just a yeast extract hahaha , I 'm in my room . ''
Breathe through .
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
It distracts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like , unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers .
Leave people .
People 's rooms are often transformed into beverage recipes , film night venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people put themselves in and turn their underwear .
Related : Do n't think about starting at university with a relationship
Introverts received rough treatment at the university .
Your room should be a refuge , but many student homes form a space shuttle culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship .
That can be hell for someone trying to recover .
Nothing in culture allows you to say , `` I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so I get the energy I used to interact with you . ''
Try to feel when a commitone of conviviality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking .
Speaking to knock on : Do it .
One guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Friendship close by baking .
As you start the university at the peak of the Back-mania , the Klopfen is on the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies , less strange than greeting the 1950-year-old `` Welcome to the neighborhood , I 've baked something to you , so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . ''
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
Her fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and , in the end , perhaps associate your face with a tasty surprise .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
Badly missing clumps of flour , sugar and fat mean that people are sleeping when you knock .
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes .
Of course , the clawing of chicken is a theft , but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
Check that with the milk owner .
The odds are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside .
If someone steals your stuff , that 's annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my co-workers , who added their milk a sink to punish thieves .
She is now in prison .
They should not make noise that prevents people from sleep or from work .
It 's not just about being a decent person , but that in the truest sense of the word you belong to the people sitting in the glass house .
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors whether it made them feel a little quieter , drum & bass , because it was three o'clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
They responded with even more tepid music .
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m. , they kindly allowed their neighbours to sleep two hours before crashing their own music , closed their door and went to their three-hour test .
Would n't it be romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same student residence ?
Conversely , would n't it be abysmal embarrassing if you keep a co-worker for your future spouse , ranting at her , rebounding herself and then seeing her every day and perhaps witnessing how she wanders all common friends ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co-worker definitely is n't your future spouse , try at least to give your underbelly a little sanity .
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room , the border between an Ulk and bullying is finer than it seems .
A good stint is funny , but it only takes moments before he becomes a boomerang .
Teach by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but do n't look at someone 's room with toothpaste and shampoo .
Shut her door , and put her keys in a glass of water , which then put you in the freezer - but punches her possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .

Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The local councillor Bernried approved the construction application for the EUR 2.3 million sports hall .
And he made an exception .
The roof may be flat for solar panels .
The plans for the long-awaited turnaround construction at the Bernrieder Sports Area are moving forward step by step : In the recent local council meeting , the prepared construction application was unanimously approved without much discussion .
Previously , the panel had decided , among other things , a request for a construction legal `` exemption '' from the current development plan .
In the case of the `` exception , '' permission was granted for a special form in relation to roof construction .
Thus , a `` saddle-roof with non-common first and roof stand '' is to be built .
Background of planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar panels : `` By doing this we get a wonderfully large southern roof together , '' Mayor Josef Steigenberger said in the meeting .
For the sake of `` liberation , '' it was supposed to be among ten degrees , for energetic reasons , other than in the development plan .
The volume of the hall will be significantly reduced .
A `` liberation '' was necessary because the development plan for the roof of the roof does not allow for `` exceptions '' - with the Bernrieder council usually more restrictive in the case of libertarians .
At Turnbull building , however , it is not a recurring project : `` We do n't create a precedent , '' according to Steigenberger .
The gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bernried .
Around 2.3 million euros are calculated at a cost .
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports support .
In the next step of the procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the Landratet for examination .

Munich , Sylt and Co. : The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
In the street , a square meter of a rectory house costs an average of 73,300 euros .
`` On Sylt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , '' said the study - hence the high price .
A new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most .
Of course , 18.70 euros per square meter for a student bude in Munich are not really little .
Unlike Germany 's top residents , one of the price is like peanuts .
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square metres prices at sky-high altitudes .
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square metre , of course .
But , well , who can afford it
By the way : Munich , for once , is not at the top .

Pound rises by accelerating wage growth in the UK
The pound rose briskly after data showing a rise in the UK 's wage growth , while at the same time the FTSE 100 was boosted by bidding at SABMiller .
Between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.9 % over the same period last year .
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and made assessments on the timing of an interest rate increase .
The pound rose by more than 1 per cent against the dollar to $ 1,5505 and was up 0.84 per cent against the euro to €1.3730 .
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49 % to 6,229.21 .
SABMiller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after takeover offer from rival AB InBev .
A transaction would combine the world 's two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser , Stella Artois , Peroni and Grolsch .

Jewellery rather than Gardine - chatter top as fashion niche
It used to be on the long embroidery machines in and around talking about making meters .
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , for example , to distribute them to blankets and curtains .
This alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Reinhardt , Managing Director of Modespenter .
Instead , fashion is important again .
In the early days of the talking tip , fashion played a bigger role , then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt mentions some examples : Tip in jewelry , with accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
At all , the so-called vintage fashion , which appeals to past Stilepochen , is an increase in order potential .
Those who do not use niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
With us , they already account for half of all orders .
Together with nine other companies , Modespende is a member of the industry association of Plauener Top and Stickereien .
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
Some 80 per cent of sales have been broken in the last 15 years .
Private trade deals , as well as the wholesale trade , almost no longer exist .
Our products hardly reach customers in this way .
The bulk goods are made much cheaper in Asia today and almost exclusively distributed via chains .
Moreover , exports are weakening , according to Russia and the US .
So there are enough reasons for new paths .
The industry association is also trying to score through environmental awareness , as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein : `` Since this year we have been conducting a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable . ''
Reinhardt added : `` This also refers to the materials used . ''
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg outsider of the Westphalian University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroideries and tips .
To counter the competition from Asia , you need to find high-quality and innovative products .
That takes time and courage .
There is an area of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that , above all , have to think economically , '' says Schmidt .
Therefore , an existing design is often slightly different to keep a customer base .
A few years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball .
In some places , the machine stifles small kisses .
The chatter goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krough was inspired by this : `` Before , I could n't do anything with traditional chatter . ''
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry .
In an elaborate procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver .
`` A lot of people in the region identify with the subject of talking tip - young and old , '' Reuter says .
It also supplies to the U.S. , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in chat and surroundings and who want a souvenir .
With that , I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the talking tip .

Project Hieve : Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday settlement of the Small Sea at Emden take shape .
The investor first unveiled public plans for the project .
A number of residents are still worried - they fear the sellout of their recreational fugitives
For months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , grated , debated and drawn .
Now , the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea are near Emden on the table .
The interested , the medium-sized Emder company `` System-Bau , '' presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council .
Originally , this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda .
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDA group that preached the investors and the administration , Ralf Behrend of the System-Bau-management board went on the offensive : `` We do not yet have an answer to all questions , '' he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors .
But it 's good to be able to meet all the rumors now .
The project , which is around ten to twelve million euros , has been under discussion for months .
Fierce reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting called the images and new details to the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , Meerbust 's owner and board member at the advocacy group 's advocacy group , Pro Hieve , is suing : `` This is going to be a giant clotting that surprised everyone else . ''
He also fears like many other project critics that traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase sharply : `` There must be full bus charges so that it expects , '' according to Schulz
However , what is happening on the good one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
There is still no operator .
`` First we have to have a coherent concept , '' said Ralf Behrend .
Because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable .

Internet sales rose at the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for that
In the first three months of 2015 , there was a seven per cent increase in online sales .
Last month was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
Experts believe the Black Friday in November has slowed spending
For over a decade , virtual shopping has drilled , and many of Britain 's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed just seven per cent in the first three months of 2015 .
Total spending for August represented the lowest rise in growth since records began in 2000 , with only five per cent increase over the previous year .
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed just seven per cent growth in the first three months of 2015
`` If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always evolved over time , '' said Andy Mulcahy , editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian .
He explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
It meant more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa .
But now this is shifting , and we may see that growth is diminishing .
The black-friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for declining sales .
Experts believe buyers will withhold their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
Last year , five times the average number of buyers scrambled around their computers to make their bargains , and some vendor websites crashed .
Experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers are battling for bargains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of £5 spending , a little more than £1 was spent online .
With some products such as televisions and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now done via web shops .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .

B & Q Boss says that the era of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen , says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind
As a result , 200 more Screwfix stores , aimed at artisans , will open
At the same time , Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner , City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons are laying down their hammers and brush in favor of using qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
If you can deal with a hammer or a brush to remove walls , you seem to be in a minority today .
Because Britons increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out pet jobs in their homes , according to the head of the company behind B & Q .
Véronique Laury , new chief executive of Kingfisher , which owns the tree-lined chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offers services to low prices , is now outdated .
That 's why Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores that cater to tradesmen and close 60 outlets of B & Q .
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B & Qshops , because eight out of 10 purchase decisions in the store are taken by women .
At the moment , the employees outweigh the men .
She said it was necessary to confront the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past .
Mrs Laury said : `` It still works by a majority of men in our branches .
We need to shift this closer to a balance .
Basically , half of our customers from women are 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
Women play a major role in the decision-making process .
Mrs Laury , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FTSE100 index , has also surrounded her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in senior positions .
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mrs Laury said : `` This was a deliberate decision - diversity is an important issue here .
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
Kingfisher reported a drop in half-year profit and moves after the group owed the cost of closing the stores .
Because of the trend , Kingfisher , the Screwfix and B & Q , will open 200 new stores .

8 poll results showing that Donald Trump is serious .
Some have tried to brand him as a flop .
Others dismissed him as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks at polls down , it ( still ) did n't work .
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump in the double-digit lead , and some are starting to get serious about what it means for the odds of the Real Estate 's nomination .
Of course , it is too early in the parliamentary term .
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry 's leadership was delivered to the rising Herman Cain , none of which won only one state in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps staying power and starting to let their dollars flow to topple him .
Here are some recent poll numbers suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase :
Trumps 's approval ratings have turned around 180 degrees .
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a poll by Monmouth-University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive .
By mid-July , it was 40 percent .
In early August , it was 52 percent .
Now , six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion .
And those numbers keep in early states .
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump .
Two-thirds of GOP-voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates .
In a CNN/ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they were either `` thrilled '' or `` satisfied '' if Trump was nominated .
Only two out of 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they would be `` thrilled '' vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump ) .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
On the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be `` dissatisfied '' or `` upset '' if Jeb Bush , the establishment 's favorite , would be the candidate .
A majority of Republicans do n't see Trumps temperament as a problem .
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and abusive statements , 52 percent of the Republican-leaning Irish voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president , according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday .
The same figure applies in the nation 's first pre-election state , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
Still , 44 percent think he does n't have the personality to effectively execute his office , and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House , according to ABC/Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
If they set up their erudition , Republican voters hold Trump for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , according to a CNN/ORC poll last week , four out of 10 say that Trump is the best bet .
This is a change since the time when four out of 10 at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP-voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
At this time in the last cycle , four out of 10 Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against just 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
Still , it is apparent that a variety of GOP-led voters see Trumps 's campaign as plausible .
Even if Republicans gathered around another candidate , Trump still beats almost anyone .
Some experts point out that the fractured field is likely to contribute to Trumps ' leadership , while anti-gun support is difficile to more than a dozen other candidates .
But a poll by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump is reaping majority support .
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina 's 13 points , ahead of Marco Rubio 's 14 points , before Walker scored 15 points , before Jeb Bush scored 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points .
It 's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race .
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds .
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have their voices fixed .
Of course , a lot can be done to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
Forty-six percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
Still , Trumps is strongest competition at the moment of the other outsider , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico `` rapist '' in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was pivotal in public discourse to 2016 .
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump 's crucial Hispanic-Americans will be kept away by the Republican Party and will damage the reorient efforts .
But according to the new ABC/Post poll Monday , six out of 10 Republicans say they are consistent with Trump on immigration issues .
So long as immigration remains in the limelight , Donald Trump seems to be doing it , too .
Frustration over the government clings to new highs .
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson , meanwhile , around half the support of Republican voters , mainly through their outsider status .
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll by ABC/Post that they 'd rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience .
And they 're also angry at Washington .
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa-Republians are frustrated by Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent `` dissatisfied '' and 21 percent `` hellish angry . ''

Jeremy Corbyns debut at Prime Minister 's Question Time
Since his election , Mr Corbyns 's debut at Prime Minister 's Question Time is eagerly awaited
The new Labour leader , Jeremy Corbyn , is expected to make his debut at Prime Minister 's Question Time and to equip himself with David Cameron for the first time .
MR Corbyn will stand up to put the first of its six straight questions shortly after noon , with his performance from the media likely and the Labour MP from close to scrutiny .
He called for `` less theater and more facts '' at this weekly event .
He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns 's leadership , since it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , the Labour leader 's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the fall of the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Torah MPs and is at the heart of several front page stories in the newspapers .
MR Corbyns decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had `` been in respectful silence '' and he acknowledged the `` heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air raid around England . ''
But a member of Mr Corbyns 's shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two Newsnout programme that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem `` regardless '' of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns 's top team , citing differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
The BBC 's Political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also `` stack up '' within Labour , following Mr Corbyns 's comments on the position on the European Union and the limit on profits .
MR Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was making changes to remove the whole idea of a limit overall .
Hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow labor and pensions minister , said that the party was `` very clear '' that it was only against government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000 .
MR Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron since he is Tory-leader in the last decade over the dispatch-box in parliament .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says he has `` crowd-sourced '' ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister 's Question Time is too confrontational , and that he will refrain from doing both `` batting '' and the striker with opposition , and has instead moved on to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
MR Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Business Secretary , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor , and that he addressed John Bercow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a `` fake theatre , '' which is often linked to the Prime Minister 's Question Time , but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so .
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the ruling by a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms .

DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundesliga set a clear sign at the weekend .
Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and secures its help in dealing with the problems that lie ahead .
`` I consider this to be the biggest challenge facing our country since reunification . ''
`` There 's no one can say in principle that this does n't matter to me , I do n't have anything to do with it . ''
`` This has to be of interest to everyone , to get to grips with this issue , '' DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach said .
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he is keen to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
`` I am in the chancellor next Wednesday and meet the secretary of state , Ms. Özoğuz and the Chancellor . ''
`` Because the issue will certainly play a central role , '' he announced .
Football can and wants to help .
The crucial course , however , must be the policy .
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative `` 1 : 0 for a Welcome '' by four years .
`` Over the Egidius-Braim Foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , '' said Mr Niersbach on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta .
Some federal officials also support this program .
As early as this weekend , the 36 professional clubs will send out a clear signal if they are going to wear the pressure `` We will help .
`` We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , '' said Rangers sports director Rudi Völler of the `` Bild '' newspaper ( Tuesday ) , calling the project `` self-evident . ''
`` The refugee drama goes to everyone , no one is allowed to look away . ''
`` We football leagues can , no , we have to use our blast , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , '' said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz .
Hoffenheim 's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a `` prominent sign of the league . ''
For the EM qualifier against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale .
Niersbach described the support of refugees as `` a great community of German football . ''
That all 36 licensed clubs would have started their own projects in their places is great .
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
The message `` 1 : 0 for a Welcome '' we spent is lived in football .
`` It 's of enormous importance , '' he said .
In this year and next year , the association , together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government , will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees .
`` The clubs have already retrieved the whole sum for 2015 , '' Niersbach reported .

Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö .
Di Maria meets on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to advance to Malmö .
Here 's the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday .
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as PSG player , who launched the French champions , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute .
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions as they seek not only qualifying for the knock-out passes , but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns .
But , while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blancs 's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate , and he was replaced later in the game against his home city team and against the club with whom he began his illustrious career as early as 1999 .
`` It 's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League , so it 's a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things we need to be perfecting over the course of the season , '' Blanc said .
`` This is a good omen .
We wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did n't score one or two more goals . ''
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the PD team that could hold a 2-2 draw at their own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend , but he was ousted by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
The Argentine wingman has been described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month , and he hinted at why , when he ran into Marco Verrattis 's pass behind the team 's defence , before he finished off to Johan Wiland , he finished off nicely in the long corner of the net .
However , if anyone believed that PSG would get a big win , that was disappointing .
Malmö , who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach that stage , joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and , with a five-man defence and two deep in the midfield , pitched a difficult opponent .
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , who passed wide to Kevin Trapps posts in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PSG himself admitted himself sometimes , with some mishaps and poor downpours , not least from Ibrahimovic , who was patched at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani used him after the restart .
Still , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic , whom Di Maria turned into a shooting shot , which was steered by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post
The second goal finally fell just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani , with the Uruguayan scoring his sixth season opener after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank from Maxwell .
That ended all the thought that Malmö could come back into the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wiland , from a short distance , to stop David Luiz , could keep the final result low , before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi escaped a goal at the end .
The coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , later admitted that PSG played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : `` Our last Champions League game was in December last year .
Since then , we 've only played in the Swedish league , which does n't have the same level .
The qualifiers are not enough . ''
Hats off to Paris !
It was a great game of them !

Death guard at Delta State University left apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shouted and killed his colleague later in the day , Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was `` sorry '' in the first murder and wanted `` he could make it undone , '' authorities announced on Tuesday .
Police in Gautier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the helpline at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
And said he fired on someone and someone killed .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency room that police had to send police to his home .
He said , `` I shot my wife last night '' and he also mentioned that a `` sweet dog '' was in the house but that `` no one will disturb '' but is likely to be excited .
Police asked the caller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
As police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Prentiss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said : `` I am so sorry , I wanted , I could undo it .
I loved Amy , and she 's the only woman who ever loved me . ''
After writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a professor of history , before eventually taking his own life on Monday night when police officers surrounded him .
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course there was something in Mr Lambs 's idea . ''
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said Tuesday that there was `` no information , no evidence '' for a `` triangular relationship . ''
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen , who testified that they were married about seven years , as a `` good man . ''
The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends .
O'Steen said he and Prentiss would have a daughter , who is 19 , and she was `` destroyed on the ground . ''
He said that Prentiss were her daughter `` absolutely best friends . ''
Prentiss worked online from home , according to testimony from Linsday Knowles , identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss .
Knowles said that Prentiss , who owned a dog called Lightning , had met with Lamb for about three years .
`` She always wanted to help other people , '' Knowles said
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time Monday to tell them `` he 's not going to jail . ''
When police arrested him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctorate in the spring of 2015 from Delta State University , as his life portrait indicates on the university 's website .

Konrad in search of 35,000 wintertime Quarters
Konrad has all hands to do with the transfer of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen-Banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
The chaos in the initial reception centre Traiskirchen has already come to grips with Konrad .
`` We do n't have homeless people in Traiskirchen , '' he told his first success .
Also , the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a big whistle , said Konrad and praised the organizational `` feat . ''
The Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a `` crisis-prone situation . ''
In total , Konrad expects a need of 85,000 Quarters in this year 's year .
To meet the number , 35,000 accommodation must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
If there are more refugees , we can do it .
`` But it 's not a barrel without ground , '' Konrad said .
With the state 's chief executives , he has already held talks .
They would have assured him that they would still be able to reach out for the coming refugees .
`` In Upper Austria , it 's going well , '' said Ferry Maier .
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad .
Tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn , to clarify how the Church will help .
Great expectations also put the asylum coordinator into the ORF action `` Helfen like us . ''
On the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
In addition , you are hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter .
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards for accommodation as `` very high . ''
In emergency times , it might not be possible for travel agents to have to comply with a certain amount of the towel or the size of the upper body .
For a temporary period , `` emergency standards '' would have to apply .
The fact that , unlike the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad is based on his experience .
I am an older gentleman who is not in the face of the falsehood .
Persuasion is his main weapon .
Konrad and Maier do not cause any costs to the Republic , as they declared themselves .
Their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
So far , their own quarters have not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office .
But there appear to be problems with approval .
Linz calls for better division
For the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
This is not necessary at the moment , because the people concerned can currently be accommodated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Luger ( SP ) .
For the emergency , however , other sites are to be tested for their suitability .
Critique exercises the city 's leader in the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
Other districts need to make their contribution here , too .

De Boer , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : `` In Holland they do n't show highlights of the Celtics games more and why ? ''
It 's because the Rangers are not there .
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers .

We really need , really , the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
It is so important to come together now .

The ex-boss of Brentford said : `` The January transfer window is very different from the summer window . ''
The players coming in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you 've seen with our own group this season .
The team is really good .
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Eurowings : Lufthansa builds the group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
Half a billion euros a year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save itself with a better organisation .
150 of the world 's roughly 1,000 executives will cost the group restructuring the job .
However , there are new negotiations with the pilots ' union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the low-cost carriers of Eurowings .
The aim of the realignment is an earnings contribution of about €500 million a year from cost and proceeds syncing , the airline said on Wednesday .
Among other things , Lufthansa does not have a board in the future for the passenger business .
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible .
In future , Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings .
With the new position , Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future .
So far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three-quarters of the company 's annual sales of 30 billion euros .
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining agreement with the pilot association Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are expected to resume after the court 's legal strike on Thursday .
That told the union .
The subject of the talks is intended to be the retirement scheme for pilots .
`` In a year with a projected record result , '' the cockpit aims to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible .

In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots , the `` Wings '' savings concept .
It provides that Lufthansa , in the fight against competitors , places routes to the Group 's own low-cost line Eurowings .

Rome now has a Martin-Luther-seat
Almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin-Luther-square in Rome .
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino on Wednesday , a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio Hill was christened the name of the German Reformist .
On the `` Piazza Martin Lutero , '' he is now recognized as the `` German Theologist of the Reformation . ''
The park is located in the heart of the old Rome , right next to the Coliseum .
The name was requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome .
Jens-Martin Kruse , pastor of the Evangelical Ossetian community in Rome , recalled Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the pope over centuries as a minority were often only allowed to live in secret their faith .
The square becomes symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 1483-1546 ) was regarded as a young Augustinian mönch around the turn of the year 1510/11 some months in Rome .
He found the city at the time as an outdated scapegoat .
His negative impressions may have encouraged him , according to historians , in his later battle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the evening 's Church with his theses against the decline .

Experts criticise report from Public Health England over e-cigarettes
Allegations by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , in part with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PHE ) in its report on e-cigarettes .
PHE released the `` principle report '' last month , describing it as a `` comprehensive review of the evidence . ''
But some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the `` extraordinarily windy basis '' on which PHE reasoned its main conclusion .
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims were `` based on stone or sand . ''
Martin McKee , professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . ''
They said the public expects that PHE 's claim that `` the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking '' are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
In fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people convened to develop a model for multiple causal decision-making analysis ( Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA ) to lead their opinions on the damage from different nicotine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health , whose managing director was previously told of British American Tobacco funds ( BAT ) for an independent study .
He also underwrote BAT 's references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was expected to receive after reports previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International , added it .
The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not delivered , but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
At the meeting , PHE 's tobacco management also attended .
The group 's research `` admits tellingly '' that there is a lack of `` hard evidence of the damage to most products on most criteria , '' wrote McKee and Capewell .
However , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report .
McKee and Capewell said that PHE 's claims that `` there has so far been no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers '' were premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and well-being at PHE , said that BMJ 's claims had already been responded before .
He said : `` e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . ''
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction .
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the national health care system £2 billion a year .
By clarifying current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk , but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction .

Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better ?
It 's one thing that all parents learn soon : If your child loves a book , it wo n't last long before you know it almost out of touch .
Unless , of course , you may be David Cameron .
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children 's book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss .
It was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company 's super camps , and continues : `` fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it 's a book that I am happy to read out to my children , because there always seems to be a picture or a message that we 've missed so far . ''
All nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the book 's plot , instead reflects a summary of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
`` In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win the girl of his dreams , by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , '' reads : A love interest was Dr. Seuss , whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991 , but was completely unaware of that in 1991 .
As if that was not suspicious enough : The text presented by Cameron reads , in part , as the summary of the Lorax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : `` In the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , is hoping to win the girl of his dreams . ''
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father , Cameron seems unlikely to be so familiar with the action of the book , listening to an unnamed boy , such as the local environment , by the money hawkish , trees fake , Thneed knitting onlookers despite the protests of the namesake Lorax , a hooky , cordoned-off creature , `` which speaks in the name of the trees , '' to be devastated .
Most likely , such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to come from Cameron 's constituency office .
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron 's staff but gave no further immediate comments .

Google launches doubling donor campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GOOGL ) announced a doubling fundraising campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach in announcing the donor call on his blog .
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Masoud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old , was talking about her personal experiences .
`` To our trip there were many dark rail and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , '' she wrote .
I was lucky .
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate for help .
The donations go to four charities providing assistance to refugees and migrants : Doctors Without Borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to google.com/divestment to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

'American Ninja Warrior ' crowned first champion
Professional sports climbers and operating guide Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took the grand prize of $ 1 million with home .
The Competition Show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
During the season finale , two men , Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten , managed to reach the finals .
To the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Britten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior , but Caldiero completed that challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Caldiero spoke with E ! News after the hard-won victory , still under the shock of winning the Great Price of $ 1 million .
`` I mean , it 's amazing to think about it , I 've never earned more than $ 10,000 or been alive , '' said Isaac E ! About his pile of money .

'Sonogenetics ' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves .
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that have high frequencies for human hearing .
The impulses work by switching Motoneuron cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
More on this subject : Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure , called sonogenetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Fade worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did it when surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles .
The bubbles , he found out , amplify the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate the worms .
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the seasoning cells .
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , according to a report by Nature Communications .
To create ultrasound controlled nematodes , Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4-ion channels .
If he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are amplified by the microblows and transferred to the worms where they turn the modified Motoneurons .
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons with pulses of light on and off .
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
In contrast to light , which must be sent down to an optical fibre to the desired location in the brain , low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue freely and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull .
`` We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , '' Chalasani said .
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

Man after fired police chase persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he overtook the man off the Canning River .
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang up the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and marshy waters , just yards away from a police officer who tried to `` gently persuade him to return to the shore . ''
Police at Canning Vale were called to a domestic violence gang incident in Beckenham on Tuesday .
When they discovered the suspect , this one tried to escape them towards Canning River .
But he did n't get too far .
`` He stood in the water and said 'I do n't get out , come and get me , ' '' said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine .
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was n't too keen to make his uniform wet , so he used a more reliable tactic - `` A good policeman is negotiating . ''
`` Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , '' said Senior Sergeant Castledine .
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example .
In 2006 , Cousins drove his car into the ditch to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River .
His efforts were unsuccessful , but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-biathlon .

Spacecraft 'Cassini ' finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice panzer of Saturn 's Enceladus , a global ocean swung .
This includes researchers from observations of the spacecraft `` Cassini . ''
As a result , the moon appeared easily on its trajectory around the ring planks .
While this thawing movement is only small but too large for a consistently solid celestial body , it is said in a statement released by Cornell University in Ithaca ( US state of New York ) Tuesday .
The researchers present their analyses in the journal `` Icarus . ''
Even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus .
Thus , `` Cassini '' had already discovered ice vulcanes at Saturn 's South Pole in 2006 , spying water vapour and ice particles , and thus feeding the so-called E-Ring of Saturn .
At least at the South Pole , there must be a subterranean sea , the astronomers concluded at the time .
However , the extension of the hidden ocean was not clear .

Mayor drove 'Gestrandete ' across the border
`` We were busy with the cleanup after the bridge on Sunday when , suddenly , 10 people were standing with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , '' according to Wenger 's mayor , Alois Stadler .
Tourists , they wanted by train to Passau .
Because Germany had surprisingly stopped railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , it was for them in Wernstein , '' said Stadler , who immediately offered his help and who chased the chatter along with two other helpers and their cars across the border into the Near Passau .
At the end of the day , we have forgotten our guests , with a snack and a drink .
We just said we bring them with the car to Passau .
`` It was natural for us , '' Stadler said in the OWN conversation .
They were very grateful .
A man did not take it to pass a generous donation - $ 100 for the fire brigade .
`` It was very pleased to us , '' Stadler said .
The stranded train passengers were transferred from an ICE into a regional train towards Passau on Sunday night in Wels , in order to ensure that rail traffic to Germany was stopped , but still trying to cross the border .
However , the regional train was parked outside the border in Wernstein at the Inn .
In Wernstein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .

Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that was still the last week of the view that the Fed will do so , now thinks the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent .
It 's a historic event because it 's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL .
`` For the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero area and launching a process of normalizing interest rates , '' said Angel Ubide , chief of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The US economy is on a relatively good performance , trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate low inflation .
However , the Fed can not ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions .
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good .
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday

The Brexit-Lager ( Brexit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could win on allowance if the economy gets into a slump by 2017
David Cameron 's ill-fated renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy `` Is it Yes or No ? '' Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the Tuc , who are fiercely divided because of Europe on Tuesday .
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages .
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some member states , as deeply entangled in various crises , as the EU is now , and not always of their own fault , Britain 's own agenda with divided concessions and disturbing treaty changes , which they mostly do not want , are fed up .
In Brighton , the Tuc decided at its annual meeting that it did not like them if they were at risk of social protection .
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie 's agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photograph of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
It 's always about me .
My European friend , who wants a Britain that is outside the EU in the interior of the EU tent - `` not alone with France , '' says Berlin - and suggests that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go .
Germany 's cautiously bespectacled Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the excessively long audition like Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France 's François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017 .
He is also a fading force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government , Spain a leftist .
It is hard to imagine that they will pull out a leg to help the selfie-British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland 's exit from being out of the UK - something they do n't want either , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
So perhaps some such ministers are planning even deliberately not helpful remarks , entirely in the SNP-style , during Britain 's referential campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexite process , my friend is suspected .
`` The renegotiation was a default '' and `` Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation . ''
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be on its cost , and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the Pressebarone , as they did during Tony Benn 's inspired referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
They can look weak on Boris Johnson , the ore euro opportunist who has made himself a name as a `` EU Gerade Banks '' Brussels-based correspondent in the early 90-years .
With all his reticence , Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
This included the Medley of tax-raising villains , phone hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-Instates that own most of our major newspapers .
In fact , Tony Blair thought similar about her , but noted that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage , you better spread bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
In fact , Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron 's refereeing dumbbells , because Blair had put the principle on the EU 's unapproved constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door to him .
The press has never told him to do so .
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave me a friendly knock on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he did n't need to waste any time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock 's boycott Murdoch 's strategy of the 80-year-old , a mistake then and today .
It can last , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , whose BBC-Sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyns 's official position on Europe is - I call it a friendly - in development .
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU .
Now , most of the people outside Ukip 's traditional blistering bulletins and the wildest jails of Tory 's petty Englishism can probably say yes to everyone .
It 's what Hilary `` A Benn , but no Bennite '' Benn on the radio and television this week said when the Scouts struggled in him , not to admit that Corbyns 's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 70-years when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hilary 's fight was even more appealing .
But struggling to stay `` under any circumstances '' - Benny 's expression - was not what McDonnell said was still what JC told his comrades and deputies after all the reports at their Clues ' meeting on Monday night .
Whatever the stemmed Bottom-Up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and , above all , in the strudel of social media , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour support in the referendum campaign for granted , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyns 's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy , their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents , for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes .
As with his ambiguities to Nato - Tom Watson is felony confident that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense of their superiors at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can all be pointless ?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and in Syria , even with a cost-cutting of the Tory government in power , where I was reminded of something at the start on Monday , which was called the British Influence Security Forum .

Manege invites to dream
With the new staging `` passion , '' the Circus Probst takes on the traditions of circus art .
The goal is to draw every age group in the spell of fascinating acrobatics , animal dressage and unique entertainment .
Now the Circus Probst in the manege on the brick wall invites you to dream .
`` Our passion is the circus . ''
`` I ca n't imagine living without my circus family , '' says Stephanie Probst , animal teacher and junior director .
`` Passion '' - under this motto is the current manning stage .
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years .
The gift to inspire the family , therefore , is in the blood .
`` It is important for us to bring people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , '' the 27-year-old Juniper says .
`` Manegencocktail with a world flair , '' director Reinhard Probst calls his concept .
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
Distinguished at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm .
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
With the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to be relaxed .
Ease and agility - with these words , they identify .
Her humorous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women 's hearts in the storm .
In addition to numerous salmon salves , the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with sensitivity and homogeneity .
Balancing the wheel on a ball ?
For He Yuan no problem .
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time .
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little else and fascinated with her mobility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
`` The animals belong to our family , '' notes Stephanie 's mother , Brigitte Probst .
Grievances in the attitudes of circus animals are all too often an issue in various animal welfare organisations .
Stephanie Probst also takes a position : `` It is not good for our animals , but we are not doing well . ''
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
The `` four-legged artistes , '' as they are affectionately called , are forgotten after the possibility of any request from the eyes .
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
If the animal does n't feel comfortable , it does n't want to be in the manege either .
So the most important thing is to do well for the animals .
Especially on their zebroid Jumbo , a mixture of a Shetland ponytail and a zebra , the family Probst is proud .
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a walkway and nothing has happened .
`` But then , suddenly , our little Jumbo was there , '' Brigitte Probst told me .
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege , but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst .
So there should be something for every visitor .
`` One thing is certain , '' says Stephanie Probst : `` No matter whether five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with all the heart of it . ''
The Circus Probst invites its performances from 17 to 20 September on a daily basis .
On Sunday , the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5pm the prices are discounted .
It is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .

EU seeks to double mercury limit in predator fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and give consumers a much higher dose of nerve .
The consumer organisation Foodwatch , which has a corresponding working paper from the EU , strongly criticised the plans : `` Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed with full force to pregnant women and infants , '' explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch .
According to Wolfschmidt , the limits of the nerve agent for large fish are to be raised at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish for `` economic reasons '' from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
However , major predators are already so heavily burdened with mercury that about 50 per cent of catches can not be sold on the basis of the existing limit values .
After doubling the limit values , then only 14.5 per cent would be unsettled .
In exchange for this easing , according to Foodwatch , the EU wants to tighten the limits on other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
Foodwatch , however , called this `` trick '' because smaller gravefish , such as carp are mostly so low , that they are already meeting the planned highs today .
The reduction in small numbers is therefore `` a perfidious distraction that helps the economy alone , '' Wolfschmidt explained .
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which spreads heavily over the food chain , especially in predators .
The federal government therefore warns that `` already small quantities can be particularly caused by unborn skulls of the nervous system . ''
The Federal Ministry of the Environment , on its website with regard to current levels , says that a `` health hazard to the general population '' is not to be expected .
Mercury is mainly due to coal burning into the environment .
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal-fired power plants have more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany , according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry .
The concentration of mercury in fish , for example , in the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube , was `` permanently and comprehensively crossed , '' the `` Mirror '' was quoted from the paper in March .
Last year , Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF .

Ecumenical Hospice Relief Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
There is non-stop operation around the Mannheimer Exhibition Centre .
People do their concerns , sometimes fast paces , partially cozy bumbling .
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalons at the venue .
Keep city streets .
Pulsating , prall life at wonderful autumn solstice and mittens four large plates each with the headline `` Bevor I die I want to be . ''
The Ecumenical hospitalization , with this action , drew attention to its 20-year existence and is certainly facing mixed reactions .
`` It 's about life , so we 've gone with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , '' says Josefine Lammer .
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Relief is available to the passers-by as well as to questions and talks , such as the volunteers .
While some prefer a passer-by spontaneously to chalk up , `` read the phrase `` my life , '' `` with the camper going through the United States , '' `` to stop the war '' or `` not suffer for a long time , '' others remain short , read , say phrases like `` so far I 'm not yet '' and then go on .
Time and again , on the sidelines , there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , how to deal with the dying .
Even Peter Hübinger is just on the spot .
`` Just when I make it clear that for me to end up coming to the end of this world , I can live responsibly , '' says the director of the Diakonic Works of Mannheim , which is jointly with the Caritas-based Association of Ecumenical Hospital Assistance .
Therefore , this high-profile action on 20-year-olds is good .
The fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
The subject of death and dying is still littered with taboos , according to the experience of Josefine Lammer , although just the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to people opening up .
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares .
The death and funeral companion is one of the volunteer staff of the first hour .
Confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia .
When the Ecumenical hospitalization was sought by calling volunteers , they immediately reported and had been involved in the creation in 1995 .
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and loved ones in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hospice of St Vincent .
All of them are carefully trained .
Angelika Godefroid can do well with her job and his experiences and experiences .
`` I see the life of another warty , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , '' she says .
The offer of the outpatient Öcumenian hospice service is free of charge and confessional .
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from families and associations enables the training as well as training and supervisions of the dying and funeral attendants .
Every two years we offer training for new employees .
The panels described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
Further personal wishes can also be noted on postcards .

Ios 9 : How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , typing on `` General '' and then selecting `` Software Update . ''
If it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message indicating that the `` software update failed . ''
To avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait for the rush to decline or try to update via iTunes .
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it less likely to do so by streamlining the update , and it will be easier to do that if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete .
It 's worth making sure your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is near a charging device , so the battery is loaded .
If the charge is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may be shut down halfway and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : 'We are creating this '
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
What is going on in Germany ?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : `` I say again and again : We can create this , and we create that . ''
What is going on in Germany gives the following overview .
According to different forecasts between 350000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400000 ( estimate of the Pestel Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
That 's almost twice as much as previously built ( 250,000 homes ) .
As a result , the lack of housing is , above all , affordable rental property : 60 000 to 80 000 social housing starts per year , and this particularly favourable housing will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from the current 518 million to one billion euros .
Far too little is that from the perspective of the Plague Institute : 80 000 social housing should be created annually , and the federal government would have to invest $ 6.4 billion a year .
The scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is estimated that , in the long term , 55 percent of the birds in Germany can be employed .
However , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them in their entry , criticising Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation .
For the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording company , but also for the self-esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt .
In Germany , according to Thränhardt , there has been a political change : From the work ban on refugees to the recognition of work .
While there used to be a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as residency duty , which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
In society , partly because of the shortage of skilled labour , there has been a majority view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
A major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of English .
To date , there has not been a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
Research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts .
The building of networks is therefore , according to Thränhardt , the premier route to work integration .
The Berlin School Board has found that only a few winged parents give their children to the Kitchens , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : `` For the uprooted parents , it 's only once very important to keep the family together , '' says Ilja Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
In order to convince the family of the advantages of Kita , the administration distributes hand papers in different languages .
Should the need for educators rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example , by allowing more specialist schools .
In the countries , students without a German language are prepared in welcome classes on the classroom .
But they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in English as a second language .
There is no shortage of them , says Beate Stafford of the Berlin School Administration .
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle , no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient studies - the only exception to so far has been Berlin , the interior senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) , but has now abandoned his stance .
Study willing refugees could facilitate access to the university .
For refugees with a residence permit or acquiescence do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seeker law when they start studying .
The latter , in principle , do not get a BAföG , as they do not fall within the circle of eligible persons .
Patient refugees have so far had to live four years in Germany to be Bafög-eligible , from 1 January 2016 , this span reduced to 15 months .
This funding gap must also be closed , however , by Steffen Krach , Berlin 's Secretary of State for Science , and Deutsche Studentenwerk .
Students should get BAföG immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and develop the existing state church law into a new statehood relationship .
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association , which takes care of the newcomers in a professional manner .
Rights also include duties .
In this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain control options .
This includes a willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Aiman Mazyek , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
Those who wanted to end such conflicts in Germany `` immediately have their right to be here , in Germany , forfeited , '' he said in Bavarian radio .
He suggested translating the Basic Law to Arabic .
Integration will continue to be an issue for the whole of society in the future .
This will also have to change the majority society , and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing .
Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti-discrimination agency for a mere decade and a general equality law .
But it learns very slowly , as the NSU murder scene showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
Equal opportunities for all : What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long called for , and for international agreements such as the anti-racism convention of Germany , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
In general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees so far , according to medical correspondent Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
`` As for man- power and capacity , we are creating that , '' he told the Daily Mirror .
However , additional money must be channelled into the system .
To avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery urges all residents to hand out health cards equal to the registry .
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states .
And , in the long run , it is highly questionable to eat so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seeker scheme is proposing .
Otherwise , doctors , in particular , create the language barriers .
So far , the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are worse off about their illnesses than other patients .
Not only in clinics , but also in doctors ' practices , interpretation costs would have to be accepted .
However , it would also help many refugees with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances .
And with another diagnostic look .
In the case of refugee children , for example , there are considerably more untreated disabilities , and young people are concerned with HIV .
With some of the other symptoms of the disease , German doctors would be able to learn from their training , according to Montgomery .
`` Parasite beatings or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect , '' and as far as the doctors shortage is concerned , the refugees may even have relief in sight .
The Syrians have a highly developed education system , and many refugees are even doctors .
In order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps take exams again .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill , according to estimates by the Federal Foreign Office ( BPtK ) : Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Particularly vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Munz , president of BPtK .
A recent study by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children is traumatized in Germany .
Anyone who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder suffers from , among other things , so-called flashbacks with breathlessness , dizziness , heart rashes and death fears .
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong dreadfulness and emotional deafness .
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Munz explained .
So far , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy .
While mentally ill asylum seekers can make a request for psychotherapy in the social offices , it usually takes several months .
In addition , in the social authorities , specialist workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
This often leads to miscalculations , says Munz .

Football : BvB without Reus against Krasnodar : Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund , all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League were finally broken .
The national team will also be missing the league leader of the Football League in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday ( 7 p.m./Sky ) .
`` We unfortunately can not resort to him , '' Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday .
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday , the BVB coach left open : `` We expect a return of him to training on Friday . ''
Given the heavy stress of its pros , Tuchel will change its Stammelf not only on the Reus position .
So he announced a switch on the goalkeeper position .
That 's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of master keeper Roman Bürki .
`` He trains at an absolute top level , '' the football teacher praised the world champion .
Whether Weidenfeller is used in the future in all Europa League games , however , Tuchel left open .
With high probability , he will also play the second game .
The foray statement by fellow players Reus that the final entrant for the BVB in the Europa League should be the goal , holding midfielder Julian Weigl for understandable : `` This is Marco not so wrong . ''
`` I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . ''

Pleasant bathing temperatures : The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
Even though peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing tourists to find warm water .
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
Some people do not go into the sea : A maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DWD ) .
In contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : In the East , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
In the Adriatic , it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

Delicate folk from Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago , Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
Next to him stands a flipchart , on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with fillip .
The entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by Stevens talk .
He tells of different places he keeps recording on the map , what his minutest and tender arranged songs .
Where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
Since then , Stevens has turned out to be a wonderfully creative lunatic .
With the 2003 and 3rd album `` Greetings from Michigan : The Great Lake State , '' he cleverly composed songs that blend harmoniously with the American folk of the late sixties , but always be able to drift into the great opulence .
There 's the rumor , `` Michigan '' would be the first part of a twisted series : Each of the 50 US states should be bested in succession .
As early as 2004 and in Rheinnear , `` Seven Swans '' has already appeared and breaks positive expectations .
As a result , Stevens is stepping down here .
Live is enough for him to play guitar and banjo .
A year later , the musician living in New-York is returning to the series .
With `` Illinois '' ( `` Sufjan Stevens Present You To : Come on Feel The Oregoise '' ) appears a nationwide celebrated masterpiece in 2005 .
Brimming with ideas and stylistic finesse .
The album is rising into the American Billboard charts and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media .
After exceedingly productive experiments , Stevens then served on `` The Age of Adz '' ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic computations .
This sixth proper studio album is still widely orchestrated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and Hall .
As long as the smaller clubs have moved away , the stage shows here will be the colourful spectacle of neon-foreheads and large fluorescent Bühnendeko .
Today , Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-man band .
In the dark Hamburg More !
He mainly presents the `` Carrie & Lowell , '' which has been available since March .
Although there are now nearly 2,000 guests stranded in their chairs , the far more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk .
Without giving a word to the audience , the group is playing excellent musicians through the widely enriched album .
From the audience , one hears : The talk is `` opulent '' and you can throw the `` record straight away . ''
First of all , Stevens abdicated modestly , playing acoustically few older songs , and eventually reverted to the applause .

Ishinger : German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich security conference , Wolfgang Ischinger , considers military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
`` I believe the determined reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , '' he said .
He accused the European states of `` collective ways . ''
Four years ago , one was pleased that the Kelch had gone past a military involvement in Germany .
`` Now the conflict is ending up on our doorstep , '' he said in German radio .
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees .

Robot cars : Government wants to lead the way for Germany
Germany , according to the will of the Federal Government , is to be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the auto show IAA of a `` new mobility age . ''
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , Dobrindt said .
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries , who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA .
The Transport Ministry 's strategy paper emphasizes , among other things , the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio .
To test new technology , there is currently a test track on Highway 9 in Bavaria .
In order for the driver to `` not be saddled with any additional liability risks , '' the federal government wants the legal framework `` to review and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . ''
For example , Germany wants to work internationally to raise the maximum speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres .
The Federal Government also wants to apply for a change to the Vienna Convention , which so far provides only for the people as drivers .
In the case of automated driving , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
According to a study presented by the economic ministry , highly automated driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible .
Still , driverless vehicles on public roads are expected to be `` only far after 2020 . ''
The added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site of Germany value the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
`` The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , '' said SPL transport policy chief Sören Bartol .
However , the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the drivers ' personal data must be clearly clarified .
Still , the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans .
A survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA Institute of Forsa Institute on behalf of the Investigating Decra comes to the conclusion that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 per cent do not expect it in 20 years , and 31 per cent do not believe it at all .
In France , 21 percent of those polled with autonomous cars by 2025 , 33 percent in the United States .
Anyway , motorists in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle .
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom , only seven percent would agree to take control throughout the ride on all roads .
On the motorway , that could mean 15 per cent in flowing traffic , in the traffic jam 45 per cent .
Well every fourth would not leave the car to control under any circumstances .

Terraced houses for refugees , single parents , low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses for people who do not have much money .
For example , for refugees - but also as a signal : `` Not only refugees need living room , but also the mother and the low paid . ''
`` I show how you can still build good and well today , '' the 44-year-old says in interview
Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market .
The entrepreneur , Markus Gildner , is believed to know how quickly living space can be created : He is building terraced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gildner , many refugees will push into the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability .
Because people stay to a large part here .
Given the flow of refugees , we also need enough housing in the next few decades .
A completely banal , three-storey terraced house is the solution .
Gildner : A terraced house needs the least place .
It facilitates integration .
That 's different when you 're letting people down in residential blocks .
Each of the six houses currently built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers .
Each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room .
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
What is the cost ?
Gildner : The price of 160 square feet of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
That is manageable .
The construction lasted six months .
That is reasonable .
Have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gildner : I have mastered my project correctly .
It is particularly difficult to find the threat of Damoklessch special construction and the location regulation .
Grinning .
It is still subject to who in a terraced house creates three flats , needs at least three pitches .
Only in the cities there is no room for this .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How did the residents react to their terraced home project ?
Gildner : There were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
Which is definitely not true .
But do you not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : True , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
My project has the message , even ordinary people need housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low paid .
I show how to build cheap and well today .
That is what it is all about .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses .

At its most anticipated meeting in the years , Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it 's time to raise the benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
Looming over them at one end of the decorated , two-story session is a wall image of the United States .
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation 's economic interests ahead of all other things .
The central bank has a two-run order from Congress : Maximizing U.S. employment and prices here stable .
But since the Great Recession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unscripted third mandate : Financial stability .
And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict , and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is startlingly ready to disengage from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
Although most of the economy 's data show that it is growing solid , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious FedEx officials fearful of increasing this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter of a percentage point .
`` Obviously , the job market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they watch , '' said Lindsey M. Piegza , chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co .
`` But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , '' she said .
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do , which is uncertain of the financial market itself .
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week .
Financial markets , however , expect a Fed wait , with a key indicator indicating only a 30 per cent chance of an increase .
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16,599.85 .
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise rates at this time , '' he said .
If she does , `` she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do n't panic . ''
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed on a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Yellen said in spring and early summer that this year , despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the rate would be expected .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the job market this year was solid .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And although inflation was consistently below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , FedEx officials said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
The economy `` can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the job market , '' said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
But financial markets around the world rallied late last month after China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 16 % below its peak in May as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would cut global growth .
The market has recovered somewhat this month , with the Dow now up nearly 10 % below May 's high .
For the FedEx officials , the market turmoil affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates .
`` If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last couple of weeks , they would put the reins in this session , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , senior research fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official .
Now , he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , '' Oliner said .
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed 's main concerns , so it should not be included in its decision-making process .
But , at the end of the day , the Fed has become the world 's monetary authority .
The central bank 's influence has been enormous in recent years .
The mere hint of then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could `` narrow '' its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , FedEx officials can expect that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision-making is `` more art than science , '' said Zachary Karabell , head of global strategy for asset management firm Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA , noted this month that `` the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that with apparently not linked to economic fundamentals . ''
Lacker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advocating an increase in interest rates , cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions `` despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the US , '' Lacker said .
A year later , FedEx officials reversed those cuts .
The Fed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. Poznan , former member of the Committee on Retirement of the Bank of England .
The recent turmoil does not come near that level , he said .
`` She certainly does n't want to get into the situation where she 's afraid of a rate hike because the markets are getting up , '' said Poznan , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should be ahead of time .
