Lenny Henry : my father has never in the arm .
Never said `` I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family Jamaica Cuban immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father died when he was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry rehearsing for a comedy , Rudy 's Rare Records , which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4 .
The Soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap , with lively Melodien .
But Henry had to work through some difficult Kindheitsmomente .
He went to `` many ''therapies , following the death of his mother , and Henry is thought about his relationship with his father .
It was difficult to know him .
We never saw his face , only to hear his voice : 'listen to the noise .
Let your sister in peace and quiet .
Beweg you !
I want to watch cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up , when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things , such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike .
I never had such a conversation with him .
A large part of my life , he was the serious type in the corner of the newspaper .
Recently opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , Henry won it with an insight into how life may have been for him .
It is high time , but they are dark verraucht , deep stygische maze with Flammenstößen and smoke and soot .
My father was simply earlier in the tub and then you could hear him slowly , as he began to sing , because he could wash the foundry .
When I went around there , I realized that he had done so for years , in order to bring the food on the table , and my respect for him has been growing .
However , Henry grew without stuff of love to his parents as a child .
My father never embraced me , he never said `` I love you . ''
Only when it is my mother at the end of their life is bad , we started , `` I love you , I love you , I love you '' .
Through his own daughter Billie , Dawn French , he disappeared as a child he had to share the love .
Could you let 's stop with the `` I love you '' ?
But to listen to hug me !
Dad , I am 22 .
With Dawn French .
Why should n't we be friends ?
It is a great mother .
It is with which he married 25 years was friends with French .
Dawn is a good one .
Why should we not be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henrys own mother was a diabetic .
That contributed to her death .
So when I was very , very overweight and symptoms of diabetes , said my doctor'you must be radically .
So I moved through this thing and has also had to make a drastic diet , in order to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is demanding .
No one is happy to eat carrots .
Henrys Karrierewechsel is perhaps in its elegant , kurzgeschnittenen Bart .
Since he was praised by critics for his masterpiece , he is captured by the theater .
It was followed by The comedy of errors , and then fences of August Wilson .
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life .
He started with only 16 years , when he was working in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on the stage , when he wrote persons and imitation of New Faces about him .
His television career began in the mid-1970s . `` I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for a very long time . ''
He got in the profession .
I had to not only be large in the eyes of the public , but also learn from 1975 to 1985 , as I could be an effective jokes-narrative-machine , while I was a star on television , and it was really difficult .
Lenny in 1975 in New Faces
As the Bühnenrecht managers in the Black and White Minstrel Show '' , had a slight Unterhaltungsprogramm in which people'black anmalten , led his musical comedy Henry there about five years .
My family was very unpleasant .
Somehow , I wish that it would never happen , but I regret that I have done it .
It was a strange , uncomfortable position for me , but I worked on Riesenprojekten and knew how to deal with a large audience .
But this ' years of prize-winning easy pillar of the British television'was also a bizarre parody of black people ' .
With the introduction of characters , which celebrated the British black culture as both a mock , Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s .
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Black lock in the comedy series leader , among other things .
Advertising , documentaries , TV series and movie roles characterized his next decade , but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought : `` What are you doing next , Len , because everything feels like , when you 're only time rum or join a little bit on the spot . ''
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What 's So Great About ... ?
The first consequence was to Shakespeare .
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare .
I had never right in the school learned something about him and held him for a domain of the middle class , whites in tights and a cabbage at the front .
So I had great fear .
All that we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said `` You should try it again .
Please do not bad , if you do not know what you redest .
Put a couple of words in the mouth , and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare .
Henry on led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was excited .
I had the feeling that I was able to do this .
It was almost as if someone had his head finally set up correctly .
`` therefore , it is a serious matter , take it seriously lern your text , a recherchiere bit .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we made it .
And it was a success .
It seemed to be an accident , and this happened .
And soon joined in the comedy of errors .
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it .
There was a time when I thought , 'Oh , you have changed you ' .
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience .
`` A small voice told me '' You must now bridge 10 minutes while the computer repair. `` ''
Instead of Bühnenleiter announced that the idea of opening , as soon as the problem solved .
I was on the scene and something I said'Oh , thank God ' .
I am not responsible for this .
I can leave it to someone else .
`` You play in a play , so stay in your role . ''
Henry the Duchess Theatre in Fences
To learn the text for Fences was demanding .
Panic is very good , that strengthens tendons .
It also sold well , so it is like a large sign of the gods that I say , 'This is your destiny. `` ''
He says that , of course , with a dramatic voice .
So I will say it .
I love it .
I love to be in a rehearsal room .
Henry but still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is crossed by humorous outbreaks , while he repeatedly people imitated .
I have decided to make a stand-up comedy , because I think that this kind of immediate gratification of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
If that is so , it all goes against a wall .
I am sometimes live at the Apollo , if I want it , but overall , I am not as much as before .
I ask him whether he will ever make another stand-up comedy tour .
The fun that I was in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever give up again .
This is the new personification ?
I think so .
I am an actor .
It is fun .
We always tells a story , and it is great .
I love stories .
The people love stories .

Children need roots and wings
44 years , he was in the Schuldienst , 23 and head teachers .
From that time , Manfred Richter knows many hardend Peter domestic and Kollbacher from their time as students .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , always striving , however , to see the pupils of the people .
The Schneekoppe is the best-known mountain of Riesengebirges .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the theme from his home country .
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia , Trutnov today .
With 14 interested he is after four years of secondary school for the teaching profession .
One year later were deprived of the Sudeten Germans .
Within half an hour , the family had to leave their house .
It came after a few months in a camp in Bavaria in 1946 - in freight wagon .
So making it judges into oberfränkische Senkendorf .
The teacher was held in Bamberg .
Manfred judges had to go to Bamberg six times by train , the nearest railway station , ten kilometres per week , there are three kilometres across the whole city to school , and in the evening .
After two months , Manfred judges in a Red Cross home in Bamberg a Schlafgelegenheit : together with up to 15 classmates in a Schlafsaal .
In 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years Lehramtsanwärter the second Staatsexamen .
There is no free Lehrerstelle Oberfranken for him , he had applied to Upper Bavaria and was on 1 November 1954 to the school in Kollbach .
The'Miss-room was his first ' 'in the Schulhaus tied accommodation .
In 1958 he was referring to the neuerbauten Lehrerhaus alongside the school , a three-room-tied accommodation .
This House bought Manfred judges in 1980 , when the school has been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968 .
In the meantime , there was in Kollbach in Schulverband Petershausen-Kollbach three classes and Petershausen five .
From the 1968 / 69 school year they were grouped into Peter Mitte in today 's town hall .
As the Schulverband Indersdorf was founded , was the primary school in the ground .
To avoid in the smaller school a downgrading , changed the former Rector Georg Sigl after Karlsfeld and Manfred judge his successor .
But Petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers of the extended to judge retirement in 1997 , the present building from September 1982 .
Manfred judges praises the building on Gemeindekosten in addition a Werkraum and in the expansion of 1997 Kellerräume , although the following the guidelines for Schulbauten non was convenient , the generosity of the then Mayor Ludwig Götz .
`` Mayor Götz was very friendly , '' recalled are grateful to judges .
In his entire career , Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative , who had responded to a unit of a school Council on Law and Justice : `` We must never forget the love . '' Manfred Richter began with what he had heard a young teacher .
`` You must consider the two children : Roots and wings , '' says the now 84-year-old .
And he had to `` do not always know : whether it only his pupils or as its own six children , is not very clear .
In any case , judge what was sometimes unconventional .
If students are prügelten , they got it not a Strafarbeit and individual to Nachsitzen .
At the expense of the community , judges had two pairs Boxhandschuhe upgrade and left the two sides compete , even if it should be a violet .
For the sake of the school used judges as rector a good relationship for then-Mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
This led to the non-party judge after his retirement , to stand as the last of the CSU list for the local council , at least in 1996 .
But judges was selected at number six and joined the CSU .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you like to make photographs or videos under water , there is a choice of equipment .
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam , such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver edition , both of which are to be had for about $ 300 .
I have these photos at a family party with several cameras , all of which are available at a price of under $ 350 .
Regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
Check your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are densely closed .
Set your camera on the photos or videos that you want to capture .
Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording sessions with which the exposure time is optimized for the dämmrigen underwater conditions .
And before you jump , you will see to what extent your equipment is operational .
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others by 50 or 60 feet .
Are you looking for in our Einkaufsführer and assessments for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models .
Take multiple shots , because many will not be achieved .
Point-and-shoot cameras usually do not have a flat , with which you can compose images , action-cams .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right attitude is a matter of chance .
So make many recordings .
If your camera has a terraced mode , in which a number of shots are made with slightly different exposure settings , use it .
Stay close to the surface .
The light will be dramatically worse , the further you remove themselves from the surface .
If possible you should stay so close to the surface , if you recordings in a pool , a lake or sea .
You can also bring more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less you will see color .
Go close to the objects .
This is also a good Council under water , but it is all the more important because of the bad there .
It is particularly important , if you are working with a Action-Cam : this equipment often have a fixed Weitwinkellinse , which means that you are close to your objects , if they have to fill in the whole Bildrahmen .

Buying online
Some new books online costs only a third of the price for which they have in the campus-bookshop .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus '' VNO Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be purchased at the specialized Chegg.com textbook retailer for 239,99 $ .
Buy used
If one of the notes of other or normal Gebrauchsspuren nothing , secondhand books are a good option .

Little Casaday , 25 , Abschlussstudent of Brigham Young University , says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used edition of'Strategic Media Decisions : understanding , The Business End Of The Advertising Business `` .
The book has been sold for $ 48 .
Academics as Ingrid Bracey , head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students , whether the previous expenditure are acceptable to ask their professors .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work .
In such cases , elderly spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition .
No Chegg and Amazon is also Half.com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative for secondhand books .
Rents
If you are reasonably good and they give you the books after the conclusion of the exchange rate will not want to remember the rents of textbooks is worth .
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book purchases .
A student could rent for about 20 dollars for the duration of six months ' Calculus ' , for example .
Learn more about the terms of the transaction in which you rent , including on the criminal charges , the case for the writing of notes , underscores or use traces .
Tenants beware : If you do n't return the book , the criminal charges may even exceed the price of a new book .
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option .
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by an electronic license will be provided by large retailers such as Amazon.com , Chegg , Barnes & Noble Inc. for a certain period of time .
Chegg can rent `` Calculus '' for six months for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals , as many classics today can be downloaded for free , while scientific and engineering science textbooks can be very expensive .
In any case , around .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon visit the PEPPER dine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for the provision of prices for books , because you can be sure to find the right textbook .
And in an online order remains to be seen , so Gault , whether the book is actually stock .
This lesson he learned the hard way .
He bought a book that four weeks Lieferzeit and had paid the full price of the College-bookshop .

Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenagers at the beginning of this month , was killed by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo .
The participants were their hands in the air , and not , as they were before the funeral , shoot , 'hands .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown said the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in online discussions of white feminists .
After their experience set white feminist commentators to raise before the race , when it comes to Reproduktionsrecht and salary inequality sex .
While the tensions in the Near West , rose and throughout the country attention received Perez , saw that the answers from white women to 100 % of the race : .
Compared with the responses of black women came shortly after the shots from 9 August the personal essays with titles like `` thoughts to Ferguson of a white woman '' and `` feminism is not only about the oppression of women '' relatively late .
But for Perez meant that an important change .
I do not believe that the feminism , many people take place , which will be on the white and privileges in high-grade type , `` she said .
The people have to say something to the events .
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and ethnicized because the situation in Ferguson is that they need to express it .
For Englischprofessorin Koritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University , Ferguson problems to light those black Amerikanerinnen face every day , are regarded as ' women'in the cultural area but not .
`` I can publish something lustiges on Facebook on me and my partner and get 150 Likes from anywhere , ''said Mitchell .
If I post something on how black people are under siege in their own country , the silence is deafening .
`` How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in the public space ? '' She asked .
Studied in the history of the United States for black women as Mitchell , the race , gender and sexuality , there are no dichotomy between races and Geschlechterproblemen .
For you have black women had the luxury to separate clean the issues ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women , the issues of race and gender in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen , says Angela Hattery , professor for women and'subdivision of the George Mason University that their predecessors did the opposite .
`` from 1865 and in 1890 , at least 10 000 black men were lynched and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman , ''said Hattery .
White women had to be involved in the story , in order to justify the Lynch murder .
For Hattery came the divide between white and black women at the point at which white fighters for women 's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and said that the fight for the right to vote only for one group could be successful : Women or blacks .
You took the decision to stand up for the right of women to vote and the right to vote for Black should come later , `` said Hattery .
If we look at such things , why is a coloured women white women dare not aware of power .
We have not done our job well .
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
After 1920 women the right to vote , it took a decade until white women against the lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organised .
The group was founded nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says Mitchell .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time , in which white feminists `` trapping '' played with the problems facing black women is set apart for generations .
Would it , if the activists , such traditional feminist platforms have the right to education of a child as seriously as they do with the right to not great Empfängniskontrolle ? `` asked Mitchell .
The second-generation feminists , who built her career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives , are now trying to understand what that means .
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem was two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and pithy though published an article by Rebecca Carroll , Kolumnistin the Guardian newspaper in which they more protests from white Americans on the issue of racism .
`` I hope that women who have a separate but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race , which are very different in public opinion polls - will lead the changes , '' Steinem wrote .
Although Steinem in a rather intersektionalen feminism is referred to as Geschlechterthemen as well - in the races , some surprises for Rassenthema in America of their comments .
Christina Sommers , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who Stole feminism ? '' Said to She The People that young men in the United States , especially young coloured men , `` are far more vulnerable than their sisters , '' but Steinems to Ferguson 's comments are in contrast to its previous criticism .
There are hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But as the White House recently , a small programme , My Brother 's auflegte , thereby helping young black men and hispanischen vulnerable , there was irritating reactions of many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
The relationship between the police to the black Community is not the only issue that is at the forefront of the Mainstreamfeminismus .
After the US border police has taken nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country 's southwest border this year , is also the subject of immigration reform to the surface again - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , co-chairman of We Belong Together , an organization that women mobilised for immigration reform , said that for a reconsideration of the issue as a fundamental issue of women , they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women .
These speak for themselves , `` said Mercado .
If the vast majority of work visas is going to male immigrants , the women who accompany them , are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories will find an echo in the women 's organisations , '' she said .

'although a little growth is better than no growth , are the deterrent effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties become for manufacturers , `` said Rob Dobson , chief economist of Markit .

France remains a problem child , as well as the decline of Italy of a robust expansion to stagnation .
Indications that incentives in Schlüsselindustriemechanismus Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands , not more , are also not reassuring , `` said Mr Dobson .

This increased uncertainty in particular , and the confidence of the consumers , the economy is very clear , and I suspect that some contracts are delayed or cancelled , particularly large .

An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves in children 's films could be the reason .
Collin 2014 is referred to as ' the worst year for children 's films ' 'and ' 'Drachenzähmen made easy 2 ' as a purely'functional ' Fantasy-continuation .
In films for a slightly older audience , it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July of entertainment Weekly compared to the average CinemaScore and Metacritic-assessment for each Sommerfilmstart , between the American Memorial Day and the 20 July 2013 , and to at least 2000 Leinwänden during the current year .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the species , whose character things changed , even in a gigantic organisation such as the NHS .
As an advisory anesthetist devoted his career of the task to save the health of both the agony of the disease and the ordeal of treatment .
Among his patients , his wife , was a MI6-staff , with the devastating effects of torture live .
Lawson knew that the doctors , the diagnosis and diseases are important , while the treated mainly deals with something quite different : pain .
One day in 2007 , he was the one , however , the ordeal began .
`` I have not felt , ''he wrote in May of this year .
I had to raise difficulties .
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms , he said that he had made his wife Juliet impatient accusations .
''I want everything at once , rather than later , he quoted .
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week , Lawson felt a very unusual way and concerned without reason .
Anything was in the air .
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest .
Only two weeks ago , he had been for skiing in the French Alps .
The result of the radiological examination before .
He suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer , the Brustfell , i.e . the lungs überziehende skin .
As with most cancers is often difficult to determine the exact cause .
For example , some smokers with lung disease , have been all Lungenkrebserkrankten sooner smokers .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber material , once regarded as the `` miracle material '' but has now been recognized as fatal .
For most of us mesothelioma is a disease which can be as easy to ignore .
Asbestos is a product of the past .
The most dangerous to use was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s , when the industry voluntarily committed to use them any more .
Also , where he was working only people in certain sectors directly with the substance , builders , plumbers and carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
As an industrial Gefahrstoff from another time , it seems to be only very worrying .
But this complacency is misplaced .
The United Kingdom , it seems , is experiencing today is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom-epidemic .
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from the disease than in road accidents .
Annual figures of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and likely future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are seeing the deadly impact now , although asbestos is illegal for years ( 1999 ) were banned all types of asbestos , is that a mesothelioma developed only after decades .
And the scourge of mesothelioma is limited to a former workers of the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and is , often , still present in the houses , in which we live , the offices in which we work , schools , in which we learn and the shops where we shop .
And therefore knows no class barriers mesothelioma , financial limits , jobs or age .
The privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are no protection .
The buildings are asbestverseucht .
Also in the hospitals , in which we are healthy , have been identified as Ausgangsherde this deadly Karzinogens .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was also a plumber .
It was difficult for him , in fact , to imagine that he may have come into contact with asbestos .
Then he found out it .
`` it looks as if the tunnels in the Guy 's Hospital , where I spent six years my training was that there was a lot of asbestos . ''he wrote .
Everyone - students , nurses , doctors and guard - use the tunnel .
One wonders how many of my counterparts are suffering from the same illness ?
This question he could answer , at least in part .
`` from the four doctors trained 's Hospital on Guy , and in the last five years to mesothelioma sick '2010 in a letter he wrote , ' I am the last , is still alive '' .
How many of us are still fall ill ?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48 years ago .
When he died on 17 February of this year , he was 55 .
It was an unusually long survival time .
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within eight months after the diagnosis .
The disease is always fatal .
We can therefore only repeat Lawson 's question : `` How many of us are still fall ill ? ''
Britain 's leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when the epidemic of asbestos in Britain is expected to come to a standstill , a total of 90,000 will be a victim of the disease .
At the moment , most of them have no idea that they will die .

A quick look at the files of the courts , in which people often turn for damages , shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread .
In June of this year , Marks & Spencer , for example , have to be exposed to asbestos , Janice Allen negligent way .
They worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street .
Mrs Allan was only 18 years as when they operate in M & S began .
She now has two children in their twenties .
`` in this matter , ''says , 'I had never heard of mesothelioma , I did not really about asbestos .
I never thought that I would affect the time .
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name comes from the word `` Asbestiform ' , a description of the substance Faserstruktur resilient and flexible .
Three of the six were used in the construction industry .
Chrysotile , also known as white asbestos , today it is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings .
It has been used for roof panels , floor plates , pipe insulations , boiler insulation , even for brake pads in cars .
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos , but it is still seen as a `` major health risk '' with the possibility of death by the EU and the WHO .
Dangerous , however , is the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of braunem asbestos , and experts assume that'it is clear , however , there are indirect evidence that this is one of the main reasons for the unique high Mesotheliomraten was ' .

Janice everyone has seen as typical Mesotheliomopfer maybe not , but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is not unusual .
He has presented a study of those affected will be shown that `` a substantial proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment . ''
In his statement , a large proportion of these contacts is based on the `` normal use and aging '' of our buildings .
It looks as if no one expected to be safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which has investigated the Palace of Westminster , shows how people could also be in the heart of the government , have been unwittingly exposed to the substance .
2009 reported that the Goddard Serviceschächte and pipelines contaminated with asbestos behind the Ausschussräumen of Parliament , whose deadly fibres are caused by something as harmless , such as `` strong Luftbewegungen .
Members of Parliament to look after their own interests , often accused , but here it seems , as would have been the opposite .
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace have received a `` clean '' health certificate , it is now clear that £1 billion amount must be paid over several years to renovate Parliament to modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos , and that the Members of Parliament after the general election in 2015 will probably make more in nearby QEII Conference Centre in Westminster than on the green benches .
The Goddard report has also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions . ''
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
All we can do now is wait .
A person who never define precisely the contact with asbestos was is Graham Abbott , a general practitioners .
As Andrew Lawson suspected of the 50-year-old Abbott that he exposed to asbestos in hospitals during his work .
`` I have been working in a hospital , in the Asbestklagen ' , says , ' but I can in my case do not show it .
It is difficult , in which they have worked , to remind you of all places , and the data .
What he is still clearly remembered the day at the beginning of December 2009 , where he got a fever .
He was 45 , and had an operation in late in the evening .
Suddenly I had Schüttelfrost .
It was very suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I did not believe more to create the journey home .
As a doctor , Abbott knew that the pain of Brustfell , the skin around his lungs resulted .
But as Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma .
He went to work a month .
Doctors have Verwunderte Röntgenaufnahmen his chest and put Pleurakathether to flow from the lungs and test laboratory .
His complaints , but without diagnosis .
His health slowly stabilized , and he returned to his job back .
From time to time the symptoms returned back , however , often after physical activity and heavy breathing .
In 2011 , a patient Abbott 's with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But even now , Abbott combined this with his own case .
Finally , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The link in the case was clear .
In September 2011 Abbott 's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray images to a group of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time , one with a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cavity between the Rippen- and the chest fur .
I am an optimist .
More generally , I am simply , `` he says .
To be honest , I had not so much concern to me .
But my wife , Rachel , was worried .
The result of the Biopsie was in the week between Christmas and New Year : 'I said to me that it was `` mesothelioma .
Graham Abbott diagnosis mesothelioma .
Suddenly , Abbott dates with Macmillan-nurses , one of which he recommended to take a lawyer .
Only now realised the extent of the epidemic .
It turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where pipes often isolated with asbestos , `` he says .
The people who are exposed to asbestos in these buildings were affected .
And so is now mesothelioma younger people , who worked in the typical professions .
The most dangerous pipes with Asbestisolierungen in hospitals were under the earth , so patients are exposed to the substance is probably not .
But many employees who changed in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( like Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canteens ate Graham Abbott ( as it often did ) , most likely came in contact with the toxic substances .
It shows that on several decades after the war hospitals for patients may save lives , but life-threatening for the sending of doctors .
It is still a long way off .
Students presented their bunsenburner on asbestos mats .
And it is not just hospitals .
Asbestos has been used in offices , shops , libraries and Stadthallen often because of its wonderful-isolating and flammhemmenden properties .
Even schools .
Indeed , many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
Across the country , in thousands of chemical hours , students have parked their bunsenburner on asbestos mats .
Websites are now often raised the issue of asbestos in schools .
And meanwhile , items in our homes as innocent as floor plates or shingle roofs by default contain asbestos .
`` it is a Industriegift that included in large parts of our property is ' Andrew Morgan , the lawyer , Andrew Lawson represented 's Hospital against Guy in the process .
In any case , was the only contact one of the woman , the demolition of Gartenschuppens invaded in the 1970s .
So , as you remove your Gartenschuppen .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the cure is immense .
`` It takes a while to process it , '' Mr Abbott said .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I discovered that I am not able to focus on what I did .
Two weeks ago I was in practice .
Then I knew that I had to go and look after myself .
Well , I shall have no further Christmas .
With the greatest difficulty was the change in perspective from the position of a doctor to the patients .
As countless patients before he reminds himself , as he overwhelmed by all the information was that he had to come around .
`` It was very difficult to absorb all of this , '' he says .
`` I asked my doctor'as long as I have ? '
And it gave me about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , 'well , I shall have no further Christmas .
The summits ' .
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious , because our Lebenserhaltungsmechanismus - the breathing itself - is that the fatal cancer .
Most cases are caused by Asbestkontakt mesothelioma .
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres .
If the asbestos is being raised and the fibers are inhaled , they can establish themselves in the chest fur , the skin around the lungs , .
Irritate the Brustfell asbestos fibres and can trigger Zellmutationen .
The problem is with the nadelförmigen actually inhaled asbestos fibres , as Professor Tom Treasure , a heart-Thorax-doctor , 2001 the Guy 's Hospital changed .
The hospital , which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed to asbestos , is now ironically , a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and dealt with a number of other exposed to asbestos in the hospital which also probably during their training .
As soon as the Asbestnadeln the Lungengewebe Treasure , says , 'they are pushed to the margins of the Atemvorgang , where the skin .
Naturally it is invasive from the outset .
The usual options work for other cancers in mesothelioma not so good .
The effectiveness of the operation , for example , is highly controversial .
Some say that it was worth a try .
Treasure denies this .
`` The breast skin can not be cut out , '' he says .
They come with the knife not beat about the bush .
Meanwhile , the cancer `` on chemotherapy is not very good , '' the `` effect , '' but not healed .
Sometimes there are Langzeitüberlebende `` , ''says Treasure .
But in the end they die .
Fortunately , there are some really long , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould , 20 years after the diagnosis .
Mr Abbott still fighting two and a half years after his diagnosis .
After he had contacted mesothelioma , Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson , four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man-of support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene .
`` hello , Krebszentrale ' , he happily on telephone calls .
`` He was very positive , '' Abbott says .
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active .
Originally Abbott , the last four months and extend only a month of life would be likely to have been offered six Chemotherapiezyklen .
`` I was desperate , '' he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson managed `` . to appear in a slightly more positive light the things .
Following the advice of several doctors Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski , cardio-thoracic specialist at Guy 's .
`` we had a benefit I telephoned and got a date , that I would be referred to'are Graham .
A normal patient would transfer must be and must wait for the approval of the treatment .
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers , to be able to play the best available therapies .
But if these treatments , inevitably fail , many patients are from a different financial concern about the future of the families they left behind .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson kontaktierte Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It is known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health since 1898 , '' Morgan says .
But what the 1960ern modified is that we realised that a very low cost a health risk .
And here the negligence of the company began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's Hospital , in their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full compensation '' that Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy 's .
According to the study of his death , a spokesman for the Guy 's , however , that'the asbestos fibres in the 1990s in the affected Kellerbereich . ``
It was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How asbestos can be removed
In fact , it is a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers who care about compensation , to trace the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers are sold or closed .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those who defend itself against claims to know that it is time for them , but certainly not with the prosecutor .
In response to this in this year there were significant new legislation for mesothelioma-affected easier , even if they are no longer find former employer , to demand compensation .
The law has established a fund of £350 million for all funded by the insurance industry , which were diagnosed after July 2012 , can prove a contact , but can not sue anyone .
In these cases , the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process could have granted them - about £120,000 .
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year .
Mr Morgan is like so many mesothelioma-350 million people , for a very good piece of work'of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal of insurers for insurers , '' he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone away and mesothelioma sufferers find the company and they could sue normally .
Mike Penning , then work and pensions minister , admitted that the law is `` not perfect . ''
But both Penning as Morgan admitted that , in the face of seven deaths every day a swift action is necessary .
`` the people are suffering so much and are now in need of aid , ''said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma-law in December of last year .
At that time was Graham Abbott since 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski .
After their first debate , Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom treasure .
This has been accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy , Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years .
Abbott felt strengthened .
`` This is , of course , with the most important thing , '' Abbott says .
This can be seen in patients again and again .
There is something you can continue .
If you place you are worse very quickly .
Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012 .
At the end of August , he was behind the last of six cycles of chemotherapy .
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There have been several cancer spots in my chest .
I was just 50 .
This is not life-threatening .
This is lebensbeendend .
Again subsequently went six Chemotherapiezyklen Abbott .
No trace of the tumours is now more visible .
But the process is physically and psychologically very demanding .
They need that money - think of practical things , for example , or my wife , show how the Boilerzeiteinstellung works if I am .
If you get bad news , you will be negative .
They have to look to the future .
As the father of Ellie , 14 , 16 , and Tamsin , this is not always easy .
`` It is difficult for parents , '' he says .
It is hard to know what to say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I said to my girls , a disease that I have , I will not grow old .
They reacted quite differently .
Tamsin is very gesellig and ungestüm .
They told their friends and we got very soon many telephone calls .
Ellie was restrained .
You have not said a great deal .
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are redolent of hope , not a trace of hope of survival .
The disease is ( as , ultimately , also for Stephen Jay Gould ) a grim security .
As Mr Morgan says , 'mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

His hardcore team of lawyers , in which the case for judges , reject the indictment and argued that the law , in the history of the State of Texas against the longest-serving Governor , diffuse unverfassungsgemäß .
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million in state money to the state 's Public Integrity Unit , which is based in Travis County and determined in cases of corruption in Texas , as clay mountain refused to resign .
This veto caused a public complaint from a linksstehenden Watchdog group .

Under this view , there is peace and quiet
We have a huge strain on Rhöner luck my piece `` in our Rätselaufgabe the Sommerserie last Friday .
There are still a number of these giant trees in the county , the copy is the `` Geißruheiche '' above under white aroma .

Vital is the natural monument , it stands on the other trees in the area and remembers with a circumference of about eight metres of an American mammoth tree .
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
Despite intensive research , there were only references to the Namensherkunft .
Dr Wolfgang Schneider has separate the Bischofsheimer archive in order to know about consulted and older people from Unterweißenbrunn what Bewandtnis it with the Geißruheiche .
The result of his research was the very sober explanation for the name .
According to about 80 years ago have driven the goat shepherd of their animals under white hours on the meadows laboriously cleared and released by stones .
At the foot of the tree , the animal keeper exhausted by the rise should have rested .
The area has now won back its importance , because in the meadows in Ziegenherden wallowing in again .
The area has been declared to the Biosphärenreservats Kernzone also has discovered , Schneider .
When entering the stone collections should be cautious , however , because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular haunt for otters .

With Rona fair Head , perhaps the BBC has found a great director , which it needs .
It is with a proud fame than from the banking world , the media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party .
And it has its own Fronterfahrung .
Her career began in the global Managementberatungsunternehmen bain and so on , as they Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and the media of Pearsons changed .
It was board chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and came back as the top post of the parent company went pear 's to a younger male colleagues .
Their compensation was supposedly nearly 1 million .
Their political ranking is sound .
David Cameron has been recommended by Lord Browne , the former chairman of BP , as it searched for more private knowledge in Whitehall : She was a consultant to the cabinet .
Her husband is a former Tory councillor .
In May , I described the role of chairman with a poisoned chalice .
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The trust works in two directions : Inside on the first guard of the BBC 's own management hierarchy , but also to the outside world as the voice of public concern and anxiety , if things go wrong .
This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly , which calls for a complete comprehensive reform .
But the new incoming president would be to risk to take on everything and the complex is like a Chinese dynasty , auseinanderzunehmen an institution in itself , it is perhaps his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as if that were not enough , even many are keen to see the BBC reduced - overtaken power , money and status .
While the competition is approaching old and new technologies threaten comfortable collateral is the upcoming trial of royalties for the BBC with special risks .
For the modest sum of 145,50 GBP per year is buying the British public in the probably biggest media companies in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : She says that they reached 96 percent of all households , and each of them costs only 40 pence per day .
And apparently , the BBC on the popularity scale back up : 53 percent support it today , compared to 31 percent 10 years ago .
The sight and Nutzungsgewohnheiten for the BBC have changed : I get Nachrichtenschlagzeilen today on my mobile phone and see missed programmes later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very considerable and beloved institution .
It needs a considerable chairman - I hope it has found it .

With the 2 : 0 on Grödig has taken on Sunday a hoping for rapid a bitter week .
`` the victory is ' very liberating said coach Zoran Barisic , whose team achieved on Thursday a Zwischentief in Europe League with the training .
This success was extremely important , confirmed the captain and Steffen Torschütze Hofmann , with green-white to place three vorstieß .
Schrammel Traumtor brings Rapid on winning street Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment with the second season victory against Helsinki and comes with a success in the countries game break .
`` We wanted to show a positive response , '' said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel , with its splendid leadership-volley from Sechzehnereck has asked the course to victory in the 14th minute .

As Schrammel on 13 . Novmember 2010 Bundesligapartie so far taken in one of the last time was in Ried .
The first Meisterschaftstreffer in rapid Dress will remain in special memory .
`` This is something special for me , I am from the Rapid-kids , '' said Schrammel .
Due to the short-term basin-Blessur by Mario Pavelic Schrammel distanced herself from the left to the right-wing Defensivseite and his point was also very good .

Even Barisic was that it would have been better than today'before ' in many games - 'against ' the strongest team played in the stadium during this season .
The first Dreipunkter since 26 July , that despite the setbacks Mannschaftsgefüge intact was : 'my team today has shown that it has shown .

`` We must not forget that , '' warned Barisic , which lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players , `` which were very stable in recent times . ''
The countries break should therefore be used to `` lick wounds and purchase a bit in physical terms , '' said Barisic , which has five U21 squad players in its ranks .
The break is particularly suits , one is Captain Hofmann .
He breaks for the team , goes beyond pain over it .
In this difficult stage , he has shown that he is a very important player for us , `` noted Barisic .
Hofmann gave the Rapids game before his replacement in the 68 minute not only the structure , but also scored the second goal .
For the 33-year-olds , who completed his 350 . Bundesliga game , it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the eigentlich ) .
Hofmann : `` Can not believe that everything now is good , '' `` We have certainly had a bit of luck , but eventually the happiness must come back to us .
Now it was high time , `` said Hofmann .
He urged us , 'We must not always see in black and white , of course , to work : konzentriertem .
We have , as has been pointed out , is not so bad in the last few weeks .
However , we must not now all that is good .
The importance of his role in the team , it could not .
It is a very young team , I support very much at the moment .
To keep in certain stages , but to me , `` said Hofmann .
Grödig-coach would Michael Baur , and his team for little .
He regretted the rapid Gegentreffer'from the category Zaubertor ' , as well as the regular gateway of livestock in the 40-minute , which has been denied by the referee Kollegger was wrongly .
The only criticism I have of the team is that we leave in a few stages were not precise enough .
Because we have had too few qualifications .
Innenverteidiger Maximillian Karner was similar : found'it has started badly , then we have but purely and made a gateway .
By and large , would have been more .

Putin calls for the inclusion of `` statehood talks '' with eastern Ukraine from Kiev
The Russian President Vladimir Putin told Russian media reported on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins with negotiations on the `` statehood '' of the breakaway region .
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow that Putin was not meant to have that under the control of the separatists of the field of wrote a part of Russia , will later on , but that its status for Ukraine should be redefined to give to the representation of the rights and interests of the Russian-speaking region of power .
On 730.624 , 155.291 69.341 , Putin 's call on the Government to Kiewer 25.879 to negotiations on 24.565 47.904 on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents fits 296.494 186.928 , on to the 153 , 128.558 , 15.553 by him on the 62.558 91.506 since the riots on 33.949 , five months seems to be persecuted strategy : aid 81.179 15.719 ) for the separatists 17.268 on the adoption of the 43.888 36.312 , areas and pressure on 106.259 on the Ukrainian Government , Novorossija on 37.968 15.823 , the newly proclaimed region on 55.663 , 76.244 , de facto independence 48.153 for an alliance with Russia on third 29.156 with the West will sector .
In an interview with the state television channel One , Putin the Ukrainian Militärkampagne to recapture the separatist nature areas in the eastern regions Donezk and Lugansk , which was adopted in March and April , after Moscow Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18 March annexed .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently adopted this area as `` Novo Rossija '' or `` New Russia , '' a term that recalls the vorrevolutionäre heyday of the Russian empire .
Putin and Ukrainian politicians pointed out that all those during the campaign for the elections on 26 Oct. while government groups attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope for early peace talks `` trapped in their illusions , '' Itar-TASS reported .
`` We must immediately begin detailed discussions , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people who live there , '' he said .
Peskow said that Putin 's reference to be seen with the greater autonomy in the context of the rule of law must be discussed by the Kiewer leadership for months that the cultural and linguistic rights threatens to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas .
Only the Ukrainian Government is the eastern areas give the necessary autonomy , said Peskow .
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , said Peskow , 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but ' in Ukraine an internal conflict .
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman to correct the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin 's remarks underscored Russia 's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the direct Annektion Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians .
Moscow could have been far more difficult to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine , since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are no Russians and polls arose from the time before a broad majority for the whereabouts of the conflict in Ukraine .
The autonomy that was raised at international forums of Russian diplomats , would the regional governments to negotiate its own trade agreements and external relations , power in Ukraine , and so the Kremlin de facto the Russian territory in the Crimea , the control over an area .
The five months annexed Peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy , as well as an important Handelshafen and historical coastal region .
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines , factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech to the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - for new elections - additions to the Constitution should bear in mind that the respective areas have greater control over their finances and the status of the languages .
But the idea of autonomy is in stark contrast to the arming and incitement to stand accused of Moscow , the Kremlin and the separatist rebel .
Putin 's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing , followed by a further encroachment of the rebels in the past week , after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated through the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea in eastern Ukraine .
The Russian-supported separatists took over the coup , according to Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea , the control of Nowoasowsk .
For this reason , the between Nowoasowsk and access to the narrow peninsula Crimea , Mariupol is to build a Stahlindustriehafen with 500 000 inhabitants , launched a massive civil and military preparations .
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leaders in Brussels and has asked for urgent action to prevent against Ukraine another Russian aggression , a former Soviet republic , the last 23 years of independence .
`` We are just at the point of no return , '' warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit , no concrete actions , the leadership was the proposal further sanctions against Russia , which will enter into force in a unspezifizierten escalation of Ukrainekrise .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk , after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers broke last week in the Donetsk region , in order to support the besieged separatists , said Col. Andriy Lysenko , spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Repo on Saturday in Kiev .
The first is probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Ilowajsk by the Russian invasion , which had been captured in ukrainischem area a week ago , were replaced with 10 Russian paratroopers on Sunday , Lysenko announced on Sunday .

The Höllenjahrzehnt the survivors of Beslan : ten years as the verstrickten children are still suffering , since the dreadful siege of the school .
Ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants in a school in Beslan in southern Russia .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , have been in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world .
We have returned to Beslan , in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the horrific school siege in Beslan in which 334 people were killed , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
As a fanatical Islamic terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004 , the beginning of a new this academic year , were caught and killed , this seemed like the repudiate the evil .
The tragedy brought together West and East in disgust , and then turned surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
Ten years later , we returned to Beslan , in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue it forever .
Their best hope ?
The war of Ukraine now exists - and in which children are dying - as they are now coming to an end .
The girl , which was photographed in the attempt , in the age of school sports hall singer
She was photographed by the Russian Star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous , when she was only in her underwear , was in the age of school sports hall singer , after a mine exploded .
Completely confused Aida sought after her mother Larissa , 40 years old .
Both were thought to be dead , but they survived .
`` A woman told me that I should run for my life , but I could not , '' Aida said at the time .
My legs were blood flow .
I stood up and kletterte again to look after my mother .
It was a soldier in safety .
After a series of operations , it is completely healed , but said yesterday : `` Before three months returned the pain .
I am afraid that I must again be operated on .
Some Granatsplitter are still in my knees .
Their goal is now to be a dentist , in order to help the people , as she was helped by doctors .
This tragedy has changed my life , but it has not been , `` says they pugnacious .
`` This has happened to me , and that can not be changed .
Once a year I always stayed in the gym to remind me of it there .
My friends and I try not to talk about it , on other days .
The pain is too great .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together , as we were small and dreamt of them to go to school .
`` I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and my career start .
In a family I think later .
It says that the siege remain a part of it , even though the memory of each year is rather weak .
I am glad that many people in the world , to our horror and we are grateful for the support of people in Britain and anywhere .
When I see the photo online of me , as I understand our disaster in the school zurückklettere I think that many people see it for the first time , and to ensure that this does not happen again .
The boy , who fled by bullets , in the view that his mother is dead
It was his first day ( Russians go with seven years in the school ) and Tamara survived the three-day siege in his mother 's arms .
As seven years , he said , `` mom told me that I should get me if there was an explosion , and hold her hand . ''
After an explosion he thought that they would die .
She said to him : `` flow '' .
Full of fear , they could be dead , he was on the road and a little bit of sadness baby , took it in the hand and , through a bullets .
His father , Vladimir , into the arms of his son out there , said : `` Damir told me that his mother had died .
He said : `` I could not save them . ''
In fact , Tamara outside stumbled with leg injuries in the hospital , for their part in the assumption that her son died .
After reunification she said : 'I wept with joy .
I could not believe it .
He ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( of the now dissolved newspaper News of the World ) , in order to receive the title of Barnardo 's Children 's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie .
`` This horror is following you every day , but I wish I could stop with the memory , '' he said yesterday .
But I can say that it pale in my memory .
I know that I immediately all my Spielzeugpistolen wegwarf .
But now I can play games with Schussszenen and this is not a problem for me .
`` I am not afraid to go back into the Sporthalle , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I have played in the yard , and have not made it to the outside world .
We never say that they have been killed or are dead .
We say that they are stuck in the gym .
I remember my trip to London , particularly in the toy shop , where I was able to choose everything very well what I wanted , and the ride in an open top car .
But now he has suffered a fear of the ground , such as Ukraine , where wars are the kind of accident that he and his friends .
This horror followed you every day , but I wish I could stop .
`` am so sorry for all those who are suffering under the answer , ''said Damir , last week as a volunteer in a monastery .
I want to help so much .
I will one day go to the police and hope that they will take me to the training academy next year .
His mother Tamara , 48 , said : `` 37 children have been killed in our neighbourhood , can you imagine ?
I remember the appalling silence the siege , there was simply no children , the call and walk , and this silence lasted for many months .
She remembers vividly on their trip to London with Damir .
The people of London cried when I told our story .
I understood at the time , as people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , and show their support .
It was Cherie and its Foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004 .
I wish I could call their own Cherie and simply say that , 10 years have passed , but I remember the meetings I have her and her husband in London are still , and as the Damir and helped me .
I still remember how Damir Borschtsch to eat and all local Russian restaurants experience .
I remember , as he played in a restaurant with Kellnern . Damir fired with its Wasserpistole to them and they ran away and played with him .
And that was just one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British people are so willing to our pain and are supported .
She said : 'I believe that the world has become more in these ten years .
In Ukraine , the war now again , and people die every day , and I believe that many children were killed and still be killed .
These are precisely such children as ours .
I think that , for many of the war , a piece of news is that they hear bored or if it deals with something else .
I know just what these people feel the horror .
Do not stop this and I can feel .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other , and that is so sad .
Damir was large and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or angry at all .
For example , it is not for revenge , he is the last answer overwhelmed .
I know that he does not like to remember , but he has six close friends in the class and sometimes they go into the Sporthalle , candles and light .
When he was smaller , he including - I remember how he sometimes on the SOFA , the face of us away , for hours .
Not schlafend , his eyes were open .
I still remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away . - is now 17 , bigger than I , handsome , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that , for a few hours , I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again .
As I am a following the explosion and the legs came , I saw , and saw the hell around me , with all herumliegenden body parts .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell impossible have survived .
`` I remember that I shouted at him'Damir , lauf , lauf away '' , but I was sure that he had not heard me .
But it has one and it is weggelaufen .
And so it goes on life , unlike many others , for us .

Comfort : The 2004 Beslan-survivor Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege , on a picture of born today
Be blutüberströmtes face was marked by fear , as he Chechen terrorists his Klassenkameraden niederschossen , running his life .
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan .
His mother Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had it before they came to get rid of the University of their older son Vladimir , sold on his first day .
`` I left the farm about two minutes , the terrorists stormed before him , and so was my little boy for three terrible days alone , 'it remembers .
Not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives from us , but all of them have been killed .
I let only managed to survive .
As the date , the more difficult it is to think and talk about it .
There is no single day on which we remind ourselves of this tragedy .
We do not think that it is a long time ago , I think it would be a few scenes from these days I have always done yesterday .
No one will ever forget that , I assure you .
Urgent : The image of born ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as statue ( right ) .
I wanted to remember that born on this day are so happy to go to school , he said that he wants to embrace his teacher .

And now there are even this statue of weinenden let in San Marino .

I understand that , but I also think that people around the world feel our pain , thanks to this image .
Born today says : `` It is important that something like this can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we will ever know the truth .
People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learned the truth .
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine .
We will know what caused it ?
The horror of this world .
I can not understand how it is possible , because if you ask the people , nobody wants a war , so how is this happening ?
Ten years is nothing in such pain .
We need dozens of years to forget a little .
It has attacked my health and I am still .
About three or four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege , but then it was better .
I was later in the year 2004 and was back to school every day .
I thought of my friends and Klassenkameraden who have been killed .
On 114.445 therefore I am always 26.802 in the Sporthalle , has if now on 1 September is approaching .
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends of mine .
It is difficult for me to go to the gym , but I must do it .
I am not as victims , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget bemitleide , but I am not .
My life goes on .
I have concluded the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I shall be Herzchirurg .
My first choice was an education in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health has not .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .

During the siege , he was caught in the gym and sat beside the bomb , which was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorists .
It is actually a miracle that he was not killed .
`` we feel as if it was yesterday , saying , 'let 's go to the FSB as Geheimdienstoffizier wanted , but because of his health damage due to the siege could do it .
It is still with me , there is nothing that I have left behind me .
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with terrible experience - I must say that this is not true .
`` in 2006 , I worked with psychologists and felt that something better , but I can not forget .
And I would like to forget .
In 2005 , a year later , was the first and only time I went back in the gym .
I lost consciousness .
I will never return , and please do not ask me where I sat in this famous picture to show you .
Survivor : let Fanijew today , with a photograph of the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is extraordinary and I carry it with me every day .
My friends know that I do not like to think and talk and they asked me never to the school .
Physically , it is good to me .
I should be very careful with my injured knees , but I can now well under way .
But because of my health , I could not study at the FSB 's intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have submitted my papers , including the medical and they have responded that it was not possible .
My second passion were the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been there two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals ' of cats to cows ' .
He said : `` I knew that I would tell my children never in my experience .
Should children know nothing and it should not , of course , also suffer .
His mother Marina , 42 , said , 'This pain never leaves me .
It is in my soul , worse , if the anniversary approaches .
I will go to the celebrations in his memory .
I know that born will not go .
It must be even more intense for him , because he was there and I do not .
I was at home at him and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me , and all of them are drawn in Beslan .
It remains in us .
Let is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
It is difficult to accept that , if a little so Unfaires experience .
He is a boy , he may sport , but it can not be due to its knees .
He was operated on several occasions , he can run , but no sport .
I would like to see it resolved the horror to 50 % , but that can not be overcome and never completely forgotten .
This terrible experience will follow .
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and the only my pain .
I am I knew well and dear to me , many people have been lost .
My son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that God could make me , but my heart cries for the slain .
I know of families in which new children were born , but also of widows , never married again .
It is difficult to accept that life goes on , even if it does not want .
I would like my heart jumped in me when I saw him in hospital .
And now , I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
What are these people ?
Why do they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country and I can not believe almost .
We were once a friendly country , how can it be that we are now fighting ?
People and children suffer , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine , and many more are being killed .
If we take all these rebels , but , as far as possible .

This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options with discrimination because of the organization of trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and stops set so anti-union forces .
The addition of national Arbeitsrechtsgesetzes , to organise a union representation to create an opportunity for a discrimination abandoned workers in order to complain about justice before a civil court - and to receive compensation or Strafgelder - is a sensible and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not to American standards .
Indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of the bill suggest the link back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks in recent years , the trade unions - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other countries throughout the country , Americans will extend to comply with labour rights and encourage countries all over the world .
There was a time in which millions of Americans , as this country is democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the freedom of association in one breath .
When the United States after the Second World War , Japan had occupied , General Douglas ' Arthur and his staff , which ensure the country to adopt a Constitution that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos replaced by democracy .
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan , they used a language that are explicitly recognized that guarantees workers ' rights of association and collective bargaining and action. ``
When the United States occupy Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pushed the Germans , to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers have to organise themselves , and their voice heard in the new nation , a German added a clause which explicitly aussagte : 'the right to safeguard the employment and economic conditions and to improve to form associations , individuals and guaranteed any trade or profession .
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it are null and void ; measures aimed to are illegal .
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights , designed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as it was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948 , Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form unions to protect its interests or to join them . ''
Since generations the Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
As other countries in this country , as we build civil and democratic societies , told Americans that the right of trade unions to the creation and protection - that this trade union will participate as an equal partner with companies and government agencies in collective bargaining it should .
After these rights in America come under attack , it is actually very wise to lead the American ideal in mind that working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society .
Fifty years ago , as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said :
The story is a great teacher .
We all know that the workers ' movement , the strength of the nation , but not increased .
By raising the living standards of millions of people , work miraculously created a market for the industry and the nation as a whole increased to unimaginable levels of production .
Forget those who attack the work these simple truths , but they kept the story .
The story recalls , and we should do this .
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the extension of the protection of citizens ' rights and protection against discrimination in the creation of employees ' representatives , is long overdue .
Renew Keith Ellison and John Lewis the ideals that America has made in the past , and the promise of democracy einlösten .

Berkeley declared housing to'normal ' .
One of the most prominent builders of London pointed out that the housing ''returned to normal levels in the south-east of England .
Homes in the capital were hotly sought and subject to enormous price increases , and the Bank of England because of the widespread fear of a credit boom that led to set limits on mortgage in June .
Tony Pidgley , founder and CEO of high-class Bauunternehmens Berkeley said on Monday : `` Since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013 , '' and added that this is a `` stable environment '' offer .
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn , because foreign buyers pushed in the capital .
According to information from the Katasteramts are the prices in the city have increased by leaps and bounds to 18.5 % in the last year alone , far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
The average selling prices of Berkeleys private , cheap and student services rose by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April to £423.000 .
However , a stronger pound has made property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible `` villas '' tax before the general election next May .
The London real estate agents Foxtons warned last week that the Hypothekenmarktbericht for April , presented in the tougher Kreditvergaberegelungen , such as the prices lead to lower growth in both the Immobilienverkauf in the second half of this year .
The Bank of England on Monday new data show a decline in the mortgage approval in July , which also indicates that the housing market is cooling .
Hamptions International , a different Immobilienagentur , corrected his prediction for the increase in property prices in London for 2015 down to 3 % , on the basis of an already faltering Hauspreisbewußtseins .
The transaction limit in the most expensive areas of London Mayfair and Kensington and Chelsea , year on year , is now reduced to a quarter , so the broker Wa Ellis .
However , the desire for a home in the capital is a boon to Berkeley , because the sums due to date sales amounting to more than £2.2 billion .
Mr Pidgley added : `` the demand for the right , well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and , as a result , the Terminverkäufe'remained stable .
In June , the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis .
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent to £280 million , sales at 18 per cent to £1.6 billion annually .
In a statement on Monday before the company 's annual meeting , Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year would be expected to comply with the current market expectations .
The analysts estimate in the annual Vorsteuerergebnis to 450 million .
Berkeley-shares were found in the afternoon in the London trade in 23,96 .

A year ago , there was no good climate between the club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen .
Seemed very diverse the positions , as with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction should be tackled .
Now to move between the two camps : it should soon be held talks on a common approach .
Confirm that the club stands Torsten Invest ( Castle ) and Herbert Piffl ( and friends ) on demand of our newspaper .
`` I have called Mr Piffl and that we could get together once again proposed'Sjöberg reported .
In his view , all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future .
So are made visible progress more quickly .
While the castle suddenly friends with the late Richard Dimbath until recently had an eye on a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forests , the `` development and Erlebbarmachung '' for the club to Invest is at the forefront of the terrain .
Herbert Piffl , chairman of the second Burgfreunde , is very pleased about the call for their own data .

Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream .
By a large part of the population , as well as volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist magnet .
Piffl : `` I was skeptical at first .
But over time , I am more and more to the conclusion that it is sensible to press ahead with the project . `` We could create a '' unique selling point `` for the raftsmen city .
Here , there is nothing else .
Moreover , the project by EU subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors would be affordable , believes Piffl .
`` The idea of reconstruction will jettison I personally is not easy . '' He hope that the club at this point might make a difference .
Their goal , first to document the history , `` is important and good . ''

Tax burden of businessmen in Washington , with the economic recovery
The recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year , while the economic recovery accelerated in the past week , and the companies in the Washington area , according to a newly published study were no exception .
Companies in the area of District , Maryland and Virginia paid together 27,6 billion dollars to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 % compared with the revenue from 2012 to the tune of $ 600 billion .
The state and local tax burden of businesses rose last year by 4.3 % to EUR 671 million , compared to 3.9 % in the year before , and it was the third consecutive Wachstumsjahr after several years of declining orders in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes increased more than the local taxes , 4.3 % , so the study carried out by the National Centre for taxation , a Steuerpolitikgruppe from Dienstleistungsagentur Ernst & Young .
More than half of the District , 56 % , revenue comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of Mary 's revenues come from businesses .
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from businesses , with 28 percent .
A large proportion of the increase in revenue is founded the company in a recovery of Immobilienwerte , researchers , leading to an increase in the Immobiliensteuern by 3.7 % this year for the three successive years with a growth rate of less than 1 % .
While a large proportion of these profits for large states like California , New York and Texas , is of course also applies to the area of Washington .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia paid more than $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes together last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase in the course of a year .
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values is not as effective in the increase of state and local tax revenues in Maryland , as in the real estate taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of corporate tax rulings .
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of Immobiliensteuern .
On 509.719 '490.305 , 28.872 in Maryland 419.306 is the following : a large part of the property , 381.955 352.001 , 70.352 , 58.838 , particularly in the field of taxation on 28.261 to DC is either 267.811 , 128.668 , 61.645 , 40.822 on 17.375 in possession of the government or 14.597 of non-profit organisations , the pay on 14.334 57.539 not Immobiliensteuern on 29.285 , `` said on 113.582 , 26.995 , Douglas Lindholm , 81.218 , managers for the 49.154 , Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes , for example , to be able to offer the same services that offer other states .
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market
Unternehmenseinnahmen seem to recover the data .
Companies in the region reported income taxes in Staatsorganisationen of 2.3 billion compared to $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
During the trend in the same direction , the local tax burden for companies in all three areas .
The growth rate was significantly higher in the District corresponded with the national average of 4.3 percent , while the increase in Maryland , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia reported a unterdurchschnittliches tax revenue from 4.1 % .
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes ( in all three with 6 percent in all three areas , there are strong business rates ) .
The corporate tax rate from 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at relatively high 9,975 percent .
A similar study at the beginning of this year , the US Chamber of Commerce showed that lower state and local business taxes will be required in Virginia and a total of a better tax climate than in Maryland .
In the study of the District was not investigated .
Despite the advantages , Virginia has been under pressure from its southern neighbors .
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year .
If the government continues to his Einkommensziele next year , could reduce this law by 2017 up to 3 % of the Unternehmenseinkommenssteuersatz of the state .
In the meantime , there seems to be better off small businesses in Washington , and they are therefore more state and local taxes , as the recent study .
Taxes paid by small businessmen as personal income taxes - a Übergangsstruktur , organised under the most small businesses - in the District , Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 % in the last year to EUR 2.4 billion dollars , a faster rate than the taxation as a whole .
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue in this year , with an increase of general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year .
However , if the spending cuts by the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region , the Washington area could lag behind .

Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter `` J '' .
They zerflossen , one could best describe it , they are slowly on a box that you have in the rain .
Occasionally , a woman told him that he is too serious , exhausting , intense , aloof and perhaps kratzbürstig .
And then schüttelte him .
Kratzbürstig knew it .
He was stachelig , as in between .
The last victim of the sting was just starting the affair had been promising for a reduction of the lonely boredom of his life than usual , and he might even have brought a degree of satisfaction .
Ailinn Solomon 's was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island , which was even more remote and harsh as Port Reuben .
On 415.221 , 190.908 81.011 you was the 60.139 , 56.156 , 35.363 , Kevern on 15.390 for her aunt , has begun to south on 50.500 with an older monitoring on 174.903 and 221.352 the inherited the 74.140 with the relevant behalf , 111.217 24.323 Paradise Valley on a piece of land on 85.977 in a wet paradise 48.847 , but on 207.958 valley ) .
For several years , no one lived in the house .
The pipes are taking in the bathrooms were still Nacktschnecken spiders , can not , had left their mark on all windows and believed that they belong , and the garden was the as huge Kohlköpfe appeared überwachsen with weeds .
It was as the House from a children ’ s story , both alarming as attractive , a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' is on the list for the Man Booker Prize in 2014 .
The Shortlist will be announced in the next week .
Kevern had sat in the high grass on the broken deckchairs händchenhaltend with Ailinn and an unusually hot Frühlingsnachmittag . both had enjoyed the country with relaxing music and soothing news was self-sufficient , as the sight of its brown legs crossed it in an old song of a long forgotten black performer , listened to his father in the House in closed shutters , eingeklinkt like in the Dienstkonsole geistesabwesend .
Your feet are too great .
Due to their own aggressiveness songs of this kind were not played more on the console .
It is not prohibited banned - nothing was so right was not easy .
It was successfully obsolesziert , such as the word obsoleszieren .
The general taste , which managed the money never decrees and rules , and how the people in books the from-Tellerwäscher-to-millionaires-memoirs , Liebesromane Kochbücher and choose the music they so chose the Balladen .
In the euphoria of the day began Kevern big feet to an imaginary piano to play and in a gross-Komische Serenade Ailinns besingen .
Ailinn do not understand this .
This was a well-known song of Jazzpianisten called Fats Waller , 'he said it and automatically presented two fingers on his lips .
That his father had always done , in order to stop the letter J , before he came out of his mouth .
It was when he was still small started as a game between him and his father .
His father had played it with his own father , he says .
If you have a word with a J anfängst to put on your lips two fingers , it will cost you a penny .
It was not a very lustiges game at the time , and it was also not very fun .
He knew that this was expected of him , that was all .
It had to explain what Jazz .
Ailinn had never heard what .
Jazz , even if it was not played directly .
This was no longer of improvisation .
It was only room for a single'if ' in life .
The people wanted to start a verse where they end would be quite safe .
As well as the mind .
Its unpredictability , people nervous .
And Jazz was musical ausgedrückter intelligence .
When he was ten years old , was to have heard of Sammy Davis Junior without Kevern knew something about Jazz of the half-secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least that he had not Ailinn Fats Waller was black and white .
At their age , they probably could not remember a time , in the Popsänger were not black .
That was again no laws or constraints .
A compliant society meant that every element of this society grateful the principle of Gruppenbegabung agreed - grateful , as the fate spared .
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and body for entertainment and sports , so sang and ran them .
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as by nature and were served with the task to ensure that no family remained without functioning telephone service .
What is left of the Polish community , did the drains ; what was left of the Greeks , fact plate .
On 711.824 , 126.041 , those on 115.657 from 11.910 106.382 , the Gulf States and 92.228 the Levant , their grandparents 20.191 71.777 on the country had not quickly rely on 572.797 than about what had happened , 518.151 , 451.681 , 56.161 if ES happen has happened - 362.409 , 81.165 from fear , to be charged on 21.629 for Feuerschürens on 38.643 , 45.414 , 254.861 from fear , then that the flames eat on 34.084 next 49.706 as they were - 88.385 , 62.585 , had opened the 31.791 , Labneh and Shisha-pipes-restaurants on 50.115 , 23.763 , remained in mind and have been on 65.170 30.717 51.243 , with the lack of low .
Each according to his ability .
Because they had heard only ballads , it fell Ailinn difficult to understand how the offensive words , the Kevern 's very front yard had ever could be set to music .
Music was an expression of love .
`` They are not really offensive , '' said Kevern .
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
My father has never insult someone , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security .
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of huge cabbage leaves .
Ailinn still do not understand .
Why would your father should love something ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , but hesitated to put two fingers to their lips again in their presence .
They already thought that he was a little strange .
`` it appeared to him , ''he said .
She shook her head in disbelief and kept Keverns perspective .
There was nothing to see in the world , as her ungekämmtes pitch black hair .
There was nothing that otherwise he would want to see .
`` If you say it , '' they mean no conviction .
But it never explains why you have me vorsingst .
They seemed to be honest .
My feet are too big ?
He saw yet again .
Your feet do so directly .
Perhaps your ankle , a little bit ...
And you say that you hates me because my ankle to fat ?
You hate ?
Of course I hate you .
This is only the stupid song .
He could have said `` I love you , '' but it was still too early .
`` Your thick ankles are precisely the reason why you find me gefällst , '' he tried it instead .
I am a bit perverse .
That sounded not right .
It was meant to be funny .
When he tried to be funny as his father did not reassuring Charm , because he needed to control the jokes inherent cruelty , he is often expressed in difficulties .
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he wanted to be the , Kevern .
In spite of its kind eyes .
Ailinn Solomon 's was red and arose from their deck chair , raised the console and buried the wine they had drunk .
Holunderblütenwein drunkenness , was no excuse for him .
In their excitement , they seemed to tremble , like palm fronds in the storm .
`` your Dickkopf is precisely the reason why I took perverse to you myself , ''said they ...
Except that I am not at all .
They did it , both because of the unnecessary Unfreundlichkeit his words , as well as the fear , in their eyes , as they showed him auflehnte .
They thought that he would beat them ?
She had not told him of his life on the cold northern archipelago , where they grew up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially such as here .
The same huge and icy ocean broke up here and there on the shore .
On 265.142 509.686 on the same bewildered men , 219.699 , 127.370 with 118.763 , 37.738 still dickerer skin and 78.782 , verdrießlicher on 67.131 after the 56.161 , DEM what happened was 13.006 as it 57.759 their ancestors on 25.546 as 18.732 , smugglers and wreckers on 67.601 was gone on 60.620 of pub on 30.661 to pub , 155.872 13.522 always willing to impose on the hand on 50.462 30.235 against a woman on 68.347 , 58.840 , 41.528 on I refused or verlachte .
Dickkopf ?
It would have shown a big fist , if not farewells .
They only Knut Chen - Knut Chen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - they only beat Knut Chen and then .
Keverns believe it was an unnecessary refinement that Knut Chen was an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomon 's gave him a sign to go through her body .
He arose from the deck chair as an old man .
They also felt bleiern , but the impact of his grief surprised them .
That was not the end of the world .
They knew very few .
They saw him as he removed himself - as he watched from a room on the top floor of their companion - a man , complained had provoked by something he himself .
Adam leaves the garden , they thought .
They felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against it .
A man turned on her , succumbed to his back , ashamed , defeated , without fighting spirit - why it was a sight that seemed to know them well , if they could not remember a single time , where they had seen something like this before the day before ?
As it was alone to get back on their feet Ailinn Solomons .

I must also ask : Are you an atheist ?
I believe this must not say , 'I replied ESME Nussbaum .
Are you lesbian ?
Once stood ESME on their right to privacy and refusal of the statement .

Once silence .
`` I ask not , ''said Luther Rabinowitz , finally , 'because I am against Atheismus , Lesbentum or feminism .
This is a vorurteilsfreier workplace .
We serve an unprejudiced society .
But certain types of hyper-sensitivity , which in themselves are absolutely unacceptable and commendable , occasionally can distort results , as you have presented to them .
They have obviously prejudices against the church , and these things that you describe as `` disingenuous '' and `` raw '' could be interpreted as well as an expression of strength and vitality of course by others .
If you happen to the herumreitet IS what happened when ES happened IS , as if it had happened yesterday , means to take its essential vitality to the country .
ESME Nussbaum looked around , while Rabinowitz said .
Behind his head repeated the advice of an LED lettering in Flamingo Rosa Ofnow gave the country in the last quarter-century or more .
Smile on their neighbours , you value your partner , you will hear ballads , please visit musicals , use your phone , you , you , you hear , you agree to excuse yourself .
Talk is better than silence gesungene word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I can absolutely understand what you want , '' ESME Nussbaum said in a quiet voice , as she was sure that her boss had spoken to an end , `` and I say anything other than that we are still not healed as effectively as we fool ourselves .
My concern is that without notice of us , we may find , as we repeat the mistakes that led to disclose what will happen if IT IS done in the first place .
This time , but not the other , in which we miss our anger and mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formte in the hands of a pyramid .
To indicate a patience .
`` They go too far , '' he said , `` if you describe the actions as a '' mistake `` that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
They go too far , when you say that their `` rage ''and `` suspicions '' to `` other ''have been omitted .
It should be to remind anyone in your position , that the understanding of the past , such as the protection of the present , not by'us ' and'other ' are not necessary .
There was no `` and there was no'other ' .
It was a time of disorder , which is what we know .
`` From , if we are honest with ourselves , ''dared not part of society can claim to have acted well , ESME post .
I would accuse anybody .
Whether it was bad or good , what is done is done .
It was at that time .
There is nothing more to be said - because we are in agreement .
And assigned as it must be , if such a settlement would be appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate them , no fault must be repaid .
But what is the past , if we do not learn from it -
The past is designed to ensure that we forget it .
If I may say something -
Luther Rabinowitz , his pyramid coincide .
`` I will remember her report , '' he said and dismissed them .
The next day , when she went to work as usual , it has been overtaken by a motorcyclist , who described as passers-by , was driven into a kind of `` brutal rage '' on the footpath .

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed , as reported information on Monday morning : the online retailers and Videoproduzent , and a number of other things , buy the Videostreamingdienst Twitch for 1.04 billion dollars ( 970 million US $ ) .
The announcement is not surprising , because no one expects a takeover of Twitch , but because it was widely assumed that YouTube buy the company .
Three months ago , it looked as if the sale of Twitch decided to Google 's video service for a cool billion . The cooperation also appeared , of course .
Twitch it was founded as a Justin.tv only three years ago , was a Live-version of YouTube - launched as a general Streamingdienst .
Instead , it was ' a platform for players , who published their Bravourstücke in games , a'YouTube for live games , so an insider .
The Twitch interface .
And `` let 's play , '' a video genre , in the opinion of the ( mostly older ) games give a veneer of secret science theatre , are already very popular on YouTube .
It is precisely that YouTube is often called , if you want to describe Twitch , so was the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy a little bored , a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitors .
A mystery to me why the deal with YouTube did not come about because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as it is Amazon .
Everything that we know at the moment is Emmet Twitch sheer , President of this statement : `` We have decided on Amazon , because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us get there faster . ''
Another mystery is , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
For snobs like me who say that they prefer to watch a sport , it is difficult to understand the attraction , the assumption that others watching the games themselves to take the control console in the hand .
It is one thing to see a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning on the shoulder while they trailed by resident Evil , and quite another to watch a spinner as 20 times in a row in Call of Duty is shot in the head .
All of these games , you could see it now .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego games today , so the watch without control over the look of their own perspective can be a good recipe for headaches .
I admit that the quick passes , all of our electronic age in the Roger Bannisters complete games in record time , are entertaining .
But as long as not a game or Humorvirtuose is Twitch-channel is probably not so very interesting .
But what sceptics as I know it ?
Twitch is called of 55 million of visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internetverkehrsspitzen .
And exactly how to make money from Amazon ?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch so elegantly integrated into Amazon instant Video , such as YouTube Twitch simply could swallow .
But Twitch has something that each company would like : Thousands of young men to be courted as advertisers .
As the chairman of Twitch , shear , said , 'both Twitch Amazon and believe in the future of the Gaming , `` and the medium shows no signs of contraction , not even - Schluck - as a spectator sport .

The population gets to feel the impact of the epidemic directly and urgent : Food are scarce .
On the markets , the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice is waning .
At the same time , the strong international companies dependent region of our image , with far-reaching consequences .
The greatest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time , says Philippe Hugon by French Think Tank Iris .
What matters is how far and how long the virus will spread .
Investors can get the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest , `` warns Hugon .
The disease burden on the budgets of the Member States also strapazierten
The disease is also the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned .
The rating agency Moody 's that their budgets to exhaustion of the deteriorating economy of the high expenditure for the health care system and , in addition , is concerned .

China denies Hong Kong law on government election , protesters swear vengeance
On Sunday , the Chinese parliament against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections despite the increased calls for democratic reform in Hong Kong 's electorate .
This approach is probably the long feeds the protests in Hong Kong Geschäftsbezirk , began in the space of a few hours after the announcement during activists planning and mobilisation .
The decision of the Chinese People 's Congress allows the communist leaders in principle to reject all the candidates are not loyal to Beijing .
This is no surprise , but it makes us angry , `` said Rechtsexpertin Emily Lau , leader of the Democratic Party .
That is not what was promised to Beijing .
They have lied to the residents of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In its defence of the Chinese decision said Li R & D & I , Vizegeneralsekretär of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , the licensing of public nominations ' chaotic'for the Hong Kong Government in the elections .
Since 1997 , when Britain returned control of the Chinese Hong Kong , Beijing has promised to let the people choose the government leaders from 2017 .
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough , because there is a direct suffrage to the citizens of Hong Kong , but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process by a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing firmly in hand .
After a new clause should also be allowed only'candidates with love for the country and love to Hong Kong ' .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests took place in Hong Kong for several years .
The movement is behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong Occupy Central With Love and Peace , whose organizers have threatened to insulate the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage .
On Sunday evening , within a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
For the demonstration of the organisers said that their movement reached a new level of civil disobedience , and they were in the coming weeks , wave of protest .
They gave no details , however , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
In an online communication has told the organizers that the movement `` the occupation of the central district considered only as a last resort , an action that is expected to take place only if all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted , and there is no other choice .
We are sorry to have to say that all Dialogchancen today and the occupation of Zentralbezirks will definitely take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong have prepared on the announcement of Beijing for days , and it was on the Sunday before the government buildings more stringent security measures , including police forces and the barricades .
The unrest that they are losing control of their city , many in Hong Kong by the feeling .
The influx of people from the mainland reinforces the competition for products and services .
There is a growing fear that Hong Kong 's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing .
Some have criticised the demonstrations of Occupy-Central-movement , because they are the affiliated - the lifeline of Hong Kong - compromises .
`` The protests , which they say , could cause major economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , '' said legal expert regime Ip , who criticised the movement for a long time .
We do not want any fears that Hong Kong spirals out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
China 's state-controlled media also reported recently on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
This summer , an unofficial referendum organised activists to voting rights on which 780.000 people took part - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands attended one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region .

While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues , the education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year .
`` I hope that the school is open again soon , so that we can continue to learn , as the children in the world and the Jewish children , '' said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City .

Around the supply stands on the castle garden meadow had made it Salzwedeler , but also guests from the hotel and more comfortable surroundings .
It 's the first live performances , wippten enjoyed with the foot to the beat of cool drinks - in short , relaxation and pleasure were the order of the day .
And the right across the generations .

In a first cautious estimate the Salzwedeler involved in organising of around 1 200 visitors in the Burggarten tummelten .
There have been problems with the sound .
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band blocks ' n 'Rox broke their appearance so unnerved .
The technicians were to be capable of creating a halfway reasonable Sound .
The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents because of a puncture could not be brought to salt fronds .

The premiere of Amula-Open-Air was more of the visitor numbers as successful .
And in bad weather .

It is actually more philosophical testimony as a biography , which put on paper in 287 sides Konstantin Wecker , songwriter , a pacifist , politsicher activist , ex-prisoners , in `` monk and warriors .

And he is brutally honest : From the Onanie as high school student to shoplifting and drug use , he leaves no human weakness .
Also , to demonstrate how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
Broad areas are too abstract , but even more important concepts : Love , soul , ego , Being in Now , spirituality - all that he tried to go to the bottom , in a very philosophical , but also very personal way .
And he explained his pacifism , its social criticism , its political commitment - and , as the music has not only ( the Opernliebhaber became the Soul and Rockmusiker ) , but also those .
The latter has the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker `` by Subtraktion ' , as he says , ' by all unnecessary brake '' , closer to the asketischen monk .
Between all the hochgeistigen views but there are also a short anecdotes on earth : approximately on beatings in a restaurant or a crazy proposal used car , he planned on a tree .

Their demands that the Bezirksverwaltung Harburg currently unused houses on the accommodation available .

Judge temporarily blocks legislation that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close

This measure , which was made by Bobby Jindal , governor of Louisiana , into law in June and come into force on 1st Sept. to were doctors that perform abortions , forced to buy a patients right to a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice .
The judge 's decision means that the doctors can continue to carry out preliminary legal abortions , while they apply for such a right .
`` The plaintiffs will be able to continue to work in accordance with the law , while trying to obtain these rights , '' Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling .
Within a month , a hearing will be scheduled for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law .
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision , the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors gained more time to obtain hospital admissions .
`` Today 's decision means that the women '' in Louisiana some underhand escape law which wants to deprive them of their health and their rights , Nancy Northup , president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights , which sued on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state to stop the law .
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling on the doctors stretched from the two hospitals that had not joined the lawsuit , and also asked for instruction .
Louisiana is one of 11 states have enacted similar laws , but courts have recently such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be declared constitutional .
Key points of a law in Texas , most of the remaining clinics in the state have been forced to close , were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
Abortion supporters and the American College of Ostretricians crushing , as well as the American Medical Association have agreed to say that the rights of doctors demand unnecessary restrictions .
Abortion opponents counter that the measures are designed to protect the health of women , although some also welcomed the impact of a closure of hospitals .
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has Patienteineinweiserechte , the Center for Reproductive Rights said .
If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to perform abortions , this doctor no longer would run out of fear for his safety , the operation , the group said .
In their arguments against the judgment of the Louisiana state officials said that they would not punish doctors for performing abortions , while their requests for patient rights , no way were still pending .

With Rona fair head the BBC has found perhaps the great director she needs .
She meets with a proud fame tow from the banking world , the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party .
And it has its own front line experience .
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co. , where she moved to Morgan Stanley , Bomba , ICI and the world 's media .
She was seven years back , CEO of the Financial Times and came when the top post of the parent company 's went to a younger male colleague .
Your severance allegedly amounted to almost £1 million .
Even their political ranking is solid .
It was David Cameron recommended by Lord Browne , the former chairman of BP , when he was looking for more commercial expertise in Whitehall : It became an adviser to the cabinet .
Her husband , a former Tory councillor .
Back in May , I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned chalice .
Not only the BBC is a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The trust works in two directions : Inside at the first guard of their own management hierarchy at the BBC , but also to the outside as the voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong .
This ensures an almost untenable duopoly , which demands a full comprehensive reform .
But the new incoming president would risk it , to strike at everything and disassemble an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while he expresses themselves perhaps his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as if that were not enough , many are keen to see the BBC reduced - outdated power , money and status .
While the competition approaches and new technologies threaten the old , comfortable certainties , the upcoming negotiation of the royalties for the BBC is connected with special dangers .
For the modest sum of £145,50 per year , the British public certainly buys into the largest media company in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : It says that it reaches 96 percent of all households , and each of them only costs 40 pence a day .
And the BBC seem to rise on the popularity scale upwards again : 53 percent now support it , compared with 31 percent 10 years ago .
The sight and usage habits for the BBC have changed : Now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very beloved and important institution .
It needs a great leader - I hope she has found him .

Students often differ in their expectations and demands from the students in 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with VIF can be just that .
The National Students Union , however , criticised the service as aloof .
Megan Dunn , vice-presidents of the nus for higher education , said : `` This offer seems to be completely separated from the lives of the majority of students .
Many of the students who begin this month with the study , are facing a crisis in the cost of living , because the available funds can be in the form of loans and grants by the soaring bills are the simplest life step before they even think about spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as the arrival at the residence .

His methods were unconventional , sometimes , but always carried by his desire to see the man in the student .
The Sněžka is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the theme from his homeland .
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia , Trutnov .
Even at 14 he became interested after four years of secondary school for the teaching profession .

Within half an hour , the family had to leave their house .

In addition , Manfred Richter had to run six times a week , ten kilometres to the nearest railway station , take the train to Bamberg , there are three kilometres across the whole city to school and back in the evening .
After two months , Manfred Richter was in a Red Cross shelter in Bamberg , a bed , along with up to 15 other students in a dormitory .
In 1951 , he made the first and , after three years of teaching in 1954 , the second state examination choice .
As Upper Franconia for him had no free teacher job he applied to Upper Bavaria and on November 1 , 1954 , came to the school in Kollbach .
The `` Miss-Room '' was his first `` service apartment '' in the school .
In 1958 , he moved to new teachers in the house next to the school , a three-room-service .

Manfred Richter praised the generosity of the then Lord Mayor Ludwig Götz , who in addition to local costs and build a factory space in the basement extension in 1997 , although that according to the guidelines for school buildings was not eligible .
`` Mayor Götz had '' very friendly school , judge gratefully remembered .
In his entire career , Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative , who had responded to a department of education on law and justice : `` One must never forget the love . '' Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher .
`` You have to give to the children of two things : Roots and wings , '' says the now 84-year-old .
And he had to learn : `` That is not always possible . '' Whether he is here only says his students , or just his own six children , not entirely clear .
In any case , Judge Tun was sometimes unconventional .
If they got beat up students , not a punitive operation and were ordered not to sit .
At the expense of local judges had to acquire two pairs of gloves and play the two sides against each other , even though there should be a violets .
For the good of the school judges used as a good relationship with the former mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
This was the side judge after his retirement , at least , the last in 1996 at the CSU list for the local council to stand .

Currently , the association is the 74-year-olds , according to about 40 members .
`` After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we have let the club activities out of respect to rest first . '' This `` thinking period '' was needed to consider `` how it could happen . ''
According to the new chairman Piffl will then go into the conversation with the castle .
Until then , the friends could also make a current mood within their group .
A candidate for the presidency , there is not yet at the moment , Piffl says .
`` But I am confident that somebody will find '' and he does not want to stand , because he has his residence in Bad Toelz .
The new chairman should be a wolf council houses .
The Toelzer wanted to cooperate in the project , `` but very happy to continue . ''
The different positions in terms of reconstruction will be in the eyes of Piffls remain well in the near future .
He acknowledges as a `` missionary '' Dimbath , who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar , already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipedream .
Due to a high level of participation of the population , as well as by volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist magnet .
Piffl : `` I was sceptical at the beginning .
But over time , more and more I have come to believe that it would be useful to advance the project . `` It could be a '' unique selling point `` for the river city .
Here , there is nothing else .
In addition , the project would be through EU subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors fundable , believes Piffl .
`` The idea of the reconstruction , I personally do not simply throw it overboard . '' He hopes that the club moves perhaps on this point .
Their goal is to document the story first , `` is important and good . ''
After that , we could see further .

Renzi sees the government reflects near daily La Repubblica , the appointment of his government team , the favourite current Mogherini as the strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU .
He expects a boost in his `` package '' in Italy .
Last but not least , Renzi hopes the repeatedly risen against him left-wing party base to provide calm , as Mogherini is assigned - albeit more moderate way .

If the PD again today , a better relationship with strong peace movement in the country , with more than 40 percent of the party votes in the EU elections in May , then , as is noted in PD-circles , Federica Mogherini a share .
The representations in Brussels , the new EU High Representative have too little diplomatic experience , so lacking in substance , will mean in the PD .
In Brussels , mistrustful of realistic accents , especially from Poland and the Baltic members , followed her on the crisis in Ukraine and vilified as `` Russia-friendly course . ''
It supports the Russian company Gazprom 's South Stream pipeline through which Russian gas directly , bypassing Ukraine should be transported to Southern Europe , which also serves the energy security of Italy .
In July , Renzi after his term as EU president had commenced , Mogherini went on her first state visit to Moscow .

Back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions and civil rights .
`` Unions are dying just as the middle class jobs , '' Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota , and vice-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , said .
That is why I proudly present together with the civil rights icon John Lewis , the employee empowerment law .
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions , as with other forms of discrimination - and thus stop anti-union-minded forces .
The completion of the national labour law in order to create an opportunity for a discrimination abandoned workers to organize a union representation , in order to sue in a civil court for justice - and in order to receive compensation or penalty payments - is a useful and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards .
In fact , the best way is to suggest to the understanding of what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill , the link to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks , which the unions were suspended in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states across the country , Americans were encouraged in countries around the world to recognise work rights to extend and respect .
There was a time in which millions of Americans remember , when this country democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association mentioned in the same breath .
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy .
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions participated in the creation of a new Japan , using a language that explicitly recognized that the rights of workers are guaranteed of association and collective bargaining and action. ``
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pressed the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that the workers must organize and raise its voice in the new government added a clause explicitly testified : `` The right to form and to safeguard the health and economic conditions and to improve each and every profession or trade .
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it is null and void ; targeted measures are illegal .
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other drafters added a guarantee that everyone has `` the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or '' to join them .
For generations , Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
When this country advising others how to civilian and democratic societies could form , Americans said that the law must be protected on the establishment of a trade union - and that these unions could then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies .
After these rights were under attack in America , is it really wise , to lead the American ideal , according to which the working population must have the right to unite and to have a free and open society .
As pastor , Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago :
History is a great teacher. ``
Now everyone knows that the labour movement did not restrict the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
By raising the living standards of millions , labour miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production .
Those who attack labour forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
History remembers , and that is something we should do .
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights and protection against discrimination in the establishment of employee representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past and simply delivering on the promise of democracy .

The Socialists in France should `` keep their mouths shut and put France in order , '' the most important ally of François Hollande said .
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left , `` to show their love '' for the controversial socialist president , whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval in the vast majority of the French .
The president deserves everyone 's respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
`` It is our duty to remain by their side , '' he said to loud applause .
As reassuring , the prime minister insisted that his government 's controversial 35-hour week in France , despite fierce demands for an easing of regulation of Emmanuel Macrons , the new economy minister , not question .
On Saturday , Mr Hollande had called his Mitsozialisten to stand `` united '' with the government .
But Christiane Taubira , the justice minister , shared a spanner in the works in which she performed at a meeting of rebel Socialist member of parliament and the Socialist party criticised the fact that they take the French `` faith in their future . ''
Marine Le Pen , the far-right leader of the National Front derided the constant infighting of the Socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last more than a few months ?
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes , but Prince Manuel Valls does not either , they are forced to form a new government , if not the old has survived a summer .
`` And also the new autumn or winter is not '' survive , Miss Le Pen told supporters .
She repeated her party 's call for a dissolution of parliament and said that she is confident to emerge as the winner in the early elections and is ready for government .
France 's ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was in the EU elections in May .
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of falling apart before the end of the term , Hollande 's 2017 into several rival factions .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at Sciences Po University , warned that the French would quickly lose patience when the new Socialist government get any improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures .
`` There is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion quickly needs to feel that things are changing , '' he warned .
Otherwise , the situation could deteriorate further .

The tax burden of businessmen in Washington is rising with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax issues for companies in the country increased slightly last year , while accelerating the economic recovery , according to a new study published last week , and the company in the Washington area was no exception .
Businesses in the District , Maryland and Virginia together paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent compared to revenue of $ 26.6 billion in 2012 .
State and local tax burden of enterprises rose by 4.3 percent last year to $ 671 million , compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year , and it was the third year in a row of growth after several years of declining orders in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes increased more than the local taxes , by 4.3 percent , according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for Business Taxation , a tax policy group .
More than half of the revenue of the district , 56 percent , came from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of revenues come from Maryland companies .
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue with 28 percent of company .
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery of the real estate value of companies , researchers , leading to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent .
While a large proportion of these profits from large states such as California , New York and Texas , the process also seems to be true for the Washington area .
Businesses in the District , Maryland and Virginia together paid more than $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year by 4.2 percent .
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in improving state and local tax revenue , because the real estate taxes amount to barely more than one-fifth of the tax issues of companies .
Companies in Virginia and D.C. are paying almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
`` In Maryland , the following happens : A large proportion of real estate , particularly in the fiscal area around D.C. , is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes , '' said Douglas Lindholm , director of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on , for example , the income tax to be able to offer the same services that offer other states .
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not only be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market
Company revenues appear to recover , so the data .
Businesses in the region reported on income taxes for state organizations of $ 2.3 billion compared with $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took a $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
While the trend is heading in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses is not rising uniformly in all three places .
The growth rate in the District met with 4.3 percent of the national average , while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia reported an average tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
Virginia has 6 percent in all three areas , the significantly lower corporate income taxes ( in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates ) .
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the District at relatively high 9,975 per cent .
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local business taxes are required and , overall , a better tax climate than Maryland .
In the study , the District was not investigated .
Despite the advantages of Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
North Carolina passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year .
If the state continues to reach its revenue targets for the coming year , this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of up to 3 per cent by 2017 .
In the meantime , it seems to be small businesses in the Washington area , and it therefore pay more state and local taxes , according to the most recent study .
Corporate taxes and personal income taxes are paid by small businessmen - a transitional structure in which most small businesses are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia increased last year by 20 percent to $ 2.4 billion , a faster rate of growth than the corporate taxes altogether .
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year , with an increase of the general VAT revenues for 2014 , the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters compared to the same period of the previous year .
However , the region could lag behind Washington , if the federal government 's spending cuts affects the labour market in the region .

Exclusive extract from Howard Jacob 's new novel about love and the letter `` J '' hochgelobtem .
You zerflossen , one could best describe it , she slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that you have to stand in the rain .
Occasionally , a woman told him that he was too serious , demanding , intense , aloof and perhaps slightly kratzbürstig .
And then the hand shook him .
Kratzbürstig he knew .
He was stachelig , like hedgehogs , yes .
The last victim of this barbed approach was a very nascent affair for which was promising a relief of boredom of his life than usual , and perhaps even brought him a certain amount of satisfaction .
Ailinn Solo Mons was a trembling , delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island , which was even more isolated and hostile than Port Reuben .
It came with an older companion to the south , Kevern held for her aunt , who had inherited a plot in a damp but heavenly valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley .
For several years , no one had lived in the house .
The pipes were leck , the bathrooms were spiders , slugs have left their mark on all the windows , and believed that they belong to all of this , and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads .
It was like the house out of a children 's story , both menacing and seductive , a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J '' on the long list for the Man Booker Prize is 2014 .
The shortlist will be announced in the coming week .
Kevern and Ailinn holding had sat on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon , and both had been playing a spirit absent in the console , which supplied the country with soothing music and besänftigenden news than the sight of her brown legs crossed reminded him of an old song , one long forgotten black entertainer , which his father had listened with closed blinds in the house .
Your feet are too big .
Due to their own aggressiveness songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
Not banned - Nothing was played so well - just not banned .
It has been successful obsolesziert , like the word obsoleszieren .
The general flavour created what decrees and regulations had never managed , and how the people in the book From-dishwasher-to-millionaire-memoirs , cookery books and romantic novels , so she chose the music for the ballads .
In the euphoria of the day began to play an imaginary piano Kevern and a gross-funny serenade Ailinns big feet to eulogise , sing .
Ailinn understood that .
`` This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called Fats 1971 , '' he told her , and automatically put two fingers to his lips .
It had always done his father to stop the letter J , before he came out of his mouth .
It began as a game between him and his father , when he was still small .
His father had played it with his own father , as he was told .
When you start a word with a J , without putting two fingers on your lips , it will cost you a penny .
It was not a very fun game back then , and it was not very funny .
He knew what was expected of him , that was all .
It had to explain what jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard of any .
Jazz was , even though he was not directly prohibited , not played .
The improvisation was not more modern .
There was only room for one `` if '' in life .
The people wanted to be at the beginning of a melody , where it would end .
Similarly , the mind .
His unpredictability made people nervous .
And Jazz was musically ausgedrückter mind .
Although he was 10 years old , without having heard about Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew something about jazz by the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least he had to explain Ailinn , Fats Waller was black .
At their age , they probably could not remember a time when Popsänger were not black .
Again , no laws or restrictions .
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of the group talent - grateful like fate spared .
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were by temperament and conformation for entertainment and sports , so she sang and ran .
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent , were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were served with the task of ensuring that no family was left without a working telephone service .
What was left of the Polish community , took care of the sewage system ; what was left of the Greeks smashed plate .
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant , whose grandparents left the country quickly than WHAT GESCHEHEN ship IF IT GESCHEHEN ship geschah- for fear of being accused of Feuerschürens , fearing that the flames would consume them next - had Labneh- and shisha-pipe-restaurants opened , consider themselves and were depressed by inaction .
Each according to his abilities .
Because she had heard only ballads , Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that she had just vorgesungen Kevern , could ever be synchronized .
Music is an expression of love .
`` These are not really '' offensive , Kevern said .
Except , perhaps , for people whose feet are too big .
My father has never offended anyone , but he loved this song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security .
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves .
Ailinn still not understood .
Why did your father would love such a thing ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , however , hesitated to show again in its present two fingers to their lips .
You already thought that it was a little odd .
`` It was funny , '' he said instead .
She shook her head in disbelief and impeded Keverns view .
There was nothing else in the whole world to see as their ungekämmtes pitch black hair .
There was nothing that he wanted to see otherwise .
`` If you say '' it , they believe , without conviction .
But that still does not explain why you vorsingst it myself .
She seemed genuinely concerned .
My feet are too big ?
He looked again .
Your feet are not so directly .
Perhaps your ankles , a little bit ...
And you say that you hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
But hate ?
Of course , I do not hate you .
This is just a silly song .
He could have said `` I love you , '' but it was still too early for that .
`` Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you think '' me , he tried it instead .
I am a bit perverse .
That was not right .
It was supposed to be funny .
When he tried to be funny , he was often in trouble because he did not like his father about the soothing charm needed to bezähmen the inherent cruelty in jokes .
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he , Kevern , wanted to be .
Despite his kind eyes .
Ailinn Solo Mons was red and rose from her deck chair , threw the console and buried the wine they were drinking .
Elder flowers , wine , drunkenness was no excuse for him .
In her excitement , she seemed to tremble , like palm fronds in the storm .
`` And your thick head is exactly the reason why I am drawn to office , '' you feel , she said .
Except that I am not even that .
She was tired of him , both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that was in their eyes when they rebelled against him .
They dachte , that he would beat them ?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago , where she was raised , but he had no doubt that it was essentially just like here .
The same vast and icy ocean broke here and there on the shore .
The same confused men with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher after THIS WAS GESCHEHEN ship as it were their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers , moved from pub to pub , always willing to raise a hand against a woman who refused them or derided .
Thick head ?
It would have shown her a big fist , if not farewells .
She only kissing - kissing the most-used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - they were only kissing and then beat .
After Keverns believes this was an unnecessary refinement , because kissing was itself an act of violence .
Ailinn Solo Mons gave him to go through her body .
He arose from the deck chair , like an old man .
They also felt bleiern , but the impact of his grief surprised them .
That was not the end of the world .
They barely knew each other .
She watched him as he departed , as from a room on the upper floor of their companion was watching him - a man , complaining of what he himself had created .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
She felt a sudden pain for him , and men in general , although some have raised their hands against it .
A man turned away from her , his back bent , embarrassed , defeated without fighting spirit - why this was a sight that she seemed to know when she could not remember a single occasion on which she had seen something in the present day ?
When she was alone again , Ailinn Solo Mons looked at their feet .
Several years before the events just told working ESME Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow , non-legislative oversight body for the public mood , with a short talk about the continued violence at low and intermediate level in exactly the areas where the reduction , if not elimination , most likely to be expected , given the money and energy into eradicating such violence had been invested .
`` A lot has been done , and a lot still needs to be done , '' she wrote , `` in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that a thousand wars waged and won most of them , especially in the remote areas and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically felt despite the towering spires of the hedges .
But , it turns out , some properties of erroneous belief .
The higher the tower , it seems , the lower the passion he arouses .
The people crying when listening to sentimentaler ballads , enthralled by stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe strongly in the virtues of marriage and family life , but not only the former rudeness maintains the rural communities as well as our urban fabric in the hand , but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious argument looks at home , in the workplace , on the streets and even on the playing fields .
`` They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration , her mentor meant when he had read the entire report .
I suggest that you read more novels .
ESME Nussbaum lowered its head .
I also have to ask : You are an atheist ?
`` I believe that I have to say no , '' ESME Nussbaum replied .
Are you lesbian ?
Again , ESME invoked their right to privacy and refusal of the statement .
Feminist ? .
Again silence .
`` I do n't ask that , '' Luther Rabinowitz said finally , `` because I would be against atheism , Lesbentum or feminism .
This here is a prejudice-free workplace .
We serve a prejudice-free society .
But certain types of hyper-sensitivity that are perfectly acceptable and commendable , can occasionally results , as you have presented it to distort .
You yourself seem to have prejudices against the church , and those things you describe as `` sneaky '' and `` raw '' could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a natural strength and vitality .
If you continue to beat down on this , WHAT IS GESCHEHEN IF IT IS GESCHEHEN , as if it , if it would have happened would have happened yesterday means to deprive the country of its essential vitality .
For ESME Nussbaum felt , while Rabinowitz said .
Behind his head , repeated an LED sticker in flamingo pink , the advice , the country in the last quarter-century Ofnow or longer .
You Lächeln to their neighbours , you value your partner , you hear ballads go , musicals , you use your phone , you talk , you say that you listen , you agree that you apologize .
Speaking is better than silence , the song is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I understand completely what you want , ESME Nussbaum replied , '' with a quiet voice when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end , `` and I say nothing other than that we are not yet healed as effective as we are deluding ourselves .
My concern is that we may find ourselves without warning about how we repeat the mistakes in THIS WHAT IS GESCHEHEN IF IT IS GESCHEHEN .
This time , however , it is not the other where we miss our anger and our mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands .
In order to indicate a patience .
`` You go too far , '' he said , `` if you describe acts as a '' mistake `` that perhaps our grandparents or not .
You also go too far when you say that they had their `` anger '' and their `` suspicion '' to `` other '' left out .
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position , that we talk about the understanding of the past , such as in the protection of the present , not `` us '' and `` other . ''
There was no `` us '' and there were no `` other . ''
It was a time of disorder , which is all we know .
`` From the daring , if we are honest with ourselves , '' ESME smash , `` no part of society can claim to have behaved well .
I accuse no one .
Whether it was done badly or well , what is done is done .
That was then .
Nothing more needs to be said - and here we agree .
And like any blame must be assigned , so no debt must be repaid if such repayment would be appropriate , and if there was a way to wipe them out .
But what about the past , if we do not learn from it -
The past is that we forget about them .
If I may say something about this
Luther Rabinowitz did not coincide his pyramid .
`` I will consider their report , he said , '' and dismissed them .
The next day , when she went to work as usual , she was run over by a motorcycle driver who described how passers-by , in a sort of `` brutal rage '' on the footpath .

Matthies says : Time for large networking
Given the galloping technological progress which our cosy homes in high-tech threatens to transform switching centers , our columnist Bernd Matthies console themselves with a very familiar electronic accessories .
As I write this , my eye falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener on the phone , and I think : Boah , how retro is that ?
But there is a thought behind it : If the cable is not all listeners , would fly around in a short time , unlike in the House , and that would still be significantly more retro .
In any case applies to the disgust ( `` disgust '' ?
No , typo : Electronic ) sector bought the rule that the world today is the electrical waste of tomorrow - out of date .
And who , for example , still has a CRT television sets in the living room , simply saying that he basically rejects television .
Why is this ?
Because it reminds us of the Ifa Andrängen on radio tower this week our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics .
The layman , before washing machines and CD players dominated blindly , not even now understands the purpose of the devices with incredible eitlem Expertensprech are spread before him : `` Connected home , Build IT , Healthcare and New Technologies '' promises the press office .
Yes , it 's ?
What is there to talk with people who seem to spread such Quark voluntarily ?
In fact , it is for about 20 years , above all , that we should always connect our house .
To make the yogurt even after being ordered to fire alarm tells us on holiday to the Maldives that it burns grad in the work room .
And it would be wonderful if the air conditioning from the office to our early arrival ... ?
Yes , but this requires an air-conditioning .
But certainly a dream will soon come true : We raise our watch , telling her `` sucking ! '' - and home of the vacuum cleaning robot drives off .
Misleading .
It all amounts to nothing less than a revolution : `` The boundaries between white and brown goods blurring '' raunt an industry expert , you can connect the washing machine with a pair of headphones , the steam sends nao the weather forecast and the glasses will show how long the pizza in the oven needs , what is not , however , because we are in a traffic jam .
From the day-to-day practice , we also know that if a cutting-edge device is really urgently needed once the battery is guaranteed .
But another reason is that the spiral cable will survive on the phone the next radio shows .

The statement that the plans were first announced in July , are `` definitely untrue , Pötzl 's bodypaintings .
At the same time , he points out that it is not in the plans `` Vorfestlegungen or decisions , '' but `` preferences '' would be it .
Also , the need for the expansion of the narrow road to the castle would be less dramatic than feared by Medaus .
From a nine-metre-wide road and not talk .
It comes after current state of 5.50 metres , a metre wider than before , `` explains Pötzl .
The argument of Medau-operators that their free and own parking spaces in the future will only be used by students of the university , do not want to accept Pötzl .
It is not at all with parks , because that , like other public car parks now intelligently Resolve .
Residents to think
The crèche mountain dwarf , which is located on the site and on its doorstep , the approach would lead to the parking deck along , will be affected , according to the university president , `` no . ''
Instead , he has to remember that `` this is not just about the nursery , but also for the residents at the Friedrich-Streib Street and the 800 pupils of the nearby secondary school .
So it is about much more than special interests , Medau , `` Pötzl 's bodypaintings .

Smart ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of uni-textbooks for many students more than $ 1,000 per year will be considered a fast second semester student Matt Schroeder , a clever idea of austerity .
He invented a surrogate system for books by students of higher semesters and a nominal compensation offered to delay the sale .
`` My maths book usually costs $ 180 , but I got it for $ 10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-biscuit , '' said Schroeder , 19 , of the Covenant College in Georgia .
The books needed for the last semester would have cost $ 430 , he said .
He spent $ 120 .
The College Board said that on average , the students spend more than $ 1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials for students , however , there are various options for cost containment .
Online stores and creative approaches , such as the Schroeders are becoming the solution of choice for students .
Renting textbooks will be more popular , and so students can use a book for a semester , often at a considerably lower price than at the time of purchase .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university bookstores , said that the hiring of textbooks have doubled since 2011 .
In industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores last spring semester was hired , said Vice-President Neebos Tevor Meyer .
Less than half of all the textbooks will , according to the trade association , National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores .
Here is the ABC for the best deals .
Buy online
Several new books online cost only a third of the price for which they are in the campus bookstore .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus '' vno Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be purchased in a specialised retailer Chegg.com textbook for $ 239,99 .
Buy used
If one of the notes of others or normal usage tracks , used books are a good option .
`` Calculus '' is used to having Chegg.com for 93,49 $ .
Matte Casaday , 25 , a graduate student at Brigham Young University , says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used copy of `` Strategic Media Decisions : Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business . ''
The book was sold for $ 48 .
Academics like Ingrid Bracey , head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to check with their professors , whether previous editions are admissible .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work .
In such cases , older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition .
In addition to Chegg and Amazon also helped .com by eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books .
Renting
The hiring of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well , remember to return it , and you keep the books after completion of the course .
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased books .
For example , a student might `` Calculus '' for the duration of a term rent for about $ 20 .
Find out about the rules of the business where you rent , even beyond the criminal charges that may be incurred for writing , or usage tracks .
Renters beware : If you do not return the book to the criminal charges , even the price of a new book .
E-books
Even e-books , rather than traditional textbooks are an option .
Sometimes , these books are actually rented by an electronic license is provided for a certain period of major retailers such as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc .
At Chegg `` Calculus '' for 6 months rent for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students often find in literature courses , the best deals , because these days many classics can be downloaded for free scientific and engineering science textbooks , can be very expensive .
Look around in any case .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon visit the pepper Dine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for price determination for books , because you can be so sure , finding the right textbook .
And in an online order , you should verify , Gault , whether the book is actually available .
He learned this lesson the hard way .
He bought a book for four weeks and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore .

Delayed diagnosis and a lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother , James made a video tribute to her mother , who died of ovarian cancer in 2007 .
For women in rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities .
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians , when ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 2005 , and found that only 25 percent of five years after diagnosis were still alive .
Research Director Susan Jordan from QIMR Mountain Hofer Medical Research Institute , said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study by 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
Kleine STUDY : New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer .
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years .
Dr Jordan said that a woman 's age at diagnosis , type of ovarian cancer , the previous illnesses , as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival .
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced further at the time of diagnosis , the survival rate is the lowest .
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study by 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
Although the study examined why women living outside the city , more likely to die of ovarian cancer , Dr. Jordan suggests a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors .
`` This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists , and these are mostly to be found in larger towns , '' she said .
Despite the improvement of medical services to counter the distances a bit , she suggested , as a possible remedy , a reinforcement of the service by doctors flown to give professionals the opportunity to provide women denser at the place of residence , as well as treatment programs for people outside of their region .
Dr Jordan said that the study found regardless of geographic status of a poor long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .

China refuses to allow Hong Kong the right to elect government , protesters swear vengeance
On Sunday , the Chinese Parliament decided , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election of Hong Kong 's electorate .
This approach probably fired the long-announced protests in Hong Kong 's business district , while militants initiated the planning and mobilization on this within a few hours after the announcement .
The decision of the Chinese People 's Congress basically allows the Communist leaders did not reject all candidates loyal to Beijing .
`` This is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , '' legal expert Emily Lau , leader of the Democratic Party said .
That is not what Beijing had promised .
They have lied to the people of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In his defense of the Chinese decision , Li Fei , deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , said that the approval of public nominations for the election of Hong Kong 's government `` would be chaotic . ''
Since Cuba 's control over Hong Kong in 1997 , when Britain , the Chinese , Beijing has promised to let the people elect their government , in 2017 .
The Chinese government on Sunday presented the decision as a democratic breakthrough , because it gives the people of Hong Kong a direct electoral law , but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese government maintains the flow through a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing .
After a new clause only candidate `` with a love for country and love for Hong Kong '' should also be permitted .
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests in Hong Kong have taken place for many years .
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong , the movement , Occupy Central With Love and Peace , whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district unless Beijing allows no genuine universal suffrage .
On Sunday evening , were within a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
During the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement has reached a new phase of civil disobedience , and they mounted waves of protests in the coming weeks .
However , they made no details on this , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
In an online statement shared with the organisers that the movement `` the occupation of the central district , only as a last resort to , an action that is to be held only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted , and there is no other choice .
We are sorry to have to say that all dialogue possibilities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for days for the announcement of Beijing , and it was on the Sunday before the government building tighter security measures , including police and barricades .
The unrest is aggravated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city .
The influx of people from the mainland increases the competition for products and services .
In addition , the fear is that Hong Kong 's values , such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure from Beijing .
Some criticised the demonstrations by the Occupy Central movement because they are a business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - is eroding .
`` The protests , which they say could cause serious economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long it continues said , '' legal expert regime Ip , who has long criticized the move .
We do n't want to stoke fears that Hong Kong gets out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
China 's state-controlled media also reported recently on democracy activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
This summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights on which discussion was attended by people - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
In July , tens of thousands of people in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations took part in the history of the region .

Putin demands from Kiev , the inclusion of `` state-talks '' with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin , according to Russian media reports , demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins with negotiations on the `` statehood '' of the breakaway region .
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow clarified later that Putin had not meant that they are under the control of the separatist regions of eastern Ukraine will be a part of Russia , but that his status needs to be redefined to Ukraine to give the Russian-speaking region , the power to represent their rights and interests .
Putin 's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents , however , fits into his since the beginning of the riots five months ago , apparently persecuted strategy : Aid for the separatists during the adoption of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to the newly proclaimed region Novo Rossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West .
In an interview with the state-owned TV station Channel One , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18 .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently described the area as `` Novo-Rossija collected '' or `` New Russia , '' a term that recalls the revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those Ukrainian politicians during the campaigns for the elections on 26 Okt . and government groups of civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope to attack early peace talks `` are caught '' in their illusions , told Itar-Tass .
`` We need to immediately begin detailed discussions , '' not only technical issues but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the south-eastern Ukraine to protect the interests of the people who live there , he said .
Peskow said that Putin 's reference to the statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas , that their cultural and linguistic rights have been compromised .
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions , Peskow said .
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskow said , `` because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but '' an internal conflict in Ukraine .
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the `` misinterpretation '' of Putin 's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the direct Annektion Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulties to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine , since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from before the conflict showed a large majority of the remaining in Ukraine .
The autonomy , which was raised by Russian diplomats at international forums , would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate your own trade agreements and foreign relations , and about the Kremlin 's de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory of Crimea .
The absorbed five months ago in the Black Sea peninsula is also the home port for the bulk of the Russian navy , as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region .
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines , factories and foundries , who make key components for the Russian military .
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech at the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after fresh elections - should consider amendments to the constitution that allow greater control will be given to the respective areas of their finances and the status of the languages .
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , which Moscow is accused of arming and incitement .
Putin 's recent call on Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing , followed by another invasion by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks across the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov has invaded the eastern Ukraine .
The Russian-backed separatists took over in the coup , according to Ukrainian security official fears is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea , the control of Nowoasowsk .
For this reason , massive civilian and military preparations are under way to fortify Mariupol , a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants , which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea .
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for urgent action to create a further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that is independent for 23 years .
`` We are nearing the point of no return , '' warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit agreed no concrete action , the leaders called for the drafting of further sanctions against Russia , which Ukraine unspezifizierten escalation in a crisis is to enter into force .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk , after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers broke into the Donetsk region last week to support the beleaguered separatists , Colonel Andriy Lysenko , spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council report said in Kiev on Saturday .
Probably the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been taken a week ago on Ukrainian territory , Lysenko said on Sunday .

On the bouncy castle with the castle garden festival there was on Saturday .
The concept of the organisers .
Despite the strong Regengusses on Saturday evening , an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden .
At times , the doors had to be stopped .
`` It was annoying , '' Ron Sem , one of the organizers said .
Salzwedel , the light and fun .
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula .
The Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is to radiate light during the day and in the evening with various shows .
Oh , and the fun comes from alone anyway .
This was the early Saturday , when the first visitors had gone to the open air .
A feast for all generations , the organizers promised .
And that is them .
Around the food stalls on the castle garden lawn Salzwedeler , but also guests from both had it .
She watched the first live performances , wippten with the foot to the beat , enjoyed cool drinks - in short : Pure relaxation and enjoyment were called for .
And across the generations. ``
While some on blankets on the extra lümmelten angekarrten white sand at the beach bar , with a quarter of wine in the wine shop will , `` raged on the bouncy castle , which was a big attraction for the younger guests .
But even when children 's face painting , the volunteers had to do in the truest sense of the word , all hands to the crowd and to conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces .
The older children used the table football tables or took part in a skateboard-workshop , which the good foot-crew of Salzwedel .
Until the heavy rain came .
Just before 5.30 p.m. he prasselte to visitors , especially families sought the vastness and nest .
But the attraction of the festival did not diminish .
`` There were '' more people than expected , Ron Sem , who spoke of a `` success across the board , '' said .
That is why a repeat of the large party to anything next year .
Although it must be worked on content and size of the event , Sem made a first record on Sunday against the popular vote .
He described as angry that the doors had to be halted in the meantime .
Obviously , the security company had been booked with too few forces .
The result : Some people who had already paid for was no longer on the site .
The response was very good .
In a first cautious estimate of Salzwedeler participation spoke of about 1200 visitors who tummelten in the castle garden .
There were problems with the sound .
The Salzwedeler hip hop band blocks `` n '' Rox broke their presence so unnerved .
The engineers were not able to create a reasonably decent sound .
The planned Ali Baba Restaurant lounges could not be established , because the tents for a puncture to Salzwedel .
`` But next year they will be , '' according to the organizer .
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was the visitor numbers more than succeeded .
And in bad weather. ``
However , the organisers have made a number of mistakes that will have to be forgiven for the first time , but removed in the second edition .
Even in the social network Facebook , the organisers need to criticism .
`` Sorry , but for 12 euros you have expected more , '' says Melanie Meier on the event page .
`` You have '' unfortunately you a bit , says Ele Zimmermann at the same place .
Others see the initial problems are not quite so closely .
I think it is very good that some chat not only stupid , but also really try to put something on their feet .
Hats off ! , `` writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula .
Now a year is the time to address these criticisms .

The hellish year tenth of the survivors of Beslan : Ten years have passed since the horrific siege of the school as the children caught up in it today .
Ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were taken by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan in southern Russia as hostages .
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world .
We have returned to Beslan to identify some of the victims who had escaped death in the bestiality in the classroom .
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school in Beslan in which 334 people were killed , including 186 children , warned the heroic survivors last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
As a fanatical Islamist terrorists , children and parents on 1 September 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , captured and killed , that seemed like the evil means .
The tragedy united West and East in disgust , and then turned in surprisingly action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
Ten years later , we have returned to Beslan to identify some of the victims who had escaped death in the bestiality in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome the odds , though the memory of these terrorist hell will follow them forever .
Their best hope ?
The fact that the war ravaging Ukraine now - and where children die like them - now an end .

Completely confused Aida after her mother Larissa , now 40 years old .
Both were thought to be dead , but she survived .
`` One woman told me that I should run for my life , but I could n't , '' Aida said .
My legs were blood flows .
I stood up and climbed again to look for my mother .
A soldier brought them in safety .
After a series of operations , they considered themselves to be completely cured , but said yesterday : `` Three months ago , the pain returned .
I am afraid that I have to be operated on again .
Some shrapnel shards are still in my knee .
Their aim is now to be a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors .
`` This tragedy has changed my life , but it has not broken to me , '' she says fighting fun .
`` This happened to me , and this can not be changed .
Once a year , I always go to the gym to remind me of those who have stayed there .
My friends and I try to talk about it on other days .
The pain is too big .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together when we were small , and dreamed of going to school together .
`` I do not want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career .
I think to a family later .
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it , although the memory is weak , something every year .
I am pleased that many people in the world still recall with horror , and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere .
When I see the pictures of me online , I zurückklettere in school , I think that a lot of people see it for the first time , to understand our disaster and help to ensure that this does not happen again .
The boy , who fled through the bullets , in the view that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school ( Russians go to school with 7 years ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother , Tamara .
After seven years , he said : `` Mom told me that I should come to me if there was an explosion , and hold their hand . ''
After an explosion , he thought she would die .
She said to him : `` Run . ''
Full of fear , they could be dead , he fled , and saw on the way a wine of infant , took it by the hand and fled with bullets .
His father , Vladimir , who concluded his son outside , said : `` Damir told me that his mother has died .
He said : `` I could not save them . ''
In fact , according to Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital , on the assumption that their son had died .
After its reunification , she said : `` I wept with joy .
I could not believe it .
He ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( now dissolved ) from the newspaper News of the World to obtain by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie , the title of a Barnardo 's Children 's Champion .
`` This horror is watching you every day , but I wish I could stop with the reminder , '' he said yesterday .
But I can say that in my memory it will be fainter .
I know that I immediately after man ever threw away all my toy guns .
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me .
`` I am not afraid to go back to the gym , but I do not think me about .
I remember these kids with whom I played in the yard , and who did not .
We never say that they have been killed or dead .
We say that they are in the sports hall .
I remember very well my trip to London , particularly in the toy shop , where I could choose what I wanted , and the ride in an open top car .
But now he has caused anxiety around places like Ukraine , where wars , the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered .
This horror haunts you every day , but I wish I could stop to remember .
`` I am so sorry for all those who are suffering under the atrocities , '' said Damir , who worked as a volunteer last week in a monastery .
So I want to help .
One day , I want to go to the police and hope that they take me next year at the training academy .
His mother , Tamara , 48 , said : `` Thirty-seven children were killed from our neighbourhood , you can imagine it ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there was simply no children who were able to set up and run around , and this silence lasted for many months .
She remembers vividly of her trip to London with Damir .
The people of London cried when I told our story .
At the time , I understood how people can understand on the other side of the world , our feelings and show their support .
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004 .
I wish I could talk to Cherie and tell her just that 10 years have passed , but I still like to meet her and her husband to me in London , and how that Damir and has helped me .
I remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and phoning them all local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant , Damir shot with his water pistol at them and they ran away and played with him .
And that was just a month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British are so readily shared our pain and support us .
She said : `` I always think that this world is not in these 10 years , become better .
In Ukraine , the war continues , and people are dying every day , and I believe that many children have been killed and killed .
These are just such children as ours .
I think that for many , the war is a part of the messages they hear when they are bored or busy with something else .
I know what these people feel , the whole horror .
And I ca n't stop to feel that .
Nothing has changed , the people still want to kill themselves and that is so sad .
Damir was and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not at all aggressive or angry .
He is not looking for revenge , for example , he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities .
I know he does n't like it , but he has six close friends from the class , and they sometimes go into the gym and light candles there .
When he was small he suffered , including - I remember how he was sometimes on the sofa , the face turned from us for hours on end .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I remember how he threw all of his weapons and other military toys . Damir is now 17 , handsome , bigger than me , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that several hours I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again .
When I recovered myself after the explosion and saw the legs I came to me , and the hell looked around me , with body parts lying around .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell .
`` I remember that I called him , '' Damir , according to go on , `` but I was so sure that he had not heard me .
But he has heard it , and he ran away .
And so life goes on , unlike that of many others , for us .

The boy , whose terrible picture after the siege became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Comfort : The Beslan-survivors ( Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004 , an image of Georgy today
His face was scarred by blutüberströmtes fear when he ran for his life , while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates .
His image was one of the most shocking images of the barbarity of Beslan .
His mother , Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had dropped him for his first day of school , before she rushed off to get their older son , Vladimir .
`` I left the court for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it and my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone , '' she remembers .
Not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives from us , but all of them were killed .
Only my Georgy managed to survive .
The closer the date comes , the more difficult it is to remember and to talk about it .
There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think that it was a long time ago , I think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from those days have me constantly .
No one will ever forget that , I promise you .
Eindringlich : The image of Georgy ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized in a statue ( right ) .
I remember that on that day ( so wanted to go to school , and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher .
I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on television .
And now there is even a statue of a weeping born in San Marino .
Georgy sees the image , and it 's hidden at home on the bookshelf .
I understand that , but I also think that the people around the world feel our pain , thanks to this image .
Georgy says today : `` It is important that such a thing can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we will ever know the truth .
People always look at such tragedies and never know the truth .
And now they are examining the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused it ?
This world is becoming something awful .
`` I can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask the people , nobody wants a war , so how is this happening ?
Ten years of nothing in such pain .
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit .
It has attacked my health and I still feel it .
About three or four years I have had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it was better .
Later , I went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day .
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed .
That is why I always go to the gym when the moves closer to 1 September .
I would like to pay my tribute to my old childhood friends .
It is hard for me to go to the gym , but I have to do it .
I am not a victim , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I am not bemitleide .
My life goes on .
I have concluded this year , the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz .
I am going to be a heart surgeon .
My first choice was an education in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health has not allowed it .
I wanted to fight for my country , but this will not happen .
Georgi Fanijew ,
The boy , who survived , though he was imprisoned at the feet of a murderous terrorists
A miracle : Georgy Fanijew was during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb , which was mounted at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
It really is a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel it , as if it were yesterday , '' Georgy , who wanted to go to the FSB , the intelligence officer says , but this could do for his health damage due to the siege .
It 's still with me , there is nothing that I have left behind me .
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that this is not true .
`` In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I actually felt a little better after that , but I can not forget it .
And I would like to forget .
2005 - a year later - was the first and only time that I went back to the gym .
I lost consciousness .
I will never go back there again and ask me not to show you where I have sat in this famous image .
Survivor : Georgy Fanijew today , with a photo of himself in a hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry him with me every day .
My friends know that I do not think like them or talk about it and they never asked me after school .
Physically , I feel good .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but now I can run well .
But because of my health , I was unable to study at the FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg , as I wanted to .
I have my documents , including those submitted medical and she responded that it was not possible .
My second passion were the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been there two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals `` from cats to cows . ''
He said : `` I knew that I would never tell my children from my experiences .
Children should know nothing about it and they should not suffer it too , of course .
His mother , Marina , 42 , said : `` The pain never leaves me .
He is in my soul , worse when the anniversary approaches .
I will go to the celebrations for the memory .
I know that Georgy will not go .
There needs to be much more violent for him , because he was there , and I do not .
I waited for him at home and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me , here in Beslan are all drawn from it .
It remains in us .
Georgy is now an adult , but the horror is still in him .
It is difficult to accept that , if something happens to one so Unfaires .
He is a boy , he loves sports , but he could not attend because of his knee .
He was operated on several times , he can run , but no sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50 % , but you can never completely overcome and forget it .
This terrible experience will haunt us forever .
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege , and that only reinforces my pain .
I have lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were dear to me .
My son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that God could use me , but my heart cries for the killing .
I know of families where the children were born , but also by widows who have never married .
It is hard to accept that there is life , even if you do not want that .
I shall never forget how my heart jumped on me when I saw him in the hospital .
And now I , what is going on in the world - wars in other regions .
What are these people ?
Why do they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it .
We used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
People and children are suffering , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine already , and many are killed .
If we just take all these rebels and could throw - as far away as possible .

Stewart drove earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch into the wall and had to get it repaired the right side of his car .
`` I am acting today with fairly good hopes for a good result , '' said Johnston , and added : `` It is not easy . ''
Not long after the second accident , Stewart was loaded into the trailer , and the team had packed and was ready to depart .
Stewart could be three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit another driver on an ash track race in the north of the state of New York , and killed .
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit .

Garden centres are falling house owner figures
The decline , coupled with a greater decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could mean that garden centres are losing tens of thousands of pounds a year , if today 's young consumers , according to a study by the HTA reports , as set out in the Financial Times , `` core age group for garden products . ''
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount , the people with home for their garden .
The increase in the number of people who live in areas of high urbanisierten without gardens , the popular procedure to asphalt more front gardens to park purposes and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the sector , where almost £5 billion a year in sales will be implemented .
In Greater London , where the percentage of home owners from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years , the lowest spending on garden products are reported per household .
The HTA and the Royal horticultural Society indicate that housing for rent or small gardens do not mean that people can draw any plants .
Guy barter , chief horticultural adviser to the RHS said : `` Container gardeners , for example , is very popular with tenants because their plants in a move can take . ''
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the `` golden age '' of the garden retailers due to rising numbers of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s .
He also predicted for this year , an improved market situation because of the better weather after harsh weather in March and April of last year .

Blocks celebrate their 50th anniversary ,
The protection association `` fir forest '' Berngau from 12 to 14 September , celebrates his 50-year-old foundation .
In full swing at the club fir forests protect the preparations for the 50-year-old establishment party from 12 to 14 September .
On Friday , 12 September , a large entertainment evening with the group `` village rockers . ''
On Saturday , the big Boll is shooting at 6 p.m .
Then , `` the mood in the large marquee evening with '' STOA Palatine pointed Buam .
The brass band music
Highlights of the festive divine service on Sunday and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large procession are at 2 p.m .
In the afternoon , the distribution of federal and Gauschießens .
A pretty sight of the 25 women will be stuck with their Dirndln .
It is the brass band Berngau .
The auspices were Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert for arable .
The original designation `` protect society fir forest Berngau '' dates back to 1907 , when the club was established on 21 March on the `` social entertainment through exercise in Zimmerstutzen- and small-bore shooting . ''
In 1937 , the Nazi regime had prompted the dissolution of the association .
As recently as 1964 , 19 young men have found themselves who have taken on 30 April in the `` new '' protect Luke `` fir forest '' Berngau .
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club and protect champions through a difficult early period in which it was mainly about finding a club locally and to install the Schießbetrieb .
Back in the autumn of 1965 , protect the club started in the pub `` '' Reading `` with two teams in the round competitions .
In subsequent years , the marksmen were organized in seven teams established in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga .
The club records purzelten annually and the magic figure of 380 rings has been achieved for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier .
Just as the performance of active shooters have increased , the membership numbers have developed positively .
After the local association `` '' Reading `` is no longer sufficient to protect the needs of a modern society , the former chief executive , has been under the leadership of John Rinn decided to create in the basement rooms of the new '' country inn Härteis `` a future home .
After a performance of 2700 hours pastor Strasser for granted on May 8 , 1988 , the new rooms to protect the religious blessing .
One of the great highlights in team history was surely the 44th Gauschießen , coupled with the solemn consecration of the new stand flag in July 1991 .
On 23 and 24 April 1994 , the association has to protect his 30-year-old founding anniversary .
A Böllergruppe was founded in 1995 .
Was Josef Schmalzl Böllerreferent .
A major challenge for the `` requires '' and for the club as a whole , the orientation of the Bavarian Böllertreffens was 2005 .
In many hours of volunteer work , the association members last year have modernized the rooms and the courtyard in Berngauer Schießanlage and thus brought to the latest state of the art .
Eleven teams in competitions rounds
You can also see the sporting achievements of the association .
There are currently 11 teams participating in the lap competitions : Six air rifle teams , an air pistol team , a sport pistols KK1 , a youth and two AH-teams .

Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort , change the nature of things , even in such a huge organisation like the NHS .
As a consulting physician anesthesia , he devoted his career to save the hospital , both the agony of the disease and the ordeal of treatment .
Among his patients , remembers his wife , was an MI6 staff , with the devastating effects of torture had to live .
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and disease are important to doctors , while the cases are mostly preoccupied with something quite different : Pain .
One day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose ordeal began .
`` I have felt '' not me , `` he wrote in May of this year .
I had difficulties to raise me .
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms , he noted that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations .
`` I want it all now rather than later , '' he noted .
When Juliet for a week on a business trip , Lawson felt quite unusually , and worried for no reason .
Was something in the air .
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest .
Just two weeks ago , he had been skiing in the French Alps .
The result of the X-ray examination before .
He suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer of the breast skin , the lungs via the skin .
As with most cancers , the exact trigger is often difficult to determine .
While some smokers suffering from lung cancer , for example , have not been all lung cancer before smoking .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost all cases , the underlying cause is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fibrous material , which was once seen as a `` wonder material '' but now recognized as lethal .
For most of us , mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore as easy .
Asbestos is a product of the past .
The most dangerous Asbesttyp has been used in Britain since the 1960s , when the industry committed voluntarily to use them .
Even where he was employed , only people in certain sectors were working directly with the fabric - plumbers , builders , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
As an industrial hazardous material from a different time , he now seems to be little concern .
But this complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it seems , is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom-epidemic .
There are more deaths from be mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , so many people to this disease than die in road accidents .
The annual numbers of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and estimated future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are now witnessing the deadly effects , although asbestos is illegal for years ( all types of asbestos were banned in 1999 ) , is that an be mesothelioma develops only after decades .
And the scourge of be mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and still is , in the houses in which we live , the offices where we work , the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop .
And therefore be mesothelioma knows no class barriers , financial limitations , profession or age .
The privileged bastions of the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are not a protected space .
The Parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated .
Even in the hospitals , in which we are supposed to be healthy , have already been identified as a result of this deadly Karzinogens herd .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was not a plumber .
It was difficult for him to imagine where he could possibly have come in contact with asbestos .
Then he found it .
`` It looks as if it was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy 's Hospital , where I completed six years of my education , '' he wrote .
All of them - students , nurses , doctors and doorman - use the tunnels .
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same disease ?
Unfortunately , he was unable to answer that question , at least in part .
`` Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy 's Hospital '' and that `` in the last five years suffering from mesothelioma , in 2010 , he wrote in a letter , '' I am the last one who still lives. ``
How many of us are still ill ?
Andrew Lawson be mesothelioma at the age of 48 years has been diagnosed .
When he died on 17 February of this year , he was 55 .
It was an unusually long time for survival .
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after diagnosis .
The disease is always fatal .
We can therefore only repeat Lawson 's question : `` How many of us will fall ill ? ''
The UK 's leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 if the asbestos epidemic is expected to arrive in the UK to a standstill , a total of 90,000 of the disease have fallen victim .
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die .

A quick look at the files of the courts to which the victims are often due to damages , shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread .
In June of this year , Marks & Spencer , for example , admitted to have exposed asbestos Janice Allen negligent way .
She worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old than when she began her work in M & S .
Now she has two children in their twenties .
They `` Before this thing , '' says , `` I had never heard of mesothelioma , I really did n't do anything about asbestos .
I never thought that this would affect me .
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that the notion of asbestos is not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name stems from the word `` Asbestiform '' , a description of the fibre structure , which makes the polymer tough and flexible .
Three of the six were used in the construction industry .
Chrysotile asbestos , also known as white asbestos , is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings .
It has been used for roof tiles , floor tiles , pipe insulations , boiler insulation , even for brake pads in cars .
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos , but nonetheless by the EU and the WHO considered `` high health risk '' with possible fatal outcome .
The more dangerous brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that there is a `` clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten . ''

Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual .
He has presented a study of those concerned , given that a significant proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or in the home `` was probably caused by asbestos exposure in the environment . ''
A large proportion of these contacts , according to his statement is based on the `` normal use and aging '' of our buildings .
It looks as though no one could expect to be safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which studied the palace of Westminster , shows how people could be at the heart of the government , unknowingly have been exposed to the substance .
Goddard in 2009 reported that the service shafts and pipes behind the committee rooms of the House were contaminated with asbestos , the lethal fibers could be created by something as harmless as `` strong air movements . ''
MPs are often accused of having to look after their own interests , but in this case it looks as if the opposite is true .
While the management of the Parliamentary Work Service insisted that the Westminster Palace , a `` clean health certificate '' have received , it is now undisputed that cost £1 billion to be spent over several years , to renovate the Parliament , to modernize the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos , and that after the 2015 general election , the MEPs are more likely in the nearby QE2-conference meetings will be on the green benches at Westminster .
The Goddard report also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos is not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions . ''
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
All we can do now is wait. ``
A person who could never determine the contact with asbestos exactly Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
As Andrew Lawson suggested the 50-year-old Abbott , who during his work in hospitals was exposed to the asbestos .
`` I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were decided positively , '' he says , `` but I can not prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to remember all the places where they have worked , and to the data .
What he remembers of the day is still just at the beginning of December 2009 , when he received a kind of Fieber .
He was 45 , and conducted an operation just late in the evening .
Suddenly , I had chills .
It came suddenly .
I felt horrible .
I thought the ride home not to create more .
As a doctor , Abbott knew the pain come from the breast skin , the skin around his lungs .
But , like Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma .
He was not a month to work .
Doctors made verwunderte x-rays of his chest and anchor Pleurakathether , in order to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory .
His complaints , however , remained without a diagnosis .
His health stabilized slowly , and he returned to his job .
From time to time , however , the symptoms returned , often after physical activity and heavy breathing .
In 2011 , Abbott 's a patient with similar symptoms in his practice , and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But even now , Abbott combined this with his own case .
After all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection was clear in this case .
In September 2011 , Abbotts condition again deteriorated and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray pictures to a group of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time , a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the decor of ribs and chest fur .
I am an optimist .
I am mostly just go , `` he says .
To be honest , I had not even made me so many worries .
But Rachel , my wife was worried .
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year : `` They told me that it was mesothelioma . ''
Graham Abbott : Mesothelioma diagnosis
Suddenly , Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses , one of whom advised him to get a lawyer .
Only now , he realised the extent of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was very widespread , '' particularly in large public buildings , where pipes were insulated with asbestos , he said .
The people who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now .
And so now be mesothelioma strikes younger people who have not worked in the traditional professions .
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation layer beneath the earth in hospitals , so patients were more likely to not exposed to the substance .
But many people who ate in pedestrian tunnels changed from one building to another ( such as Andrew Lawson ) or in underground restaurants ( such as Graham Abbott often did ) , most likely to come in contact with toxic substances .
It turns out that the patients for several decades after the war hospitals were potentially lifesaving , but life-threatening for the doctors .
He is still .
Students from their Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
And it is not only hospitals .
Asbestos was due to its fabulous insulating and flame properties often used in offices , shops , libraries and town halls .
Even schools .
In fact , many people have probably had the first contact with asbestos in the classroom .
Across the country , thousands of chemistry lessons , pupils have parked their Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
On the issue of asbestos sites is now often mentioned in schools .
And while innocent objects in our houses , such as floor plates or shingle roofs are included by default as asbestos .
`` It 's an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our properties , '' Andrew Morgan , said the lawyer , who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy 's Hospital .
In one case , the only contact , who imagined an affected woman , was the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970s .
So you , as you continue your garden shed .
The effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
`` It takes a while to process it , Mr Abbott says .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing .
Two weeks ago I was in practice .
Then I knew that I go and had to concern myself with myself .
Well , I will not see another Christmas .
The biggest difficulty with the perspective of the position of a doctor to a patient .
Like countless patients before him , he remembers how he was overwhelmed by all the information with which he had to come .
`` It was very difficult to absorb all this , '' he says .
`` I asked my doctor how long I have ? ''
And it gave me about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , `` Oh well , I will not see another Christmas .
That 's `` then . ''
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself that caused the deadly cancer is .
Most cases of mesothelioma caused by asbestos exposure .
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres .
If the asbestos is infamous and resound to the fibers , they can look at the breast skin , the skin around the lungs set around .
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations .
`` The problem is with the inhalierten needle-shaped asbestos fibers , '' says Professor Tom Treasure , a heart/thorax doctor who in 2001 to Guy 's Hospital .
The hospital , by Andrew Lawson claimed that it has exposed him to asbestos , ironically , is now a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely to face during their training at the hospital of the asbestos .
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , Treasure says , `` they are pushed by the breathing process , where the skin is .
By nature , it is invasive from the beginning .
The usual options for other cancers do n't work so well for mesothelioma .
For example , the effectiveness of an operation is hotly contested .
Some say that it is worth a try .
Treasure denies .
`` It is not the breast skin '' cut out , he says .
They do not come around with a knife .
Meanwhile , the cancer is `` not very well to chemotherapy , '' which shows the `` impact , '' but not cure .
`` Sometimes there are long-term survivors , '' says Treasure .
But in the end , they all die .
Fortunately , some patients actually live a long time , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott still struggling .
After he had contacted mesothelioma , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who , four years after his diagnosis , a one-man support and consulting office for Mitbetroffene .
`` Hello , cancer center , '' he imagined happily on calls .
`` He was '' very positive , `` Abbott says .
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active .
Originally , Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy , which would last four months and is expected to extend its life by only a month .
`` I was desperate , '' he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson , however , managed to make things in a slightly more positive light. ``
Following the advice of several doctors decided Abbott , his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski , cardiac-thoracic specialist at Guy 's .
`` We had an advantage by the fact that I had to be referred , I called and got an appointment , '' admits Graham .
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment .
Money is crucial to-be mesothelioma sufferers , the best available therapies to exercise .
But if those treatments fail , eventually , inevitably , many people are of a different financial concern - the future of the families that they left behind .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher water House LLP .
`` It 's been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health , '' says Morgan .
But what changed in the 1960s , it was realized that even a very low burden posed a health risk .
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy 's Hospital finally put their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full compensation '' because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his contact was a mesothelioma asbestos on the guy 's back .
After the investigation into his death , a spokesman for the guy 's , however , confirmed that the asbestos fibres were removed from the basement area in the 1990s. ``
It was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How can be removed asbestos
In fact , it is to-be mesothelioma sufferers who are seeking compensation , a huge problem , the deadly asbestos exposure to a company or a job , usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those who oppose claims to know that the time is for them , but certainly not with the prosecutor .
In response , there have been significant new legislation earlier this year that it makes for easier Mesotheliom-victims to claim compensation , even though their former employers are no longer detectable .
The law has established a fund sponsored by the insurance industry by £350 million for those diagnosed after July 2012 , show a contact , but will be able to sue anyone .
In these cases , the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process would appeal to them - about £120,000 .
About 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom-affected that £350 million a `` very good job '' of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal from insurers for insurers , '' he says , and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone away and mesothelioma patients-businesses find and normally they could sue .
Even Mike Penning , former work and pensions minister , admitted that the bill was `` not perfect . ''
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that rapid action was given seven deaths a day .
`` The people are suffering so much and need help now , '' said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma Act in December of last year .
At that point , Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski .
After their first meeting Lazdunski Lang-recommended an operation from which he , unlike Tom Treasure expects a positive effect .
This was from a radiation therapy and chemotherapy followed - a triple therapy , with Lang-Lazdunski a survival rate over five years by up to 40 percent can present .
Abbott felt strengthened .
`` This is , of course , the most important thing , Abbott says .
We see that time and time again in patients .
There is something that you can go on .
If you place , you very quickly .
Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012 .
At the end of August , he was the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy .
After scans showed no sign of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There were several spots around my breast cancer .
I was 50 .
This is not life-threatening .
This is lebensbeendend .
Again Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy .
Now , no trace of the tumours is more visible .
But the process is physically and mentally very tiring .
You need to think about practical things - about money , when I am no longer , for example , or my wife , show how the boiler time setting .
If you receive bad news , you will be negative .
You have to look forward .
As the father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , that is not always easy .
`` It is difficult for parents , '' he says .
It is hard to know what to say and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I said to my girls that I had a disease with which I would not be old .
They reacted very differently .
Tamsin is very sociable and candies .
They told their friends , and it soon , we got a lot of calls .
Ellie was more restrained .
She said not much .
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through .
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not of hope , not a trace of hope of survival .
The disease causes ( such as for Stephen Jay Gould ) , a grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life-threatening .

Leonidas asked in the gladiatorial arena
Not just the gladiators were ankle deep in the mud at the first Rhine Bacher Römertag in the amusement park .
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday , which caused the rain showers and braved the cold autumn and inspired by the historical spectacle .
There was a colorful series of presentations , performances , games , exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland .
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the bellicose fighter force of the gladiatorial school `` Amor Mortis , '' which used a rain break to demonstrate in the arena with soft sand prepared their robust martial art .

`` We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman times to life , '' Lorenz Euskirchen , chairman of the organizers `` friends Romans channel '' explained the intention behind the spectacle .
After two years of preparation time a `` Roman '' oppidum , a Roman city was out of the park for a day , as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage said in his speech .
After all , the Romans brought war and conquest , not only in our region but also the Roman culture and a lot of buildings that we admire today .

The building was probably belongs to a Villa Rustica , an agricultural commodity , the archaeologist Dr Jennifer Morscheiser explained .
A number of findings from these excavations presented them in a glass cabinet , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels , as well as parts of a dainty necklace .
Villa did not exist from the first to the fourth century A.D. , the Roman invasion of the Germanic tribes in Rhineland , Morscheiser suspects .
When her children were also with the Roman windmills game , similar to the current mill game or they wrote as the Roman students their names with Metallgriffeln on wax tablets .
At the booth of the Roman thermal baths , the children were allowed to place Zülpich mosaics , tinker at the booth of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaics and operate at the booth of the Nature Centre Eifel nice homes a serious wheat mill stone around the flour for the flat bread or cereal to grind .

Israeli children are returning after the war in Gaza in their schools back
Thousands of Israeli children from areas in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip returned to the school on Monday , after a summer spent in shelters , while rocket and mortar shelling of their towns during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas went down and schools remained closed in Gaza , while the area recovered by the fighting .
The school brought the start of rocket firing holes no battered communities in southern Israel , a feeling of joy and expectation , but the signs of the battles are still fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod employees `` Pashosh '' -Kindergartens , who was hit by a rocket away , before the arrival of the students shrapnel shards from the walls and glass walls .
`` We have a bit of anxiety , but are excited , '' Ronit beard , someone who lives on in the Kibbutz Saad and the English teacher said .
Many children from our region urgently need a return to a routine .
Their 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt `` a little strange '' to suddenly to go back to school .
`` These were difficult times , and we are not going out of the house , '' she said .
Johns Hopkins President Rivlin visited the caves near the border with Gaza to offer his support .
Until a cease-fire in the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad in their homes or left their homes to move into safer areas further away from Gaza and the rocket and mortar fire .
Many residents of : Oz , a village near the border with Gaza , in which a 4-year-old boy killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade was still hesitate to return .
The Ministry of Education , about a dozen families have still not returned .
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a border town with Gaza , which has drawn heavily from the Palestinian fire .
He urged the children to learn a lot and said `` we will make sure that your knowledge erwerbt and offer you security . ''
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an open-ended `` cease-fire .
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting , but important issues remain unresolved , including Hamas 's demand for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza .
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the handover of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians , three-quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that there are at least half of those killed by militants , but this presented no concrete evidence for information .
On the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker were killed .
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired rockets and mortar shells from 4.591 during the fighting on Israeli towns , most in the south of the country .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
The Israeli attacks that damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people were looking into more than 100 UN schools , which have been converted into temporary shelters .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue the fighting , the education authorities last week postponed the beginning of the school year .
`` I hope that the school will be open again soon , so that we can continue to learn , just like the children in the world and the Jewish children , '' said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy , who is currently in a school in Gaza City .

Feminists criticise race and police behavior in Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson , Mon .
The participants raised their hands high in the air and chanting `` hands up , do n't shoot '' while they waited for the funeral .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo. , over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown the Bloggerin Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
After her experience , white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to reproductive rights and income inequality .
While the tensions , however , rose in the Midwest and throughout the country have received attention , Perez saw the responses of white women focused 100 % on the race .
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots on 9 August , the personal essays with titles like `` thoughts on Ferguson came from a white woman '' and `` feminism is not just about the oppression of women '' relatively late .
But for Perez that meant an important change .
`` I do not think that you will find many people in feminism , '' the white and speak about his privileges in such a high-class type , she said .
People felt forced to say something about the incidents .
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves , and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnisiert so that they have to express that .
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University , Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day , but which are not considered `` women 's issues '' in the cultural space .
`` I can make something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and I get '' 150 Likes from anywhere , `` Mitchell said .
If I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country , the silence is deafening .
`` How can it be safe for women to talk openly about a relationship , but not about safety in the public space ? '' She asked .
For black women , like Mitchell , race , gender and sexuality studies in the history of the United States , there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues .
For them , black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues of clean ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the mainstream feminist circles , Angela Hattery , professor of women and gender studies at the George Mason University says that its predecessors did the opposite .
`` Between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the explanatory statement was almost always '' the rape of a white woman , Hattery said .
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the murder of Lynch .
For Hattery was the split between white and black women to the point where white fighters for women 's suffrage , such as Susan B. Anthony for the country in the late years of the 19th century , analyzed and stated that the battle could be the right to vote only for one group : Women or blacks .
`` They made the decision to fight for women 's suffrage and the right to vote '' for blacks should come later , Hattery said .
When one remembers such things , one with power , why not trust white women , colored women .
We have not done our job well .
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade until white women against Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organized themselves .
The group was established almost 40 years after the initial request for assistance from black women , Mitchell says .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior , racial discrimination - a mirror of the age in which white feminists `` trapping '' played with the problems facing black women is set apart for generations .
`` Would it not be great if the activists , who include such traditional feminist platforms do a child 's right to education as seriously as they do with the right of conception control Mitchell asked ? . ''
The second generation feminists , who built their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives , are now trying to understand what this means .
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem came two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll , distribution of the Guardian , in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism .
`` I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race that are significantly different in public opinion polls - will make the changes , '' Steinem wrote .
Although Steinem represents a more intersectional feminism , in which race and gender issues , are some of their comments on the racial issue in America , amazed .
Christina Summers , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who stole Feminism ? '' To She The People said that young men are in the United States , especially young colored men , `` far more vulnerable than their sisters '' but Steinems comments about Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism .
There are now hundreds of specialized programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But when the White House is a small program , My Brother 's Keeper , worked to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men recently , there were irritating reactions from many feminists including Gloria Steinem .
The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of mainstream feminism .
After the U.S. border police nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-western border of the country has taken up this year , the issue of immigration reform to the surface again - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , co-chairwoman of We Belong Together , an organization that mobilized women for immigration reform , said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an important women 's issue , they only publish the stories of immigrant women .
`` They speak for themselves , '' Mercado said .
If the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants , women who accompany them , are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories will find a reverberation in the women 's organisations , '' she said .

Should Thomas Studanski have slept well last night .
For the first time in his life , the head of the Oberurseler brewery came yesterday with the wheel on the Feldberg .
For the good cause .
The small muscle soreness , he can easily wegstecken there , given that the participation in the 8th chimneys have brought him to the Great Feldberg in favour of the association `` help for children with cancer '' ( Frankfurt ) personally a valuable insight .
A great thing .

Small a quick break on the way in the applause curve ?
Nah , if I had even stopped from warming , `` be ...
As Thomas Studanski for the CDU city parliament sits in many of the 718 participants Oberurseler tortured , yesterday in the mountains and near Frühtau came to the exhaustion , but happy on the plateau .
Others , however , it became easier to overcome the best eleven kilometres long route between high mark and Feldberg .
For example , Norman Dießner .
The whole red or Green politician from the local authority - red dress , red bike - did something at the start of understatement ( `` Any amount of professionals , because the goal is arriving ! `` ) , but then turned on the mountain but as a semi-professional and went after 45 minutes without breathing .
It is also through the route in one go , like Nina Kuhn , press spokeswoman for the town of Oberursel , together with Frank green iron .
For the two triathletes was the `` Feldberg-cycling '' is not necessarily a sporting challenge : `` This is about charity , because we are happy with it - an exit anyway , we would have done today , '' said Kuhn .
Along the way , they had taken Paul Wenzel from Upper tyres .
The boy ( 12 ) was down dangers on the morning after Oberursel to go soon to the height .
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swung in the morning at 9 o'clock at home in the saddle , `` '' made the Feldberg two times to roll home with fun then .

For the head of the Oberurseler cult kiosks are cycling on the Feldberg .
He was with his 6.5-kilogram-racing 40 minutes setting .
A crazy event .
For this purpose , I am happy `` , Andreas Balzke said .
The muscular Mainzer says that he is an `` ambitious racing cyclists . ''
That must be it , because he was with the `` Fixie '' bikes , which are also racing bikes , but without the circuit ...
It was that even without a wheel loose upwards , not just the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fox dancing up to the summit , but also a Jogger , herzog on a cord of a car tyre with weights behind him showed .
Mountain Rescue-doctor Professor Volker Lischke , who , with his team , equipped with all-wheel-drive Bully and Quad , for security , said : `` '' I kenn from Frankfurt , who trains for a special sled trail , only that he prefers the sleigh containing himself . `` The man is , in a sense , his own sled dog .
The 718 participants - and hence so many were like never before - have been sent in groups in the morning on the track .
First the hikers at 9.30 a.m .
It followed the first cyclists and runners at 10 o'clock .
Five minutes later , the first mountain bikers off .
Bent Hansen , Chairman of the Association `` cycling on the Great Feldberg '' gave the starting squads and wished the participants a beautiful trip .
For next year , he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to the field up to the safety of the participants .

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed that information was reported on Monday morning : The online retailer - and video producer , and a multitude of other things - buys the video streaming service for $ 1.04 billion Twitch ( US $ 970 million ) .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch , but because it was widely assumed that the company would buy YouTube .
Three months ago , it looked as if the sale of Twitch on Google 's video service is determined for a cool billion , and cooperation , of course , also appeared .
Twitch , which only three years ago as Justin.tv , was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it was rapidly becoming a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games , a `` YouTube for live games , '' says an insider .
The Twitch interface .
And `` let 's play , '' a genre in which the ( mainly ) older-better games give a veneer of science , are already very popular on YouTube .
It is simply the case that YouTube is often referred to , if you want to describe Twitch , included the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch , a bit bored , a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor .
It is a mystery why the deal did not materialise with YouTube , since the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon .
Everything we know about it at the moment , this statement by Emmet Shear , president of Twitch : `` We opted for Amazon , because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us to go faster . ''
Another secret is , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
For snobs like me who declare that they would rather drive than watching sport , it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others playing rather than even the control console .
It is one thing to see a friend at 3 a.m. on the shoulder while she sneaks through Resident Evil , and quite another to watch a nutcase , he was shot 20 times in a row in Call of Duty in the head .
All of these games you could see now .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games , can watch without their own control over the prospect of facing a really good recipe for headaches .
I admit that the fast runs , the Roger Bannisters undergo in our electronic age whole games in record time , entertaining .
But unless a game or humour virtuoso , is his Twitch-channel probably not so very interesting .
But what sceptics like me already know about ?
Twitch called from 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic .
And how exactly Amazon wants to make money from it ?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video , YouTube Twitch can easily swallow .
But has Twitch something any company would like : Thousands of young men , who are being courted by advertisers .
As the chairman of Twitch , Shear said , Amazon and Twitch `` both believe in the future of gaming '' and the media shows no signs of contraction , or even - Schluck - as a spectator sport .

When I received a reply , I was shocked and terribly ran in panic .
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair , with 18 and 25 , and in the meantime would slowly lose all my skills .
I did it all alone with me and planned my own funeral .

German Chancellor Angela Merkel after sustained resistance from her CDU makes a word for the introduction of a car toll .

Why `` Guardians of the Galaxy '' was a blockbuster
`` The Expendables 3 '' by Sylvester Stallone played a less than 30 million dollars of his $ 90 million budget in the United States , while `` Sin City : A Dame to Kill For '' recorded only 12 million dollars in its budget of 70 million dollars .
Cameron Diaz in the movie `` Sex Tape '' tailored , played on an opening weekend just 14.6 million dollars , children 's films such as `` Dragon 2 '' made slightly tame while also disappointed on revenue .
An article by the Telegraph 's film critic Robbie Collin indicates that the children 's films , the lack of quality in the films themselves may be the reason .
Collin described 2014 as `` the worst year '' for children 's films so far and described `` Dragon 2 '' tame easily made as purely `` functional '' fantasy sequel .
In movies there for a slightly older audience , however , it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Meta Critic rating for every summer movie release , between the American Memorial Day and July 20 , 2013 , and in the current year to at least 2,000 screens .
The results are based on the opinions of film-goers and film critics and indicate that this year 's movie hits are equivalent to those of last year .
Some commentators argue that the trend to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services such as Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently appearing in Disney 's Jungle Book film soon , works on the website Hollywood Reporter , said : `` I think the times are changing . ''
We have to accept that and not try to chase after the past .
In contrast to the currently weak box-office results of the Hollywood productions recently reached Netflix Streaming content with sales of $ 1.2 billion , almost twice as much as last year , in which the turnover stood at 837 million dollars .
Last summer , the director Steven Spielberg criticized the movie studios that they concentrated too much on series of comics and predicted a `` meltdown '' of Hollywood .
Seen in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could well contain a true core .
In the summer of 2015 , due to the expected potential blockbuster , including disorder : Age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World , other representatives of the film industry , however , are more optimistic .
The producer of X-Men , Simon Kinberg , described the decline in box office results recently simply as `` cyclical '' and told the Hollywood Reporter : `` The next summer will be the biggest summer ever at the cinema box office , and no one will worry more about the business . ''

Under this view Ruh prevails
A powerful tribe we showed in our puzzle task of the summer series `` My piece from the Rhöner happiness '' last Friday .
Several of these giant trees still exist in the county , the specimen is `` Geißruheiche '' above under white .
A bumpy one footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak tree .
It is past fields , basalt outcroppings and basalt stone seas .
A bit below the quarry from Bauer , a mile north of the road to Weisbach , as it stands .
Vital is the natural monument , it extends over the other trees in the area and remembers with a circumference of more than eight meters to an American sequoia .
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that there is a spiritual or mystical place .
But despite intensive research , there were only hints of the name of origin .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider asked the extra Bischofsheimer archive consulted and elderly people from among white , to learn what it did with the Geißruheiche Bewandtnis .
The result of his research was the rather sober explanation for the name .
So the goat herders are up about 80 years ago drove their animals under white straight from the laboriously cleared of stones and liberated meadows .
At the foot of the tree , the exhausted animal keepers from the rise should have rested .
In the meantime , the area has won back its significance , because goats graze in the meadows , in fact .
The area has also been declared to the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve , Schneider has found .
Upon entering the stone collections , one should be careful , however , because the sun heated basalt for Cross otters is a popular haunt .
A hiking trail leads from under white straight to the tree , which is somewhat hidden .
Other routes are signposted to climb the high mountains and invite to a long hike .
Where is the water castle ?
A water castle , looking at our next task , however , is to be found in the amount .
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historic buildings in the county , which could fit the building face .
Where is our `` piece from the Rhöner happiness '' ?

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos under water , there is a range of devices .
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-Cam as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both for about $ 300 .
I took these photos in a family party with several cameras , all of which are available at a price of less than $ 350 .
Regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
Check your equipment twice .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure the battery compartment and other subjects are tightly closed .
Put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to include .
Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording modes by which the exposure time is optimized for dämmrigen underwater conditions .
And before you jump into it , you check your equipment is operational in the depth .
Some cameras are permitted only for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
Search in our shopping guides and reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
Make multiple shots - because many of them will not work .
Point-and-shoot cameras are equipped with an LCD , with which you can compose images , not usually action-cams .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see under water , and the right image is a matter of luck .
So you are making a lot of shots .
If your camera has a series mode , with a series of shots with different exposure settings are made , you use it .
Stay close to the surface .
The light is dramatically worse , the further you move away from the surface .
If possible , you remain close to the surface , if you make shots in a pool , a lake or the sea .
As a result , you can also get more colour into your photos ; the deeper you go , the less you 'll see color .
Go to the objects .
This is also a good advice on land , but underwater , it is even more important because of the poor lighting conditions .
It is particularly important when you work with an action-cam : These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens , which means that you have to get closer to their homes , if they are to complete the whole picture frame .

Perry of Texas says that derogatory tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas , Rick Perry , on Sunday included a disparaging remark about Democratic county prosecutor , which is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for misuse of authority .
The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another of Perry 's account of the previous abstritt .
Just a tweet was sent from my account , which was not authorised by me .
`` I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted '' for him , it was said in the message .
Employees of Perry did not immediately responded to requests for comment .
Although the tweets of Perry 's official account , it was not clear who actually uses the feed .
In an earlier tweet an unfavourable image of the district prosecutor of Travis County , Rosemary Clay , who was sentenced in April 2013 due to drink-driving .
Perry vetoed the funding of her office when she refused to step down , which could result in a charge against Perry - the potential 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin .
The text of the tweets reads : `` I 'm not always drunk with the triple allowable alcohol ... but when I do I accuse , Governor Perry , if he ausplaudert it . ''
I am the betrunkenste Democrat in Texas .
Clay 's office was not entrusted with the leadership of the investigation of the grand jury against Perry .
This was led by Michael McCrum , the special prosecutor from San Antonio , who was selected by a Republican judge .
Perry pleads not guilty to and called the indictment a political ploy .
Its outstanding team of legal assistance requested by the judge entrusted with the case , rejecting the charges and argued that the law , which for the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas , is vague in its wording .
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million in state funds to the state 's Public Integrity Unit , which is based in Travis County and in cases of public corruption in Texas - identified as a clay hill refused to resign .
This veto of a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group .
Perry 's official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous .
After the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy had finished in fifth place in 2012 , Perry referred to speculation that he will stop when he posted a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake , with the words `` South Carolina , we are coming ! ''

Berkeley says housing market for `` normal ''
One of the most prominent developers of London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England has returned back to normal levels. ``
Homes in the capital , hotly sought-after and subject to huge price increases , which prompted the Bank of England because of the widespread fear of a credit bubble were intended to put limits on mortgage loans in June .
Tony Pidgley , founder and CEO of first-class investment company Berkeley on Monday , said : `` Since the beginning of the current financial year , the market is back to normal levels of transaction since the 2013 peak back '' and added that it offers a `` stable operating environment . ''
The housing market in London was well established during the downturn , as foreign buyers piled into the capital .
According to information from the cadastral office prices in the city have increased in the past year alone by 18.5 percent , far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole .
The average selling price for private Berkeleys , cheap and student services rose by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April to £423.000 .
However , a stronger pound has made in recent months in London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible `` tax '' before the general election next May .
The London estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report presented in April , where stricter lending rules would also in the second half of the year to lower market growth in both property sales and prices .
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July , which also points out that the real estate market cools .
Hamptions International , another real estate agency , revised its forecast for the increase in property prices in London for 2015 , down to 3 percent , on the basis of an already-weakening house price consciousness .
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London , such as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington , meanwhile fell by a quarter year on year , the real estate agent WA Ellis .
However , the desire for a home in the capital city of Berkeley is a blessing , since the sums due to forward sales amounting to more than £2.2 billion .
Mr Pidgley added : `` The demand for a proper , well-planned product remained stable in the best locations and as a result the futures sales have remained stable . ''
In June , the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007 .
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent annually to £280 million , sales by 18 % to £1.6 billion .
On Monday , in a statement before the annual meeting of the company Mr Pidgley said that revenues in the current year for Berkeley would be expected to match the current market expectations .
Many of the analysts estimate the annual pre-tax earnings to £450 million .
Berkeley shares were trading in the afternoon at the London firm at £23,96 .

Lenny Henry : My father never took me by the arm .
Has never said `` I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family jamaikanischer immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father , who died when Henry , 19 , worked in a factory , and their relationship was limited .
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy that 's Rudy 's Rare Records , which is based partly on an imaginary conversation with his father , and from the series on Radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
He visited `` many '' therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
It was hard to know him .
We never saw his face , hear his voice : `` Hearing on the crash .
Keep your sister in peace .
Beweg you !
I want to watch cricket .
My older brothers , Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child , went to the pub with him and talked about things such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of cricket .
I never had such a conversation with him .
A large part of my life , he was a serious guy in the corner , reading the newspaper .
Recently , Henry opened a foundry in Dudley , and even though the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he won , but an insight into how life may have been for him .
It is a little brighter now , but they are dark , quite smoky , deep stygische maze with flames and smoke and a lot of soot .
My father was always in the tub and then you could hear him slowly , as he began to sing , because he was able to wash the foundry .
When I went there , it was clear to me that he had done this for many years to get the food on the table , and my respect for him has been greater .
However , Henry grew up as a child without his parents `` love .
My father never hugged me , he never said `` I love you . ''
Only when it came to my mother at the end of her life , we started badly , `` I love you , I love you , I love you '' to say .
By his own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , he could share the love that he had missed as a child .
But with the `` I love you '' stop ?
But on hearing to embrace me !
Papa , I 'm 22 !
With Dawn French .
Why should we not be friends ?
She is a great mother .
It is still a French friend , with whom he had been married for 25 years .
Dawn is a good man .
Why should we not be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henry 's own mother was diabetic .
That contributed to her death .
So when I became very , very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said , `` You need to be radical .
So I got this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is tiring .
No one likes to eat carrots .
Henry 's career change is reflected in his elegant , short-trimmed beard .
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello , he is captured by the theatre .
It 's the comedy of errors , and then fences by August Wilson .
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy work life .
He started with only 16 years ago , when he worked in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on stage when he wrote to imitierte and New Faces on him .
His television career began in the mid-1970s . `` I was for a very long time , the only black impersonator/comedian on TV . ''
He learned in the profession .
I was not only in the eyes of the public at large , but also learn from 1975 to 1985 , as I tell jokes and an efficient machine , while I was a television star , and that was really difficult .
Lenny New Faces in 1975 ,
As his manager , the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show , had a light entertainment program in which people `` '' anmalten Black , Henry on his comedy about five years .
In my family it was very unpleasant .
Somehow , I wish that it had never happened , but I do not regret that I did it .
It was a strange , awkward position for me , but I worked on big projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But this `` years of award-winning light pillar of British television '' was also a `` grotesque parody of black people . ''
The introduction of characters that the British black culture both celebrated and scorned , , Henry worked in the 1980s for an alternative comedy circuit .
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984 , and in the 1990s , he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Black Lock in the comedy series boss ! .
Commercials , documentaries , TV series and film roles were his next decade , but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought : `` What are you doing next , Len because everything feels when you 're just about the time or play a little on the spot . ''
Then , a documentary series for Radio 4 , entitled What 's So Great About ... ?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare .
On Shakespeare , I was allergic .
I had never really learned in school about it , and it kept him mostly for the domain of the middle class , whites in tights and a cabbage .
So I had a great fear .
All those we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said `` you should try it .
It was not a bad thing , if you do not know what are you talking about .
Nimm a few of the words in his mouth , and then you 'll understand why we all love Shakespeare .
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary , and he was thrilled .
I had the feeling that I could do it .
It was almost as if someone had my head finally right .
`` That is the issue , it is a serious thing , take it seriously , learning your text recherchiere a bit .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we made it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car accident , and this simply not happened .
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors .
Suddenly , I was at the National Theatre , and I could hardly believe it .
There was a moment when I thought , `` Oh , you 've changed you . '' ``
There was a technical error , and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience .
`` A little voice said to me '' you must now bridge 10 minutes while they repair the computer. `` ''
Instead , the stage director , announced that the show would go on , once the problem is resolved .
I went from the stage and something in me said , `` Oh , thank God . ''
I am not responsible for this .
I can leave it to someone else .
`` You play in a play , i.e . blowing in your role . ''
Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text for fences was demanding .
Panic is very good , which strengthens the tendons .
That was good , so it 's like a big sign of the gods who tell me `` This is your purpose here . '' ``
He says that , of course , with a thundering voice .
So I stay here .
I really love it .
I love to be in a rehearsal room .
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation of humorous outbursts , while he imitates people again .
I have decided to stand-up comedy , because I think that this kind of instant gratification in a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
If you are looking for that constantly , so you go in front of a wall .
I am sometimes live at the Apollo when I have fun , but overall , there is not as much as before .
I ask him if he ever returned to a stand-up comedy tour .
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps a beginning to form a middle section and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever lose again .
So this is his new incarnation here ?
I think .
I am quite an actor .
It 's fun .
It always tells a story , and that is great .
I love stories .
People love stories .

Manufacturing in the eurozone at a 13-month-low
The increase in production in the euro zone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months , a closely watched survey .
The final Markit purchasing managers index ( PMI ) for the manufacturing sector fell to 50,7 in August , after a stand of 51.8 in July .
A number above 50 indicates an expansion .
New orders fell and factory experienced declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday .
The markets expect the bank a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
There is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could make further information during the course of this week , if he pulls a quantitative easing in the eurozone , according to those who were from Britain and the United States during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth , the deterrent effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for the manufacturers , '' Rob Dobson , senior economist at Markit , said .
The factory-PMI for Germany , the largest trading partner of Russia within the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
In the meantime , the bloc and France , the PMI fell to the second-largest economy on 46,9 .
France remains a concern , as well as the descent of Italy by a solid expansion to stagnation .
Evidence that growth incentives in key industrial mechanism , Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer are not reassuring , `` said Mr Dobson .
The decline of the industry probably feeds the fire of the analysts , who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
The positive news came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI rose to 57.3 , its highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economist at IHS Global Insight , said : `` The best that can be said for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro zone in August , is that the sector will continue to grow after that . ''
He added : `` In the euro area producers will find life very difficult at the moment , obviously , since the current heightened geopolitical tensions increase - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - uncertainty over the continuing difficult conditions in many countries .
This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and will probably mean that some jobs will be delayed or even cancelled , particularly large-scale orders .
He said that it was `` increasingly likely '' that the ECB will eventually have to take a kind of QE , `` although we suspect that this will be limited . ''
