Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are dealt with by law , so that the procedure for the reorganization of the work days around the holidays has now been established , but the coming year little such days .
Also in the EU and in America one means something different by `` holiday '' .
The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days .
Work free days are usually ecclesiastical holidays or are related with significant historical events .
We celebrate for example also new year : both the last day of the old , as also the first day of the new year , free days - for the latter to rest .
Throughout the year , we have a total of fourteen holidays .
The state of 15 March are at the revolution of 1848 , and 23 October , the anniversary of the revolution of 1956 .
On 20 August the establishment of state , on 1 May the work celebrated on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead .
In addition there are the two holidays to Easter , Pentecost and Christmas .
As our Heads of State or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall , the practice of the `` '' proved itself in the cases in which we before or after the holiday only a day would work .
The price of the prolonged weekends , however , is that we are very probably work on Saturdays before it , or must go to school .
When that day before or after the holiday should be processed last finally , since long years by the Employment Minister in its own regulation .
The legislation applies to all employers and takers for public employees and civil servants of the public service .
Only companies and facilities are excluded , in which the company without interruption , also at the holidays , is continued .
This only rules by holidays at the end of the year are damaged : from the 24th December remains life positively in this country as most of the days between Christmas and New Year 's Eve , or the holidays , particularly for it waived .
Next year more holidays fall into the , and at the end of the week at the working days , so that there will be less than this year .
First the calendar is around the day of the work on the head `` , so that the people of four days now at can stay at home .
Saturday , the 26 April will be a working day , thereby Friday , 2 May can be a day of rest .
The second change of plans is connected with the holiday on 23 October , on Saturday , the 18 October will be process Friday , 24 October first .
The end of the year will however be in the indication of the holidays , after all , from the 24th December and , if New Year 's Eve , even on a Wednesday .

Nevertheless , the dream is not for all time , said .
The Hamburg Sport Federation ( hsb ) regretted statements of beusts .
Thus the impression that Hall in the next 25 years , no longer want to apply for Olympic Games .
It is too early to obstruct a chance for himself , by encouraging the plans already at this time buried , said Günter ploß on Wednesday .
A renunciation of the application is furthermore contrary to the statement of the one on to the General Assembly of the German .
There the application of the 2015 `` not as a substitute for Olympic Games in Hamburg .
The College was only in the last week as applicant City Hall nominated .
The SPD citizens faction reproached the Senate valuable time for the House building in Hamburg to have used .

As for the SPD was always an integrated planning for Olympia and a subsequent use , the CDU on one side on the `` factor '' .

Climate propaganda
Since the both the sceptics of the climate change and those that put a social and political debate in the face of a merciless criticism , the unterzieht movement as a whole a strong cohesion on the day .
Especially when it is a question of a chief of the movement , which , as in the case of the government Zapatero , the fight against climate change is more important than the fight of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests a new contract with the planet to a conclusion .
This proposal brings it , however , in a declaration concerning the action , or of his government which has contributed decisively to that Spain within the EU at the top of the countries is that the guidelines of the least fulfilled .
Who are the persons responsible for the non-fulfilment of handicaps , to which sectors is this , and his government that the contract with the planet had proposed not stop this development .
In addition it is now forced , the Spanish citizens of which measures against him to explain the climate change without beating around .
Which companies will be affected by the citizens , which is supposed to be changed , which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and what economic consequences result from that .
More specifically , the victims , and who must pay for saving the planet .
However , it has and there will be no such explanations in the future .
Just because it is a question of the sacrificing and the payment is concerned .
Because the measures against climate change , which can really be used are unpopular .
They are uncomfortable and alarming for the accounts of companies and citizens .
Even the proposed by the PSOE appeared seen Zapatero so dangerous that he saw forced to take back the proposal again .
Accordingly , now , the planet with nothing , with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences .
With impressive statements , commissions , committees , protocols and new offices .
With his contracts with the planet , the otherwise so suitable for campaigns politicians talk neither , still accuse , still want instead follow the exacting output and decorate meetings with his this kindness to inspire and others .
But this can only be done if the Treaty does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and thus does not claim that the bicycle future to the only progressive movement or we will only with a fan may .

Everything still open
Memo romey said , it does not consider worthy of a presidential candidate from a to be consulted .
Nevertheless , the Republican candidate for the Presidency , ultimately , willing to place itself to a debate on the questions , in ordinary voters video questions and hand in order to send it to the candidate .
None of the questions that on the Wednesday evening , the 28 November , were raised , as ridiculous as the snowman the democrats , about the global warming in the debate of the other party .
But the questions , and the answers , reflected this time is the state of the Republican Party which opens in the elections next year is open .
It is not known , just as the producers of CNN , the debate , the selected the candidates to selected the beginning .
Yet in the first half hour of debate , the longest the a single issue was dedicated , immigration stood in the heart .
The issue is one of the strongest topics for Republicans .
The CNN asked to manipulate a group of voters to operate a if they heard things that they liked : the television noticed points of the agreement as the candidates talked about the borders severely .
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between rudy Giuliani , the national forerunner , and romney of in the decisive inquiries in Hampshire and new pushed forward .
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call that he was soft with regard to illegal immigration , when he was mayor of New York .
He attacked romney in that it the former governor of Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for working on its House .
The two stopped especially hard as interrogators asked whether one of the candidates a `` Amnesty '' ( illegal a regular status and the way to the citizen would be ) would support .
More insignificant candidates as Duncan hunter , a representative , and Tom tancredo , a representative from Colorado , in with this topic .
Neither of the two men have serious chance during the nomination , but both stay in the running , maybe because sooner and harder than others on the immigration bass drum .
At least in the field of immigration , the candidates and the same opinions : sharper borders , intolerance illegal migrants .
This issue , together with fears about poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world to help the republicans differences between the liberal Conservatives and Christian or to minimize the least .
But the debate was clearly problematic as other topics for the language .
Mr Giuliani was asked , why he supported in the past .
John McCain and romney discussed about whether drowning should be regarded as torture .
One of the interrogators asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible .
This Giuliani representing the point of view that although the Bible is his preferred book , it the history of jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale .
A further question regulator asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
MIKE huckabee - now towards all expectations in the first place in an inquiry recently carried out in thanks to his Christian conservatism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty is painful , but necessary .
When he was pushed on whether Jesus would approve it , he said about Jesus was too intelligent in order to apply for a political office .
The racing remains open extraordinarily .
Huckabees rise in comes together with Paul 's recent and its in the debate of Wednesday .
These two are out of nothing , because the two wings of the party up to now not yet on one of the better known and more traditional candidates of some could .
In 1980 and 2000 a candidate from the beginning and convincing together with a victorious message about the size of America and a to both wing of the party .

Venus is the twin of earth
The Venus , despite their anti-life atmosphere of the earth of similar than up to now thought : the European space probe `` Venus express '' has flashes in the atmosphere and discovers in Poland , as they arise in the winter also on earth .
Since almost three decades of scientists suggest that there is on the Venus .
Now the European probe `` Venus express '' produced the proof - it sought out electromagnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere : the flashes on the Venus fire at a value of approximately 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud Christopher , reports from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine `` nature '' .
According to the famous `` ursuppen-theorie '' flashes life on earth develop : thunderstorms should have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the formation of amino acids , the elements of life .

Today , it is on the surface of the Venus little live : the atmosphere is about a hundred times more closely than on earth , there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees .
`` The Venus is perhaps the of the earth , but it is a twin '' , said russel .
Why the Venus , the earth in mass and size so similar , such a completely different development , is the basic question .
The start of `` Venus express '' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research as , since the beginning of the nineties no probe more particularly for the study of this planet was under way .
The most recent research results now in several `` nature '' are presented to underline in the view of the researchers , not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system .
`` You also show that in parallel with the earth is larger than initially accepted '' the ESA informs .
For example , next to the already known whirlwind researchers at the North Pole also at a , it is still far more quickly .
The phenomenon reminds air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere to a group piccioni of the Italian Istituto Giuseppe Di astrofisica spaziale e hemisphere .
The second innermost planet of the solar system is almost the same as the earth is excessive and with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers almost as large .
Also as a or the planet referred circles in scarcely 225 days around the sun .
But he concerns a lot slowly themselves : a will take 243 earth .
Although the Venus with of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar scarcely on the earth scientists assume that both planet had arisen under very similar conditions .

What insurance is suitable for me the best ?
The insurance that a possible claim caused by the driver , covers contains a high cost whose height of depends on different factors , and other of age , sex , time of the creation of the driver 's type of car which can be insured and its use , and so forth .
To own a car is only the beginning .
After all , it is even more difficult to find the suitable insurance as the correct vehicle model .
First , it must be clear to one with what we have to do it here .
A car insurance is an agreement between an assurance company and an insured .
This agreement will be held in writing by means of an versicherungsvertrags damage that society receives and return to a claim is that the appropriate sum paid in compensation .
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance , consists through several factors , and other age , sex , time of the creation of the driver 's type of vehicle which can be insured or its use .
The insurance companies and set their prices according to the statistics so that with a higher danger of accident also higher payments are due .
For this reason both via women less contribution payments achieve , because statistics prove that these groups , thanks to their caution have a smaller accident rate .
The same is true for married persons , as this according to statement of the statistical values and therefore also after conviction of the enterprises to fewer accidents tend as singles .
The benefits , is attributed to the vehicle influences the frequency of the driving and thus also the probability of an accident .
As the use , the more probably the damage .
At the installation of the premium insurance must consider a whole series of points .
For this reason also the driver must study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance which meet its personal needs earliest .
We do this is the most important points that one with the selection of an insurance should take into account not only to performance , but also a price oriented choice to make .
The less than 25-year meetings with the choice of a low-priced insurance in numerous obstacles , such as low and the `` young '' driving licence .
Even if it is an ideal coverage for the risks to a conclusion , there are nevertheless more inexpensive alternatives .
The cautious drivers can select a full hull with , so that the achievements of an covered , but indeed offered at a low price .
This kind of contract contains that the customer a part of the amount resulted from the damage must pay .
The amount is before the end of the contract and by means of the levels of a higher premium is ever smaller the sum to be Luis Noguera explains main agent of Spain with , one for Europe .
Another option is not the enlarged insurance , the customer against external damages , however , against the harm arisen at the own car .
Furthermore , this kind of the insurance theft , fire and vehicle loss .
A Council .
If you are less than 25 years old , it suits in your hand to lower the cost of insurance ; so your credit increases itself when trying to drive , and to avoid accidents .
A credit is a lowering of the base rate in the corresponding assurance company .
For this purpose a payment on an increase of said rate .
The height of credits and punishment payments are linked to society and its returns .
If it has a rich year behind it , can be taken the liberty , to increase explains .
As soon as the exceeded , it is easier for drivers to sign a contract . Reason for this is the fact that with increasing the accident rate sinks .
Thus it is most reasonable for deciding with a full deduction .
Usually the young people can not profit from their previous experience no , both in the case of an accident and at the time of driving not , describe the Spanish of the European enterprise , and adds , that the majority of the accidents in the second , after the fear of beginner `` was put down .
Nevertheless it is with a married customer , who does not possess children , a full ; only then does , of course , if the financial situation of the person concerned also approves .
On the part of married couples with children are regarded as the customers with the least accident rate , and correspondingly low also their contribution payments .
In this case , would be a full comprehensive insurance with ( with an amount for the 300 Euros ) the best option which you will receive a high credit , is recommended an extended insurance , only for the third year .
You go more loosely in total and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to a higher contribution payment determine Luis Noguera .
It is good for pensioners , with a full deduction ( with an amount around 150 ) , the euro or an enlarged insurance which does only with a sufficiently high credit .
Finally one must observe that the car insurance something very important not only because it protects the driver against possible , but also because it contains high costs require it , that a thorough choice is made , which corresponds to our personal situation .

Small Saarland , good education
The smallest state is leading with the job training and shine even with the international orientation of its nature .
Only in an education which expresses the same deficit as the rest of the country .
`` I have 'yesterday to the 50th time , that we are not French - the smallest state placards this slogan ironically to its 50th birthday .
In this case France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland the of the Institute of the German economy Cologne ( iw ) on place five .
So the colleges co-operate already from tradition countries closely .
The university in Saarbrücken was set up in 1948 of the French .
Until now , lock here their study with a double or even close .
The part is correspondingly high foreign studying with 15.6 per cent .
But also the Saarland brings the onto the colleges in number above average - many of them without an end at grammar school .
`` in Saarland one uses the professional education '' expert , says at the iw .
More than every fifth young person acquires its study authorization at a vocational school , this increase is more than seven percentage points over the .
Even the possibilities of vocational and academic training are comparatively fully developed .
On the total population the equipment with dual courses of studies which is based in Germany .
In spite of the practical training and increasing demand the number of the engineer in recent years , however , around a third have declined .
For that the ministry engaged the universities now to a marketing campaign for fan .
`` at the general education schools after the Pisa study we first activated a few reforms says '' , a speaker of the Ministry of Education .
So the Government introduced national benchmark tests .
In this way the children to begin formerly to learn is the last kita year free of charge , a model that meanwhile also other Federal States copy .
If the services of the pupils improve development will show , only future comparative studies .
In PISA 2003 the part of the risk of 29 to 20 % .
Altogether the Saarland did not however increase as strongly as other States .
The Bavarians calculate better .
And the anger at the are not measured - in this area , one could otherwise .
Because the language of the neighbours is at grammar schools - even if the French are not .

Political capital : Hungarian guard increases state risk
In the view of the Department of risk analysis ( risk division ) of political capital in the activities of this August with support from the `` movement for a better Hungary '' Hungarian created guard the risk of Hungary and the region in several respect .
In the `` risk '' of the institute does among other things : in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk sets the `` intensification of already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and in Hungary , even in the short term , which could lead to violent ethnic quarrels . ''
The main reason is the Hungarian guard , probably at the provocation of such a confrontation , for example at the research institute .
How reports , this is a failure on the part of the politically responsible considered : `` public discussion of have with representatives of radical political grouping , who are now based their political strategy on the '' .
One presumes that the problem , the reasonable dialogue impossible extremities favour , as well as the probability of violent quarrels would increase .
The forschungsinsitut means the activities of the Hungarian guard , not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media , `` the picture of Hungary abroad substantially , particularly in confidence in the stability and democratic maturity is concerned . ''
We remember : since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary is accelerating , so that since summer 2007 several association , `` national '' naming organizations were established .
`` these groups is that in each case define as a civil organization , while they are boasting about that openly their members on - sometimes armed - tasks , preparing ( disaster protection , national Defense ) , with reference to the unsuitability of the police , the army or the State itself , '' called it .
Further , and this in accordance with that method which is focused on the political and various moroseness of the population based , political efforts as civil initiative to camouflage .
The emphasis on civilian character and the association not merely serve the avoidance of legal hurdles in the course of the registration in court could emerge - it is also a political strategy .
What is to be understood from the analysis , the activities of the Hungarian guard a risk factor for the relations with the States .
In recent months , the Hungarian guard in several States as a potential source of surveys , for politician of certain countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own .
All this has effects on the political stability of the region - it was called `` .
From the point of view of the research institute the creation of the Hungarian guard no in , thus the political risk increased for the entire region .
As reports , the activities of the Hungarian guard comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard , in the creation of the Bulgarian 's National Union ( bnu ) was announced .
In the background of the Bulgarian guard were in a mass of Sofia quarters ( krasna poljana ) stood .
The bnu took as an opportunity the incidents for the establishment of the national guard , with the argument that the objective of the organization of the `` national protection '' .
In their view , is the last 17 years a regular `` palpable '' in Bulgaria , the State remained , however , idle and indifferent - so political capital .
And further : the initiative would have a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public kicked loose .
As said that the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard .
There the activities of the Hungarian guard up to now many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows , not to exclude it is that the Hungarian Roma also with the organization of their own protection to react to the threats that it is called in the risk of political capital .

In many places saving
This year more than a thousand infections in hospitals that due to inappropriate handling antibiotics .
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals , the overcrowding of the beds , the overload of personnel - factors , that the embankment of the infections are not just benign so the leading doctor of the national .
In many cases also near the saving .
In the traumatology-department of the to hospital a mrsa-infection was diagnosed recently .
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient , after a serious accident to the hospital .
The patient was isolated .
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here .
The injured person of a hard car accident was released from the hospital , the man had little later return , however , with a mrsa-infection an important because of the operation , since that is still in the body of patients , not yet carried out .
Until 10 December of this year from hospitals activated by pathogens infections scale to the national nosocomialis surveillance system , so the leading doctor of the national , .
So many activated by scale , pathogens infections were registered in the hospitals therefore with security , may be higher in the darkness .
About two thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) were against by the methicillin-oxacillin of resistant staphylococcus unnecessarily .
The staphylococcus ( SA ) bacterium bears about a third of the people in their nose without its causing an illness .
SA limited infections ( as inflammation of the throat , tonsillitis , inflammations of the skin or wounds ) react mostly well to antibiotics , they are well curable .
The means are however measured out too high or used , arise from the well respondierenden antibiotics resistant bacteria under appropriate conditions spread out in the hospitals quickly .
In the case of patients with badly or permanently immune systems , but also in older , or patients with small body weight can these bacteria difficult infections , such as or wound poisoning , therefore , cause .
The scale of the medical according to hospital is nothing special , such occurrences life .
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic , manhte a - there are not only there , where it is not searched .
Resistant to antibiotics
`` such patients are isolated , the nursing staff bears rubber and masks the supply , and we have the antibiotics , necessary for the treatment of '' - so .
With their admission into the hospital to the patients to be examined , not always an infection can be avoided .
Sampling too rare
The majority of initiated by infections in hospitals would be avoidable , however the currently prevailing conditions and conditions for the checking of stemming the origin or the spread of the virus , says .
After this infection mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly , the taken patients should examine and mrsa-infected immediately isolate .
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not quite so often .
Last but not least because it sides of the national health no subsidies for this investigation .
Most cases would not come to light before then therefore if anybody has a noticeable , according to the medical head of the epidemiology Center .
In addition , the European Union , there are strict recommendations regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine , there is , however , also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures .
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be precise , that is , microbiological studies are necessary , so that no resistance to the means , however , that this directive is not always kept by hospitals either .
Under the or in the basic contained patient microbiological sampling are even more scarce , however .
In the case of the saving will
Scientific evidence proves that to patients with one of the most widely on the other is transmitted by nursing staff .
So the manual washing , or carrying gloves and masks a great importance , however , there are also in this area considerable shortcomings in the hospitals .
To is transmitted through droplet infection or contact in the indigenous hospitals , it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient .
The rooms are even often full the beds connected barely even epidemiological view between them from a distance of at least 1.5 meters should be .
As karolina keep saying , it happens unfortunately in the financially less well set hospitals even that near saved , there are few nurses , many patients - factors , which almost favour the emergence of infections .
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further spread of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are followed , however .
Against to government Program
In handle causes enormous costs for the health insurance , so they are fought everywhere .
In England , for example the prevention of , or to their containment held in the government program .
After the first signs is successful - as published data prove , the tendency of the declining in England .
The European heart for illness prevention ( ECDC ) , the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant ( including ) , as well as to the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities .

Bulgaria , the EU
The development of the Bulgarian property market - all of Europe looks attentively at the Balkans state formerly rarely mentioned .
What , where , and who still have to buy the cheapest market , the EU becomes more expensive wildly ?
An analysis of the Bulgarian re / Max division .
Bulgaria is currently without a doubt the plaster for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe , with most and houses in the sea .
Between the mountains , the regions bansko , borovec , pamprovo and the popular , too , at the sea albena `` , the '' , the `` , '' and the historical and the properties , but rather around kavarna and balcik asked more and more .
According to estimates of re . Or in Bulgaria also the inland sooner or later , to attract investors , for example , gabrovo , Elena , and triavna , and also expressed the area of records more buyers .
The capital Sofia offers also enticing offers - trade and office areas offer highest yields .
Bulgaria is on the best way to one of the most attractive European , and so the next summer and winter season also in the other two seasons attract tourists .
Foresighted investors shop therefore are already in great style , for example around bansko .
According to people in Bulgaria , seek the properties and that a change of their conduct .
Most purchasers British , there are prospects however also come from France , Belgium , Spain , and more and more from Romania .
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present while there are being in the Black Sea and mainly Russian purchasers .
There are three groups of foreign buyers says regional director of re..
Those who want to establish themselves , either to buy properties 50100.000 euro or descended houses by 50-100.000 euro , which they then .
Good connection and accessibility and communication possibilities are largely written , but also the proximity to a city , businesses and doctors are decisive for the buyers .
The second category , who in the search for a domicile ( Bulgaria was in December under the top ten listed for vacation objectives of the Germans ) .
The third group make the businessmen , with the objective of a medium- to long-term increase in value .
In the capital properties are constantly more expensive , necessitated by the ever growing demand .
Within the EU , the lowest indeed in Bulgaria , in the last five years there was a price increase , however , around 21 % annually .
The price increase with the real estate prices far exceeds the increase of salaries .

England confronted with decision on the statements of owais Shah and
Here two dilemmas , each of them almost as difficult as the others .
Who as number 6 for England in kandy at this weekend , owais Shah , or ravi ?
And , not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka , who is supposed to make the decision ?
The second question is important , because the David youthful , on call at least under this specific title , here is the Peter bog and captain Michael Vaughan to help to determine and because the table of high morries , the English gradually managing director , with applications for national voter pews when not even for which in partial time .
Whoever does not get the sixth will be unfortunate , but the life is often unfair and the sport , it is beyond doubt .
It is never easy to nail exactly what a human being to reach the top of his while someone else about the lowest rank sometimes for lack of luck instead of capacity .
It is not only in the cricket where it is needed , where difficult judgments are always at the end subjective .
It is the correct time for , from ?
It is fair to Shah if he does it ?
The same can , in a further area may also be asked whether , for example , John Edward `` or '' , both intelligent young managers with good ends , know the business well should be promoted .
Who can say what the right class for a one-day , unless , he will have the possibility to swim or to go down .
As a matter of course numbers have a great influence on decisions , but also have this chance .
Within a team a one-day must the eye of the captain at the right time , start if he can take a wicket and a regular opportunities must be in order , if he wants to do impression as a one-day .
The eyes of the catch is too complicated .
There were many who better in the last season than , for example , as James Anderson , seemingly in the first test will play , even if Stephen pronounces itself and for known as the wind into the nets .
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with each 33 runs in order to earn a position in this tour .
Chris tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average , but they both had their highlights and hope for even more .
Whether Shah or , in the asgiriya stadium , can only play a question .
The choice could decide on the careers of both men , or , perhaps , but it makes little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka played Gareth batty in every test and was successful in the first , with five wickets and 40 useful runs , it was , however , Paul , then still fightingly , in order to consolidate the break-through to an important testkricketspieler abolished and that , although it is a double hundred against Australia in Australia , perhaps still is underestimated .
It is probable that youthful Vaughan and bog , after a further discussion in the course of today 's in the asgiriya stage their conservative instincts and for shahs greater experience about net enthusiasm will follow .
There are arguments for both of them .
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay , 43 first-class hundreds , and only six of the seven years younger with 22 years , and an excellent balance against bullets .
But Shah made only ten runs in its two innings in the may against West in the test in Lord , its as a player from middlesex , and this , plus his immediate rejection of the devices as Vaughan was known for his position for the next game , the momentum from its defeat seems to have taken the was still manifest in Bombay .
In contrast , the Jack of all trades from Essex Essex .
He has nothing to a impressed and its attitude off of it was perhaps when he recently with a vehicle in an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen had estimated .
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock , but the first thing he did was his Vodafone ( , of course , also gesponsort ) to get out and ask its Cook , which had observed this from the distance , and eagerly to say : `` You saw that did ? `` .
, is a much better , he his here with some impact on the grounds , what it seems to match and tolls with confidence and fate .
The right man to vote is one thing , to choose the correct time another .
Perhaps that is the actual art of choice .
I now its opportunity for this purpose , which does not mean that Shah well , but perhaps not chef if , as the from Ceylon suggests , it is that that will play here this weekend .

Richard is simply not cynical enough
With `` the party '' and `` murderous peace '' two films deal again with Balkan war .
But both do not .
Either the concepts set too much on action and geballer or however they are too sentimental .
There also Richard in `` the hunting party did not help .
The good news first , while the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide still in the mountains of the Balkans , but right there , in the dark hinterland of , now the actors , Richard have found again .
We had the most beautiful man in the last years from the eyes , because in all too many kind unimportant roles for women and all too many press conferences drove Buddhism is the desire to issue a on seeing .
Now , Richard suddenly the most important argument , `` the party - when the hunter to the will gejagten ( why must be today actually always so long and confused as train them , perhaps , but ? ) .
It provides a perfect representation : after his Simon what could have become from , if the fate and the reporter were not so benevolent : a man , of its very best times has long behind it but himself as a monument his decline is preserved considerable residues of the former charm .
But in spite of this , `` the hunting party '' together with the German production `` murderous peace '' starts also in this week , only the endless series of failed continues .
With `` murderous peace '' one can do short process : the film acts of two German soldiers in Kosovo ( Adrian topol , Max riemelt ) , from save from Kosovo , on which a swiftly , her falls in love .
Although it is not that once an only Serbs as the root of all evil are represented , the film is far too quickly in geballer and action .
It remains a kind of `` alarm for 11 '' without motorway but for with war .
On the other hand it can turn to `` the party '' almost exemplary , why it did not was never yet a correctly good Balkans .
The history of three , to open up the Serbian `` the fox to trace with '' would have another director and another ( both in personnel Union Richard shepard ) at another time perhaps a new ‘ Apocalypse Now `` .
Because the stories are alike yes : go both male small teams in the forest , in order to achieve something which the soldiers and not can both male it becomes a journey into the madness .
One of the reasons for the failure of `` the party '' is that it is not simply the Simon descended cynic with heart when he presented to us at the beginning .
No , the script , and it still a romantic affair with a Bosnian murdered later .
Finally `` the hunting party '' go then the brook down , if the reporters within the last five minutes in the CIA succeed in what NATO , and all of the world in five years : the war criminal catch and the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge .
That is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague because of crimes against the wishes to call .
The film has a deeply human concerns .
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still freely , and he suspects the Americans and the French ( here they are supposed to be by way of exception once agreed ) pursuit due to secret political arrangements so intensively .
But the well-meant one and the evil are sometimes so similar to that a famous comes into the sense .
In that it is called on the wooden of Asian demon on the workbench of the poet : `` I see the swollen front forehead : how hard it is to be bad '' .
Films as `` the party '' have exactly such swelling heads , however suggest how hard it is to be good .
The problem is not limited to the category of the limited .
Recent newspaper reports is that all Iraq films were big flops .
One can add : there has never been a good South .
Almost always applies : if a star on the elements or mine fields of the world , then something comes out of it as `` Rangoon '' with Patricia arquette beyond all borders , `` or '' blood diamonds `` with '' with Leonardo dicaprio .
Possibly all the conflicts within a given time simply still too .
It is , after all , decades ought to pass before Hollywood with `` Schindler 's list '' shoot a good film about the Holocaust .
Some film will presumably still mature - as classics now geltenden `` the '' , `` Apocalypse Now '' or `` full metal at that time really '' are not celebrated as masterpieces unanimous .
But maybe we know today , where every mass murder in real time comes on now two screens at home , also simply too much about the conflicts in the world .
And that robs the screenplay writers , which it needs in order to tell good histories .
`` existence or the '' or `` yes '' big dictator are finally therefore as well as well , because lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet how badly the Nazi regime really prevailed .
Perhaps one may not want to be good if one wants to make good films .
Perhaps the artist look of the Lawrence Norfolk .
As the parallels between his historical novel `` lemprières dictionary '' and Balkan war was questioned , he replied : `` that is only because some things never change .
Cities are always terribly dangerous , people will always be murdered in dreadful way and always there will be war in Yugoslavia. ``

Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is in fact an island of freedom .
What they expect from their holidays , that will be fulfilled if they choose the right thing to do .
Golden and white beaches , high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond .
And all of this with palms including at the beach offer pizza , ice and beguiling cocktails .
Kitesurfing , Gulf and roulette .
On the islands of the Caribbean , you find that in measure .
Only on an island you find , however , still many more , and that is the island of Cuba , the largest and most beautiful great Antilles .
At present the Spaniard was Cuba their bastion of conquest America .
It called Columbus the most beautiful place saw each individual human eye .
Havana was once a warehouse or transit camp of value , which had stolen the Spaniards in America and then transported to Europe .
And then the American period .
The hotel Nacional completely arose at the end of the 20th century .
Building left it one of the leaders of the American mafia , Lucky Luciano , because everything that was regarded as a crime in the USA ( especially during the prohibition on Cuba ) , was most welcome and support - drugs , gambling , prostitution .
Under his guests were among other things .
Winston Churchill , ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
In Havana high-rise buildings increased , over the wide boulevards of car go which were part of the cult of the ritual among .
Ernest Hemingway bought a estate in San Francisco de Paula , near and he had in his yacht lie .
At the walls of the bodeguita del Medio star of the show business and politicians from the whole of America their signatures .
And today ?
At the walls of the bodeguita of Havana , you too can leave behind your .
At the bar in the hotel Nacional it mixes cocktails very for it .
And the cult of the 1950s drive around in Havana until today because the imported once and Fiats in the and damp air fell apart a long time ago .
May Havana , in particular his oldest part heavily nowhere does it finds in so many colonial objects of interest here as straight .
Other places are just straight , for example Trinidad .
In relation to that of tourism brings urgently needed money , it was there for this development green light .
In the last fifteen years , not only new hotels in Havana , but also in varadero , at the coast of the province holguín and also on islets as cayo Coco , cayo Guillermo and others .
Cuba is still a fad that is unique in the world , and above all railway lover .
Steam of remote and brought the railways to the sugar factories .
Their vehicle fleet was not renewed over decades , and so , is there and fully functioning locomotives , whose lengthen contemporary elsewhere in the museum .
Trip goals
The places the majority of visitors from Cuba .
It must also be about varadero Havana have to write or not .
It remains only to mention that in the already mentioned estate a museum , whose visit , writers , these measures should not be .
The viñales-valley in the west of the island of Cuba is one of the angles .
The luxurious vegetation increases to lime ground .
The mogotas , lime hill and rock , rise sharply from the valley , in their hollow fertile ground water through which also adopt by a thick .
It is this valley where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is built on .
In its final form , you can meet him if you visit one of the cigar factories .
Perhaps it seems to some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV series `` major Zeman '' was turned .
Trinidad
An ancient city which shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island has been established .
Brought fame and wealth of the trade with slave and sugar .
The fortune embodied itself in the beauty of the small city .
The Spanish architecture , strongly influenced by the later French settlers , has hardly changed since four hundred years .
Trinidad between the sea and the is a sited remote place that there was still in the streets of the last century , not the area associated with the rest of the country .
This isolation contributed to its remaining unseen .
Nothing was built down , however , therefore also anything any was happy that he had a roof over the head .
If more than one afternoon time for Trinidad has , then it is worth interesting places them in the environment , such as the beach playa ancón or the `` valley of factories '' .
It should be at the Casa de la go following the darkness , and where the music not silent up to the morning .
Baracoa
This completely in the east than call on some of the most beautiful island .
Certainly this opinion is also by the way there .
Both the roads lead from Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerküftete mountains and run by a landscape , which is scarcely touched by human interventions .
UNESCO received this eastern outpost of Cuba , thanks to the pristine in its nature .
There the best chocolate is manufactured in the church , one shows the Cross of Columbus ( in fact , it is about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus came into being , and from the hill , where the former castle , the present hotel El Castillo , are to be seen , several of which El yunque is the best known .
Over the coffee , the rum , which cigars , which Sierra , the Bay and the island Isla de pinos , about the heiligtum of the Cuban patron caridad del cobre about the santeria , an African religion of the descendants of slaves stand above all , one could write many sides .
However , as one says so , looking better with own eyes .

Six as a deterrent , in order to annoy
E-mails which we forget , we never receive - harmless lies , do not strike us anymore at all , `` : '' at work to the weekday .
The question is whether one becomes of these small inconvenience to put it better , or to the challenge and attempts these misleading , for other annoying situations consciously .
Tips .
'Sorry , I forgot to tell you that somebody of the marketing referred - a colleague says `` .
That one missed a meeting through ?
At best one regrets it and it is again when maybe one phones the marketing department and admitting , one would have forgotten to align the report which is the usual method ) .
Mostly the thing with an apology .
Before it , embarrassing excuses , one should consider inspire his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously .
Something borrowed , which does not belong to one ?
There is hardly a little pithier than if a document , office accessories , or the telephone , but it is not there .
Yesterday , the still on the desk - it is today ?
Or is lost believed ballpoint pens , for example on a colleague 's desk ?
No one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow , because they are wonder if they find that something disappeared .
Thus , no covers or post office from the office put into the bag , because it could meet : no more because , if it 's nevertheless urgently needs .
Ratchet over the private life of the colleagues ?
There is no effective means , a which has already been put in the world to stop .
Who with whom , done something ?
Where and why ?
( IT ) The information or suggestions about the private life of colleagues not to give way to build the nose !
And if someone opens and tells us its internal secret nevertheless , we should not misuse this confidence !
Best one keeps quiet as a grave instead of just is not present to adjust even if other about the problems of colleagues know also answer .
Without reason sick self-employed ?
If one calls in the office in order invoking tormenting headaches sick to answer , because it just feels uneasy , or simply wants to rest , it should take a clear : one 's own work , urgent , projects with firm dates must now instead of one 's colleagues do .
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore !
If one already knows at that , in the next day into the office will not create , or that something could get in the way , for which one must stay at home , one should announce it in time so that neither the colleagues , nor the head unexpectedly with the absence .
Hum , tittering , phoning
One is hollow just in his work , but by the loud giggle of the colleagues disturbed ?
Unintentional a telephone conversation that one should not have heard better ?
One should not the colleagues with sums , singing , loud conversations ( one leads over their heads ) , trample , or permanent moaning nerve .
All of this can be very disturbing , even if they are not just in a task ( to write ) are planning to organize deepened .
The other is to blame ?
A project is not period ready , one has an important letter or forgotten important nachrichte to send , should be the fault of the own forgetfulness not look at other !
As far as possible one should not to the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues !
Best one admits his errors and excuses if others were also affected by it !
To combine the mistake again , or which missed retrieve can only too , is inadequate !
In the office - a sense as at home ?
Pants and schlapfen : force for at home , but has been lost in the office nothing !
Not even then one should dress so Leger if the job approved it actually !
Only not to become too - one should both his colleagues , and as far as that itself respect one dresses in according to the office - if desired , also pretty and elegant !

Test Peugeot 207 1.6 1.6 : voruteile fade
To tell the truth , I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206 .
Its driving were not much value to refer to the quality of the control as well as the processing could one as rather designate below average .
But now his successor , the Peugeot 207 , on the market and this is much better .
In combination with the designation sw is still go further and only remains for me to revise my opinion .
As I had tested the classical hatchback 207 , I had to complain about the too low , for example on the rear seats .
There are now no longer these complaints , because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer .
Fast further
I go by only in order not to repeat myself too very much .
It is a question of a quite succeeded design , where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel 's objections .
There I would welcome a little more designerische organization , where the car makes otherwise a so elegant impression .
The seats are comfortable , and past the times of where we too short seats or .
Even the side has fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206 .
Regarding the space is concerned , you here can feel the increased dimensions of the body .
In the combination of already mentioned lack of head freedom .
Suitcase into the trunk
The main thing at this step forward is the back seats .
( The I must also because of the reverse window ) as very well beladbar and space-saving .
The cavities are equipped with safety belts which represent an ideal compromise .
You do not disturb can and hold even more difficult objects .
But , we talk about the drawer volume .
It is according to table in the basic equipment 428 compared to competition , which is a rather average value .
Not compared to the vehicle of this class , the ? fabia .
If we take the 207 1.6 with the new generation of product from Mladá Boleslav compare , we find that the Peugeot around clearly perceptible 52 .
For a foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical .
But in order to emphasize the positiva , I must have the loading space completely flat after turning the back seats or also mention the very low .
120 HP in four row
Our was with a petrol engine with capacity of 1.6 litres and an achievement of 88 kilowatts .
And frankly , it should have a look , which propels a family .
It is quiet , has a small consumption and attract good way .
When I compare it with its counterpart with ? comparisons , which sometimes works as if its exhaust with a rag been blocked , then I can only be inspired by him .
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national .
We must remember , however , that we have a well equipped car with a spacious innneren and a very good engine .
The basic price of the car with the 1400th gasoline engine at the level of 329900 crowns still starts .
With our engine it costs from 410900 Crowns which is already quite a lot .
The equipment of the test car once again with 80000 crowns besides .
We had , however , bags automatic air conditioning , automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters behind and and ...
So the car costs in total 531900 crowns settles .
That is a lot , but they expect the options of a fabia once and they will arrive with a very similar sum .
Therefore only the decision , which mark one vote .

At the same time , he has praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out that he does not want to raise the appearance already have taken over the Presidency , because otherwise his political opponents would refer to this as arrogance .

Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss about the timetable of Bali , in which the measures for the period after 2012 , after the Kyoto protocols , are set .
Currently a fierce debate in progress between industry and development countries .
The United States has that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers , however , they would be ready until 2020 greenhouse gas emissions , the relative to 1990 , in order to reduce percent .
The other great question of the conference is whether the industrial countries are ready , the reduction of emissions in the developing countries both financially marching .
There is also an agreement about the support was achieved by developing countries .
The Kyoto protocols Adaptation Fund is supposed to be administered by a 16-koepfigen advice , presumably at the Global Environment Facility ( gef ) of the UN , as in the `` piac profit '' is posted .
Hungary 's six percent
Secretary of the States in the name of Hungary the effort of the EU took their with global , and to achieve a new international agreement to 2009 .

What role will play Putin after March ?
Prime Minister ?
Chairman of the majority in Parliament and the all-powerful party United Russia , the government and President will select ?
Whatever it will be , in the parliamentary and presidential elections , the previous power will triumph .
That is tradition .
The Russians the mentality of the Homo sovieticus , they are not wishing to their fate , mean the sociologist lev director of the independent Center levada .
The historian Nikolai from the State University St. Petersburg goes back even still further : the civil society , in this country which five centuries to Europe , only very slowly ; the famous esprit de corps delayed the development of individuality .
After the liberal reforms of the nineties Putin connected to the model of a paternalistic state , which was completely accepted by the population , all the more because on this new paternalism no terror followed , but a certain economic prosperity , Maria lipman means of the Carnegie Foundation .
Today the Russians renounce `` voluntarily with the personal responsibility which they after the collapse of the USSR on a short-term basis laid by the day .
To which still long held over ?
This phenomenon affects all social classes , including the business world .
And the administration understands it , to hold the status quo : 65 ( governors of 85 Russian region chairpersons ) lead the local lists of the United Russia .
The new , coming from the West freedoms are often tantamount to chaos , as in the 1990s .
The general public prefers stability .
In this sense , the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties .

The labour pains
Gordon Brown has yet another pit for falling ; its way from this remains the same .
For British scandals this is not especially slippery .
No nobility , sold , Parisian pays no politician , hotel bills have no toes .
But the revelation that a rich businessman ruling for the British Labour Party on more than 650.000 pounds ( 1.3 million ) over four years under the name of other people disguised , and that the party failed to announce this is something without the fought Gordon Brown good would have managed .
When two months ago the Prime Minister of the demand for an election had escaped from on stupid way the intelligence of the British offensive , when he said that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision there was hope that it would offer a robust , efficient government .
Instead , such as vince , increasingly astute agency chairmen of the Liberal Democrats , it expressed , the former brown from Stalin to Mr. bean .
The awkward rescue of northern rock , a bank , struggling weakness and bad discernment pointed under attack .
Badly thought out proposals to change the tax set against the government applied .
The loss of personal data of 25 million people demonstrated inconceivable administrative .
A trio of generals in the retirement started a revolt in the House of Lords in protest against shortening of military expenditure : to be Minister of the armed forces , so they have claimed , was a is .
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams ; Peter Watt , labours Secretary-General ( and their former fulfilment leader ) already resigned .
This means that brown breaks direction open .
Nevertheless governments can reach a turning point to which they feel impossibly to govern .
Neither like still people trust in politicians , but do they normally hold back their scepticism when a new force takes the office .
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister to improve the situation , and he does not even for a long time , this delay is past : the public service begins to become leaky ; the cabinet ministers to start ; the press looks for bad news ; and the defensive and aimless .
In a way the position of brown particularly difficult , because he compared to other political leaders can not claim to be a new broom .
So with pleasure it Tony Blair would deny , he was .
The problems with northern rock and the issue of , for example , together with decisions that brown made as a Chancellor of the Exchequer .
And even if not directly involved in Blairs of misfortunes - as in the case of the `` money for nobility '' of political party financing - may go to the voters that he was .
In spite of that situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The misdemeanours are not so terrible as the Conservatives describe it .
As with Mr. bean , nobody died , or was entirely cheated .
And the antidote , painful as it may be , is to be delivered , which of course Stalinist promised tendencies always : a reliable , solid and slightly brutal government .
The new fuss about political contributions is a good example .
The garboeske Abrahams , which compares his donations with his non-profit gifts , says he wants no public recognition for his goodwill .
That may be so , but the decision was not about him .
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and they exist for an unequivocal reason : the public has a right to know who is to have access to which rule over the country can be bought .
Watts says he would have known about Abraham 's agreement , but not that it is illegal , some questions must , of course , exactly as labours main finance recoverer the about the strange donations in October was told .
But so far Brown is not involved : there is nothing , that it indicates that he knew about this confusion , even though the largest part of the payments made after his taking office in June .
Up to now the Prime Minister finished half of the work .
He has fast violation of legislation by his party , but it diluted this determination by reaching for a well-known instrument , a committee of inquiry to the topic - led , in order to make the measure full of a bishop in retirement and a judge .
In this case , `` this is not to be pulled out very complicated .
If the law was broken , it is a matter for the police .
In addition , there are other things Mr Brown must do something , as a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life that has been vacant for six months and to advance with a drastic reform of political party financing .
That would require from the hardliners of labour to co-operate with the Conservatives and possibly in the special financial relationship with the trade unions - which bitter pills for a party comrade as Mr Brown .
But it should be conscious of some partial facts .
The Conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion polls ; it has two years to recover and voters ; the only way it can achieve a victory is through incontestable honesty and sound competence .

Wants to prepare - or as one becomes uninteresting
Stop and , the car right in the traffic .
From the radio a strange rings out : the sound of a violin , paired with electronic effects .
I turn the volume .
The speed changes , the bass comes to the previous sounds , and as a real choir .
It is the song `` wings of love of the '' , on onmr2 .
The domestic music scene has for a long time , not just with delicately .
However , now one sees even the traffic different if one hears the new album of .
The appearance of so many to new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground wearing slowly to a change of the overall picture , and even if the skirt with his gitarrengequitsche is again `` in '' the domestic proves : there is new under the sun .
In pécs Balázs , ranging from even in the volumes to before he - perhaps , because a pub no two piper - his own path to follow .
The breakthrough with his project ( zagar ) and its music which elements from jazz , electronic and pop , he only together , but as one with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film had approached him ( i.e .
`` szezon '' of Ferenc töroek ) .
The formation , which had arisen at first in smaller clubs , was known to the wider public first , as the magazine `` wan2 '' their first album from the year 2002 under the top 50 French and zagar , together with almost only to , for example , also in the West marketable trendsetter .
Without a doubt , and its volume `` trendy , '' it is not interested but whether they bear this brand also with pleasure .
The band reacted , as it should , with a new , even better album .
The now appeared new album entitled the `` can not walk fly '' could open new paths for them , but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the pécser years .
The expression originates indeed from the time when Balázs still away with another band .
The airy , flying allusion would be also in order , to fall , however , next to the character of the - the spirit and the trends louder , because of the influences of the rock piano 'n ' .
With these songs of living in England , and with the band `` the puzzle '' working singer himself during the premiere in .
A song of the album it even for the radio hit - since one from early to pop music late pet , `` This the listeners with the number of '' wings of love , `` the participation of six domestic singers stars '' ) ( `` received , successive the created .
All right , then ( ? ) .
The hvg.hu has enquired at Balázs .
Hvg.hu : this new raises the question : to what extent does your music of a certain shift remain reserved ?
Balázs : the term `` i '' means not just much .
In my opinion , there are two classes in the pop music , and indeed not mainstream and underground or and pop but rather commercial and honest .
Even the so-called alternative or underground can be shallow and meaningless , but also as it can only be produced for the sale of commercial power to music .
Also a good pop number can arise from an honest motive .
The acceptance of listener functions also according to this principle , independently of languages and borders .
Hvg.hu : do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and of foreign public your music ?
As zs . : abroad , in particular West of us the pop music has a greater tradition .
There not only on teenagers or concerts , but also the older audience .
They pursue the trends in the pop music , which happen around them , much more attentive , because they also for a part of the contemporary culture .
Hvg.hu : what role is attributed to the public during ?
It is important , who , where , how many hear your music ?
As zs . : it is , of course , a good sense to see that more and more to come to our concerts .
We must never , however , for the market .
For the music does not arise in order to serve a purpose , but for a particular reason .
The role of the public is perceptible mostly at the concerts , where there is already a mutual interaction , but there is only prolong the unreachable changes of the moment .
Nevertheless , one struck me : you want to make it all right , you are not more interesting .
Hvg.hu : how far you like to follow the example of ?
He is under way , and as has his career in the West .
As zs . : we do not in fact his way , once completely disregarded the fact that one attempts again and again in our music .
We see rather than which on the presence of other musical trust and they unfolded .
At the beginning of our work , comparisons with the inevitable to , as several of us come from his band and took another way .
Hvg.hu : in the wings of `` wings of love '' stands in the first place .
Many have only in connection with this number is the name .
Was the opening with a somewhat style in the direction of a wider public conscious ?
As zs . : we had no plans to write a train horse , then for the excuses .
Here it is a question of more song .
It was considered as a final of the , with which we and the a little more difficult issues will disappear .
Hvg.hu : how did you the six singers ?
Why is it , which was the guidance principle ?
As zs . : the idea was to make a gospel well-behaved chorus .
Then came the talented choir from soloists of the indigenous music scene .
So the six-headed choir arose - for sena , edina kutzora , péterfy , eniko `` hodosi [ neo ] , sena , , which then we '' apäter stars `` underground .
Hvg.hu : you have the song just or do have it the girls ?
As zs . : there was the number in the longer , but when the material was ready for the album , we thought that this number is `` something needs '' .
The piecework has positively asked for a song voice .
I still rings out in the same night , later the girls learned it .
There has been virtually everything immediately and frightening spontaneous .
I can remember , I was then fairly , but it has already needed the `` stars '' as well .
With my voice alone the song would never have become .
Hvg.hu : both on the plate , as well as in concert had the impression , the girls would be in the background .
There is not any solo ( except for the short solo of ) , they have no own role completely sing together and are not louder than the music , therefore their gesang not only accompanied from the music .
Also on the stage they stood behind .
Is it intention ?
B.zs . : that they are stood at the rear was so because of purely technical problems .
However we wanted to them consciously not solo roles .
In the number is also that you forget his ego a little bit , who have forgotten where and where it is on the way , we are simply too , that this particular wing , the wings of the love .
I would like that also other sense this euphoric State we felt when the song arose .
Hvg.hu : what was the most extensive song ?
As zs . : during the musical work work actually none , it has rather while mixing more difficult tasks .
For example with `` dorian Gray 's dilemma '' , in which I play on a or with `` rock piano 'n goes to the girls '' where the groove not work longer , but little by little everything turned out , as in the case of a puzzle .
Hvg.hu : what is your album of the new ?
As zs . : that changes with the concerts constantly and also now , where I have the album `` losgelasssen '' .
Currently it is `` prophet is a '' , `` escape from the earth '' and the number of `` never the same '' .

In the realm of Angela cloud
The unrealistic appearance of the Chancellor documents that with regard to the contents of the coalition is at the end of it - and that nothing is more to expect .
In which country does this Federal Chancellor actually ?
After their hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag and meaningless , one must say : not here - not in the country that would have to be governed by it at last .
The accusation that it concentrates too much on the foreign policy , Angela Merkel , with a badly arrogant sentence rejected .
That is provincial , she said , and thus showed first that it does not want to understand , for it is a matter for the critics .
In Parliament it has been documented for all visible as their accusation is very true .
Neither concrete interest was present nor to feel a sense of the problems in the country .
Instead , Angela cloud presented itself : a removed politician who in the foreign policy and even there in the approximate .
Example climate protection : there it praises without brakes for the resolutions of holy dam but does not say how parts climatic goals are to be achieved .
Anyway , the self-praise - so much had presumptuousness still two years ago .
Now she clings to the empty phrase that the upswing arrives at the people .
It damages its image as a pragmatist , solve the problems instead of talking the world beautifully .
But in the realm of Angela cloud an edge appearance domestic problems .
Child poverty and the concerns of the low earners ?
She has a few subordinate clauses for .
It is characteristic how often it promises when it came to the children .
She needs three approaches there in order to bring out a sentence straight .
She stumbles as on foreign terrain if it becomes concrete .

At the most expensive , Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in also have this year the average increase in prices of 16 % from the last year , with the difference this year that there is no increase in the value-added tax .
Article from napi gazdaság
In the budaoerser , the price of the usual Christmas `` napi '' also this year around 16 % were increased , but in all price increases of more registered .
After the prices in the food markets last December `` , '' the price increase not out to be drastic , compared with the previous already high level .
However , it has an effect on consumers certainly as a deterrent that that is what they are , in the last year still far below paid hoof , not even for 10,000 this year is available .
The price of the `` napi '' basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof studied in the markets .
The highest price amounted hoof .
( the price , at 6.800 . )
The prices for unicum and live fish almost remained on previous , have , on the other hand the prices for nut and poppy .
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary , there were cut , however , for forint 139 .
There was no mention product limited price slump with less than 200 forint .
This is also what the price of a stroke of under two Coca-Cola 200 forint , thus the drink cost including pledge only in 257 .
Nevertheless , this year in the `` napi '' at the most expensive and at best .
Our calculations indicate that the prices in the `` napi '' market basket vis-à-vis the Christmas prices in the last year , while Tesco around 15 and 18 % cut in each case raises .
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of this year amounted to 12 % , while the increase between market basket of last year and this year formed of 21 % .
The average price rise , 1.480,00 .
The average increase in prices was still at 1,206.00 last year , however , the tax increase in prices to apparent last Christmas .
Just this process found the trade badly : seemingly the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they should use in the individual articles , because the effects of the increase in prices for the consumer , unpredictable .
( if the vendor is on the rotation speed of a product badly , it can fall around essential profits in the price margin that follows the undertaken . )
The price increase of the `` napi '' turned out in the last year so radically , that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 about 1720 exceeded , whereas the difference in prices at the cheapest basket only 844 forint was .
This year such extremes were not observed , as the most expensive basket cost about 1.630,00 forint more than in the previous year , and even at the cheapest there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00 .
In the comparison of the two last Christmas showed a catastrophic increase in prices , the price of the daily consumer items on the in less than 20 months for more than 30 % per year .
( this is not necessarily confirmed the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary , with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months a more than a price increase .
So in about beside flour also with eggs . )
However , one looked into the `` napi '' market basket , this seems almost impossible with the latter , because the price of the product already in the previous year even in the worst case for little more than 10 per cent .
Obviously are in a stronger position than the egg - after all they could the drastic increase in prices to the multis shift .
In the golden the hypermarkets do not complain , constantly about good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more .
From all large quantities are bought , lasting foods go in over the counters .
Wednesday morning , all three department stores endless with the cash when suddenly the number of customers exploded .
However , the country is a smaller customer frequency reports , so that many multis deplore themselves with the , they could not achieve even the planned turnover , and not just with food , but also with lasting consumer goods .

Of a given a name , it was presented for a court in Khartoum today .
After indicating their attorney , the British teacher in Sudan , the accused of insult of the Islam on Thursday evening , by a court in Khartoum to 15 days detention and following classification .
The Briton was accused , allowed to pupils six to seven year old to have , a Teddy bear to give the name , although any representation of the prophet is prohibited .
They would have deserved to be whipped .
After parents of pupils had complained repeatedly near the Sudanese Ministry of Education , the education and cultural in the unity high school of was active on Sunday with themselves at home and picked up to Article 125 of the Sudanese penal code of the insult of Islam .
In fact , this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher their pupils six to seven year to contribute a name for the choice .
The children suggest eight names , including Hassan , Abdullah and Mohammed , Robert boules reports .
Finally , when the class co-ordinates 20 of 23 children of Mohammed choose as like first name .
Certainly , Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophets , but it is also a first name very frequent in Sudan .
Then the children a book for the class , with the photo of the bear on that and the caption is my name Mohammed .
The bear did not carry a label with this name , but the problem is simply that the representation of the Islamic prophet regarded as an insult of the Islam .
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons , teaches Sudan at the same school , said that he knows it well , and she would never have something would have done , and to close a religious belief , I can only regret that she asked the children , a name to vote for his opinion is only a `` innocent error .
An opinion that numerous pupils of the teacher of these as very attentive to their pupils and as a person , who never talks about religion in the class describe .
One considers that the first name Mohammed in Great Britain at is the most frequent given , for which in English 14 different exist .
This first name often selected by Moslem families is seen as a kind of respect at the prophet ( it is frequently given a family holds ) .
But how do the rules in the reference to the use of this first name ?
One must give it for example a toy ?

According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference that forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-government organizations , but also of the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it , and the reality .
`` the debate there is unstructured , it is some word fireworks that only substitute for a real solution of current problems '' said Klaus .
The Czech President stressed during the idea of his book that his issue is very important for it , and that he commits itself to that so therefore .
He also expressed its satisfaction over the fact that his book appears in German translation because `` I often at the caricatures of my views . ''
Now business prospects could therefore read its setting .
Klaus reminded that it was not klimatologe , but it has in his opinion sufficient conditions in order to write such a book .
It is finally academics , able to understand professional discussions and to judge , has experience with statistics and is also .
As a main statement of the book he referred to the thesis that the climate is changed continuously and that its changes are therefore normal , that there is no to global warming matching opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and , therefore , no threat represented and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate , superfluous , ineffective expensive and .
In addition he considers it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian , unacceptable opinions on other ones , to impose he regards that as a dangerous restriction of freedom .
At present , when he said that he is not against `` a reasonable environmental protection , however against militant who take no consideration on the relationship between expenditure and profit . ''
On the same issue in Vienna Klaus had already two months ago in the spoken .

At what here may reveal : aimed demands showed that the name to it through the collective , but by no means for achieving sustainable volume for 32 years painfully to miss .
But why not also the German celebrate his existing legends from the seventy years ?
With what is called the misleading in England and America was always more than in its own country .

That is not warhols boxes
Who the concepts Sweden and wood thinks Ikea , but not at Andy in .
Or ?
In Sweden now take a dark shadow over warhols .
A large part of the listed there of the `` Stockholm '' are forgeries .
After the Swedish newspaper `` expresses some months ago about the genuineness of Andy warhols of companies in 1968 , internal investigations come in in in the Stockholm now for a result : the six boxes '' , `` former of Museum in 1995 as the the donation has bequeathed are copies - and probably the majority of the about a hundred more of the '' , `` the Stockholm on the international art market in circulation .
The case history is encapsulated , a confusing artistic and kuratorischer productions .
In 1964 , created in New York his first boxes `` , '' the painted wooden on the design of the cardboard boxes of the soap `` brillo '' .
An exhibition of his work in 1968 in the thought - with warhols agreement - hundreds of brillo cardboard : these ( derived from cost reasons ) , but they were not , directly from the brillo board mill .
It was not a question of works of art , but their models to mere exhibits .
At the same time , in 1968 presumably the permission of a few brillo wooden produce in Sweden , but not in the in the were switched off .
Time witnesses speak now of about fifteen boxes which then as authorized original-andy-warhol-brillo-boxes with the names `` Stockholm '' to right in the art and auction history .
Some of them are more than 100 000 dollars on auctions escalation .
The problem is now that the legendary director of Museum has claimed later by mistake , it is about a hundred 1968 boxes in Sweden was produced and issued left to him then .
Indeed , only in 1990 105 boxes for an exhibition in PC St. Petersburg .
It was already three years dead .
Lars bystroem , on in the curator , along with the six museum boxes even three from Swedish private property , of which two 1968 in Stockholm were made : your pressboard plates were first and ground after , that , with a white laid on .
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 , on the other hand betrays that the without with a coat directly on the laid on it - it was not a question of oil , but also about color .
`` these boxes were not autorisiert from artists and from the official list of Andy warhols '' can be removed , the director of the Lars in , announce : `` when the 'Andy in kind board ' in New York not to another , the conclusion will in the six boxes in his collection as copies / classify . ''

Budget is through
Yes , it is created .
The national budget is approved .
What is special one at this budget ?
It is the first budget which this government projected , and without the support of opposition was accepted .
For the current year still with the ssd ( social democrats ) , because it ministers endorsed ( of this party ) had submitted , and it therefore could not allow to refuse it .
Unlike the lively debate in front of the vote on the motion of no against the government nothing dramatic happened this time .
The Parliament approved have noticed , yet this is highly important law calmly .
This is , as it were , the paradox here .
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget , whether one likes or not .
The budget is an essential component of the policy , however covered by the power of the government and the opposition .
This is a topic for the media , and therefore they dedicate more attention to it .
A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the public as a sober numbers .
The national budgets suffered from the last social democratic governments under three weak points that the budget for the year 2008 at the same time eliminate not :
The first is the high proportion of spending , because of law obliging , at which it does not only concern the pensions , but also to the spending the `` implicit '' coalition of ssd and ksm ( Communists ) in the last year before the choices .
The second is the fiscal account as a consequence of the first .
The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances , i.e . the deficits of the municipalities .
The greatest risk is not , however , the state budget deficit .
This budget is public and eingermassen under control .
A real time bomb is , however , the budget deficit of the Communities .
Many mayors gave in order to save incomes from taxes , and bank credits further sources for investments , often mostly from financing through which they caused their city halls in the excess .
In recent years , enabling them , these debts by massive sales of stocks of energy and other supply networks , in which they had received from the State to pay off .
Now this source has already dried up .
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts , we find that :
Our economy for some years , as the rest of the world , a growth through , whose incessantly boasts about ran the .
That represented a unique possibility for their governments , public finances in order .
Instead , the state of these governments were , however , still more .
Other countries , apart from a few exceptions , such as Hungary , Albania , Pakistan or Egypt , have much more reasonable than our Republic .
That is a giant disgrace which mainly be ascribed to the former governments .
We belong to the countries in the global scale , seen the least of poverty are threatened .
This is not , unfortunately , social nassiven needed just in the last years very in gigantic extent was blown up .
Even if it is able , a part of the unreasonable populist spending , which were adopted this year before the elections , altogether , if it is clear that soon lead to a shift of the pension entry age and come to a reform , then virtually any policy in this country , and , very quickly , who is in power , he will not have anything as a pure administration .
It is only easily exaggerated if it is , then , that existing officials from politicians , who are the largest part of the tax revenues mechanically on pensions and social .
Therefore the this year 's budget can not be a revolution , but it can only the expulsion of normal outputs by duty .
The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if former governments in the last ten years have not spent , which only worked .
If we do not want that in fact it results in that , at verwaltungsbeamte from ruling politicians , then we must be patient and this strong coalition government too , that it is conscious that the state can issue only as much as he taxes and fees is able to take rest during the preparation of further wish .
Only these facilitate a gradual enforcement of a balanced budgets .

In addition to Gulfstream more than 200 other deluxe suppliers had built up exhibition stands , on it hoping to interest newly come into money Russians in all from mahogany-panelled yachts up to diamond-coated autobarbecue which would be measured for 50 cents .
Firer took carefully shining orange Porsche in the next exhibition stand in the visor .
`` This is a nice car , but it is a change in comparison to us , `` he said .
`` To the United States Russia is the second largest market for private airplanes. ``
Heated up by an oil boom the Russian capital appears so floods with money like Dallas at his brilliant times .
`` We have gone by the same phase in the 1890th when some Americans came to huge wealth and went to crowds to Europe where they were looked as materialist `` , said Marshall Goldman , a scientist in Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies in Harvard university .
Like the Saudi-Arabian achievers of the 1970th and the Japanese in the 1990th , the Russians come out as the freigiebigen monetary output units most visible in the world .
The most exclusive deluxe brands search her interest in the gold fever .
Somewhere else in Moscow has pulled this week a conference of the deluxe industry Donatella Versace , Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault , the chairperson of LVMH , to exchange ideas about how one can sell hochpreisige goods at markets like Russia .
( The conference is organized by The Internationally Herald tribunes which New York Times Company hears . )
Russia has 53 multi-millionaires who own a total of 282 billion dollars , according to which Forbes Liste of the richest people .
In addition , 103,000 Russian millionnaires belong to the second class which are worth together 670 billion dollars , according to a study about the development of private property in the former Soviet Union which was written about economic experts of the center for economic researches and finance researches , to an expert 's committee here .
( The world bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived under the subsistence level . )
`` There are hundreds of millionnaires in Moscow - therefore , we are everything here `` , said Nicole Marais , a sales and marketing representative of David Morris , a London jeweller .
She had visited for the first time together with the Russian trader of the brand , the Soho Jewelry Group , the fair .
`` The women are maintained everything exemplarily and the men are worth everything a property. ``
While they pull Sunday night in evening dress by the halls , two estate agents , Evgenia Yumatova , 21 , and Svetlana Turovtsova call , 26 , themselves and her clients millionnaires .
`` I have looked after the cars and I try to decide between the Infiniti , the Mercedes and Porsche `` , Mrs. Yumatova , they said the designer clothes which she carried , delivered , how a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers .
The fair seemed to be aimed it , primarily , at the nouveau riches , the type of Russian buyers conscious of brands who be would ready to stand several hours in the traffic jam to visit a drafty warehouse which put next to each other geschmachloserweise Cadillac Escalades , penknife from platinum , Mövenpick ice cream , tailor-made Billiardtische , Appartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears .
The general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ( 44.57 dollars ) .
`` The Russians are to be learned with interest at the fact which brand is most expensive and best `` , said Mr. Gijrath who sat patriotically in an exhibition stand of the Dutch of porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before wandgroßen Imitat of a Rembrandt 's picture from hand-painted , blue tessellated stones .
`` Of course Russians are interested more in Klimper-Klimper. ``
Indeed , the traders say here that itself the Russians with old money ( 10 to 15 years is old after Russian standards ) have already moved from pompous logos to the kind of sober brand with restricted numbers of pieces which would not market themselves in a commercial show .
Nevertheless , pressed several Thousand people , whether millionnaires , envoys of millionnaires or simply tourists every day by the halls .
And some of them shopped .
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday said Roman Ershov , the general manager of King Koil beds here , he would have sold two 70,000 dollars of mattress set , made of silk , cashmere and cotton , with sewed in golden threads .
Likewise at the first night said Mikhail Lyubiumov , a sales manager for A1 Moto , a company the high final cars with high final alarm systems equips that his company has sold garish orange Porsche for 170,000 dollars to a Russian millionnaire .

He showed to a reporter a tire which was developed for a Russian casino owner , with the spokes which he had covered with colored Swarovski to crystals , so that it looked like a roulette wheel .
The costs : 22,000 dollars for a 4-substitute .
`` The Russian millionnaire who would like to have bunches leather wheels or a picture of the face of his wife of cubic zirconium will not necessarily go on these wheels `` , said Mr. Karapetian .
`` He will keep it in his 30-or 40 cars garage. ``
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich , Mr. Karapetian said , the phrase `` Russiche of millionnaires `` would not express at the moment a lot of exclusivity , in view of the increase of the local real estate prices .
`` If you have bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago , they are supposed already millionnaire , at least on the paper if already in cash `` , he did not say .
`` There is more of those than you believe. ``
Those which were no millionnaires could act at least in such a way , as if they were rich in a state which was pursued by Alliance Continental , a Russian administration of property enterprise .
The enterprise had put up four red phone booths according to British model which were stuffed with mountains by wrong millions-dollar lights .

It to all want to prepare - or how one becomes dull for others
Stop and go traffic , the car in the middle of taking place every morning traffic jam .
From the radio there sounds a strange melody : The sound of a violin , combined with electronic effects .
I turn the volume higher .
The tempo changes , to the present sounds comes the bass , and as a real sound jewel a female choir .
It is the song `` Wings of Love '' of Zagar which sounds on mr2 .
The home music scene has spoiled us for a long time not exactly with qualitative Electropop .
But now one sees even the traffic jam different if one hears , besides , the new album from Zagar .
The appearance of Yonderboi , quite a lot of new and thrilling production from the home digital Underground scene slowly contribute to a change of the general view , and even if the garage rock with his Gitarrengequitsche is again `` in '' which proves home Electropop : There is new under the sun .
Balázs Zságer has started in Pécs , made music even in the volume Yonderboi , before he started to walk - maybe because a pub stands no two pipers - his own way .
He created the breakthrough with his project ( Zagar ) and his music which melts elements from jazz , Electronic , and pop , however , only when one with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film , had moved up to him ( e.g .
`` Szezon '' of Ferenc Török ) .
The formation which had appeared in the beginning in smaller clubs only became known to the broader audience than the magazine `` wan2 '' lined up her first album from the year 2002 under the top to 50 home albums and chose Zagar , together with Yonderboi , to the nearly only trendsetter also capable of market in the west .
Undoubtedly Zagar and his tape were `` trendy '' , however , it interested nobody whether they carry this brand also with pleasure .
The tape has reacted as it should go : With a new , still better album .
The new album appeared now with the title `` Can not Walk Fly Instead '' could open new ways for them , indeed , the title already expresses the wish for continuity with the Pécser years .
The expression is descended since from the time when Balázs Zságer was on the move still with another volume .
The aerial , flying allusion would be also in order , indeed , they strike beside the ethereal character of the music - to the spirit of the times and the trends suitable - pure guitar , the influence of the rock'n'roll .
With these songs `` The of jigsaw puzzle `` working singer György Ligeti with the première has fancied in England living and with the volume in the Millenáris .
A song of the album has created it even to the radiohit - since newest from morning till night pop music sending mr2 Petőfi has put the earwig to the listeners with the number `` Wings of Love '' which was taken up in collaboration with six home singers ( `` Underground of divas `` ) successive .
Everything in order .
Hvg.hu has asked with Balázs Zságer .
hvg.hu : This new hit throws up the question : To what extent is your music of a certain layer left ?
Balázs Zságer : The concept `` Layer music '' signifies to me not exactly a lot .
In my opinion there are two castes in the pop music , namely not mainstream and Underground , or Alternatively and pop , but Commercially and honestly .
Even the so-called Alternatively or Underground music can be shallow and be inexpressive , however , just they can be even produced for the sales which play musik they too more commercially .
Also a good pop number can originate from an honest motive .
The admission readiness of the listener also functions after this principle , from languages and land borders independently .
hvg.hu : Are you up a difference in the openness of the Hungarian one and the foreign audience of your music ?
B. Zs . : Abroad , in particular to the west of us the pop music has a bigger tradition .
There go not only teenagers or Twens on concerts , but also the older audience .
They pursue the trends in the pop music which happen round them , much more carefully because they hold them also for a part of the contemporary culture .
hvg.hu : Which role comes to the audience to at your work ?
Is it important , who , where how many hear your music ?
B. Zs . : Of course it is a good feeling to see that come more and more to our concerts .
However , we have never composed for the market .
With us the music not originates to serve a purpose , but for certain reason .
The role of the audience is mostly perceptible with the concerts where there is already a mutual interaction , but there is that again only in the unhandy changes of the moment .
Still has struck me one : If you want to make it to all right , you are no more interesting .
hvg.hu : How far would like you to follow the example of Yonderboi ?
He is on the move as a soloist and has built up his career rather in the west .
B. Zs . : We do not go really his way , sometimes of it completely seen that one tries over and over again , this in our music hineinzuinterpretieren .
We see ourselves rather than a team player which allow to trust in the musical presence of the other and develop them .
In the beginning comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were unavoidable of course , because several of us from his tapes come and have smashed another way .
hvg.hu : In the charts from mr2 Petőfi `` Wings of Love '' stands , firstly .
Many have heard only in connection with this number the name Zagar .
Was the opening with a little more popular style produced in the direction of a broader audience consciously ?
B. Zs . : We had no plans to write a hit which should hold out then as a draft horse for the album .
In this song it goes around more .
It was intended as a finale of the album with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult subjects .
hvg.hu : How have you selected six singers ?
Why just they what was the leading principle ?
B. Zs . : The basic idea was to do a gospel song-like choir .
Then there came the idea to put together the choir from gifted soloists of the home music scene .
Thus the 6-headed choir has originated - Sena , Edina Kutzora , Judie Jay , Bori Péterfy , Enik ő Hodosi [ Neo ] , Juci Németh - which we have christened then apäter `` Underground of divas `` .
hvg.hu : Wanted you to have the song just , or have the girls coformed it ?
B. Zs . : There was the number long since in the instrumental version , but when the material was ready for the album , we imagined that this number still needs `` something `` .
The chord sequence has asked formally for a song voice .
I have the melody still at the same night eingesungen , later they have learned the girls .
Everything came practically right away and alarmingly spontaneously .
I can remember , at that time I was quite electrified , but it has required already also of the `` divas '' .
With my voice the song would never only have become so strong .
hvg.hu : However , on the record , as well as with the concert one had the impression , the girls would be in the background .
There is no solo part ( apart from short Solo from Judy Jay ) , they have no own role , sing completely together and are not louder than the music , is accompanied thus her song by the music not only .
Also on the stage they stood behind .
Is it an intention ?
B.Zs . : The fact that they have stood behind , was because of purely technical problems in such a way .
Indeed , we wanted to let them consciously no solo roles come up .
In the number it is also about the fact that one should forget his ego a little , forget who is on the move where from come and where , we simply allow that to us these certain wings , the wings of the love raise .
I would have with pleasure that also other feel this euphoric state which we have felt when the song has originated .
hvg.hu : Which was the costliest song ?
B. Zs . : At the musical creating work , actually , none , it has given rather with the mix more difficult tasks .
For example , with the `` Dorian Gray '' s dilemma `` in which I play on a concert piano , or with `` rock'n'roll of Goes To The Girls `` where the grooving did not want to function longer , however , bit by bit everything has fitted together , how with a jigsaw puzzle .
hvg.hu : Which is your favorite number of the new album ?
B. Zs . : This changes with the concerts constantly and also now where I have the album `` losgelasssen '' .
Nowadays these are `` prophet Is A Fool '' , `` Escape From The Earth '' and the number `` Never The of seed `` .

However , the army must also fight against amateur 's admissions which create it beside the carefully worked on , zensurierten admissions likewise in the net - as for example those which show the death of the soldiers : In to some deceitful , `` official '' propaganda films it is at most spoken about the losses , nevertheless , the bloody sides of the war are not shown .
Numerous videos in use rotated in the application on the platform were loaded , by the way , already by the theatres of war in Iraq and in Afghanistan , the Britons have discovered this `` type '' , however , only a short time ago for themselves .
The Americans advertise meanwhile in the a little bit other kind , namely with the free of charge downloadable shooting play `` America 's Army '' in which the player can slip within the scope of a simulation more or less loyal to life in the skin of the soldier .

Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
The Venus is intended in spite of her life-hostile atmosphere of the earth more similarly than up to now : The European space probe `` Venus of express train `` has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind whirl to the Pole how they appear in winter also on the earth .
For nearly three decades scientists suppose that it flashes on the Venus .
Now the European probe has produced `` Venus of express train `` the proof - she tracked down electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere : The flashes on the Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud , reports Christopher Russel about the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine `` Nature '' .
According to the famous `` Ursuppen theory '' flashes let the life on the earth originate : Thunderstorms should have stimulated in the ocean reactions which led to the education of amino acids , the stones of the life .
Not thus on the Venus : `` If was one day life there , it must have been in the very early history `` , explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington .
Today there might be on the surface of the Venus barely something living : The atmosphere is thicker about hundred times than on the earth , there rule every now and then temperatures of 500 degrees .
`` The Venus is maybe the devil 's twin of the earth , but she is a twin `` , said Russian
Why the Venus which is so similar to the earth in mass and size has hit such a totally other development , is the basic question of the Esa mission .
The start of `` Venus of express train `` in November , 2005 was a landmark for the Venus research , because since beginning of the nineties no more probe was on the move specially to the investigation of this planet .
The newest research results which are introduced now in several `` Nature '' articles underline in the opinion of the researchers not only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system .
`` You also show that the common characteristics of our neighbouring planet with the earth are bigger than at first accepted `` , informs the Esa .
Thus the researchers also found a cloud whirlpool in the South Pole which still turns substantially faster beside the already known whirlwind on the North Pole .
The phenomenon reminds of airflows on the earthly winter hemisphere , writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni about the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica .
The most second-internal planet of the solar system has almost the same mass like the earth and is big with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers almost just .
The planet also called morning or evening star circles in just 225 days round the sun .
However , he turns much more slowly on himself : A Venus day lasts 243 earth days .
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure of 92 reminds cash barely of the earth , scientists assume from the fact that both planets have originated under quite similar conditions .
On both water collected which remained on the earth in oceans , however , on the Venus got lost in the space .
And while carbon dioxide on the earth is fixed in carbonate rocks , it puts out on the Venus the large part of the atmosphere .

Food responsible in European inflation
A principal reason for the increase measured in the eurozone of the inflation are the rapidly rising food prices .
In 13 lands of the eurozone the price increase was higher in November than expects - after which 2.6 percent in October an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered as the statistical office of the EU reports in Luxembourg .
Official predictions have gone out from only 3 percent , announced Bloomberg .
In contrast to American , British , and Canadian issuing bank the European central bank ( EZB ) has not lowered the Leitzsins . After your judgement the rising raw material prices and the light decline of the unemployment the origin of an inflation spiral would favor the lowering of interest rates .
The EZB is bestrebt to hold the inflation rate less than two percent , or at least briefly in the 2-percent brand .
According to an analyst the EZB is in the catch-22 situation : One must `` arrange '' the inflation to exclude later action need .
With 3.3 percent the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve year-record high ; in Spain climbed the rate from 3.6 to 4.1 percent .
Responsibly for the increase of the inflation in the eurozone are the risen food and energy prices .
The wheat quotations MATIF rose by 88 percent , and the course for soy beans likewise reached a record high since 1973 .
Also with edible oil and milk products there was a considerable price increase in 2007 .
The world price for crude oil rose this year by 52 percent - last month the price per barrel of the black gold reached nearly 100 USdollars .
The EZB according to will rise the inflation in 2008 from 2.1 to 2.5 percent , indeed , one counts in 2009 on a decline on 1.9 percent .
For the coming 3-4 months analysts go out from a 3-percent inflation rate , number the annual average rate , however , with 2.1 percent .
For 2008 experts calculate on the fact that the EZB will lower the interest twice .

The fathers of the herbal rock return
Supergroup of Germany of the seventy-year-olds makes music again : Three tape members of Harmonia planned for her consoles with a concert in Berlin once more .
To the revival a recording from her big time `` appears Live in 1974 `` .
Even then they were substantially more famous abroad .
Then the fixed sensation occurs in the form of three sedate men in the evening board .
Everybody has his small box before itself , his cables and above all his buttons .
Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the snow-white shirt at the age of 63 years in the middle .
On the left flanks from Michael Rother , 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar .
On the right , from the lecture hall looks , Hans-Joachim Roedelius , 73 curves , concentrates in the console .
Everybody contributes noises , every now and then even a beat .
And sometimes it submits by mistake to a customary piece of music .
Then this also seems to disturb men even not largely .
The fact that the volume Harmonia makes music again , has provided among herbal rock-lovers for some excitement .
And one may reveal here : Specific inquiries proved that the name whirred , indeed , through the collective pop memory , but by no means so with lasting effect to miss this tape for 32 years painfully .
But why should the German not be allowed to celebrate also his living legends from the seventies ?
Particularly as that what calls delusively herbal rock , counted in England and America always more than in own land .
When the music economy lent to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003 the echo price of life work , one saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces .
As the Red Hot chilli Peppers to itself in the eulogy still with the volume La Dusseldorf and Anew ! thanked , the surprise knew no borders .
With concerts Michael Rother crouched later with the Red Hot chilli Peppers on the stage like an old pal .
Away from home that is the problem of the ignorance at home and the transfiguration one .
The memory is demanded too much if only for that with Harmonia because the trio only two years existed and unfolded in this time also a far lower effect power than them afterwards from others was assigned .
Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler already before under the promising name Cluster .
At first one played in the cellar under the Berlin show stage .
Afterwards in Dusseldorf , for economic reasons for one flat label maintained by the church .
Rother had briefly helped out with power station and afterwards as a guitarist with Anew ! , the German group most radical maybe at that time , a call wins .
However , about 1973 Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile after forest in the Weser mountainous country .
There , in the old Weser court , ruins from the 16-th century , they lived as a town-brief Kommunarden .
Less ideologically than in the local authority district I where might slave Roedelius still as a nanny .
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist 's existence .
Supposedly a pennon of the song association Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art a name was also found in the bulky refuse .
Something held on Harmonia of it .
The first album called `` music of Harmonia `` and the following `` De Luxe '' .
Since thus let and give the music also sounded , the tape suffered material need .
The brushwood collecting served not only the Selbstfindung .
The CD appeared now `` Live in 1974 `` was recorded with a concert in Griessem , before a just 50-headed record scenery , as somebody believes to remember .
At that time from Rother came the wish to force Harmonia and to practice now and then .
For Roedelius and Moebius an indecent demand .
The tape explained in 1975 her separation .
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and protected itself his existence with albums like `` blazing hearts `` .
Cluster was animated in the eighties again and is more successful since that time than it was Harmonia ever .
The Griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert Grönemeyer .
His record company Greenland has sat down it to the purpose to maintain the herbal rock as a very own German contribution to the living music .
Anew ! besides , it was already dug out like Roedelius solo work .
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world .
Publicly subsidized , within the scope of the festival Woldtronics .
Julian Cope is there , the Briton , old punk and author of the manual `` herbal rock of sampler `` .
There the Love Parade inventor Dr. is also a moth .
With which the whole range of the influence of the herbal rock on the following pop music would be outlined .
Besides , the empty place of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia .
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most strange sounds in the hall : `` The only true music , you hear the future. ``
There are pictures which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse parlour .
Projections of other black-and-white photos of chaotically cabled tools serve the laying education .
Before it three veterans are occupied with the improvisation again .
No more , while they stick microphones to the organ and in the percussion to draw incredible tones of the instruments over self-tinkered effect devices .
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music .
Three tinkerers detailed in the technical .
The choir of the house also changes nothing in it .
Under the management of Barbara Morgensterns it is coughed under sound clouds and is whispered and at a nice place with emphasis `` Aaaaaaaah ! `` chanted .
Herbal rock was always a very English concept .
It never concerned rock .
The roots were searched less in blues , than in colleges of music ( Can ) , technologies ( power station ) or on the run before artistic and social conventions ( cluster ) .
Who here `` in '68 ! `` shouts , is not wrong completely , and Harmonia can be brought by it also now not from the rest .
Still the most natural is roofed on the stage thoroughly .
Where does music start and when does it stop ?
This can rob one of the nerves or give brief moments of big luck .

Formed an alliance in Afghanistan are passive , state Americans .
Not enough soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influences according to the United States the course of the mission in Afghanistan .
NATO should sketch according to the words of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates a concrete plan for the next years .
The mission in Afghanistan does not run according to her images , the representatives of the lands who have stationed unities in the south of the land agreed in Scottish Edinburgh about it .
Beside the growing opposition of sides of the Taliban eight participant states also discuss other coordination plans among the allies .
While the United States called the Nato unities for more activity by her Verteigungsminister Robert Gates , Great Britain sees the priority in the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and in the intensification of the development aid .
`` In Afghanistan a Vorwärtsentwicklung is perceptible , but military power can be only one part of the solution .
Another part consists in allowing to the inhabitants , in beginning even a development of the economy and security , `` says the British Verteigungsminister of the Browne of the BBC .
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest state for five years according to the American army .
The number of power actions has risen in comparison to year before by 27 percent , in the southern province Helmand even about sixty percent .
The Nato lands have stationed in Afghanistan about 40000 soldiers , of it possibly one quarter in the southern territory .
However , according to the United States the allies have bumped to an absolute border what concerns organization and equipment of the unities .
Specifically they demand other helicopters , soldiers and experts to the training of the Afghan unities .
`` We will seriously have to think about the concrete purposes for the next time and about the way how we can reach them , `` said gates .

`` I am not delighted about what we have at disposal in Afghanistan to land and in the air .
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment which we would need , and this is not enough , `` De Hoop of the agency said Reuters for the end of 3-day conversations with the Japanese government in Tokyo .

`` The Germans are represented in Afghanistan relatively numerously .
However , they are stationed in areas where there is only one minimum of power and the fight requirements are not so high for them as for us in the southern and eastern part of the land , `` said gates .
The British boulevard newspaper `` Sun '' called this week the German soldiers slackers .
`` Unmasks Afghan idlers : The Germans do plays , while our boys fight , `` wrote the `` Sun '' in a contribution which was complemented with photos of German soldiers who play table tennis .

He can answer for no bloodshed , said the leader Antonio Trillanes who accused of corruption and of electoral fraud the president to reporters at the hotel .
Government loyalty soldiers had attacked the hotel before under tear gas application .
The about two dozen soldiers had entrenched since hours in the building .
Around half of them stood on Thursday because of a failed putsch attempt in 2003 in court - among them Trillanes .
He used the negotiations to retreat suddenly with about 30 sympathizers .

Approach final year-Rally aheadies to the stock exchange ? Disagreement with the experts on account of the US-mortgage crisis
With just five weeks up to the annual accounts on the stock exchange the investors already rub themselves the hands in view of the next final year-Rally .
The experts can still provide with respect to that no sure predictions .
Banif believes that rein looks statistically which walks along December on the stock exchange ordinarily with a positive market development
It is nevertheless advisable not to provide predictions at short notice and only on the basis of statistics . Above all not when tensions to be taken seriously determine the topical market events
Although other experts do not favor such a strong course increase during the last weeks of the year , these still mark that der stock market course from given liquidity of the market and the market participants is determined . These invest on account of the lack of sure stock funds primarily in pension fund which is strongly concerned by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend to to assets rich in yield .
Therefore the stock exchange will show a rather lateral course trend influenced by market fluctuations according to opinion of these experts rather , vor to all because we can not estimate yet the magnitudes of the possible decline of the interest rate of the US issuing bank , an insecurity above all on the risen crude oil price and the danger of the increase of the inflation rate is to be led back. ``
Javier Barrio , chairperson of the sales department with BPI in Spain , agrees with the fact that it is a risqué time to announce a forthcoming Markt-Rally .
Die chances do not stand very well `` , assures the expert .
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost since his Höchstmarke on the 8th November from 15,945.7 points a value of 4 % .
But not all experts divide the same negative opinion .
In view of Juan Solana , analyst with Intermoney , could conclude the Ibex 35 as a result of the restructuring of the investment fund and the traditional , every year in this time carried out Bezuschussung of the pension fund , the year successfully with nearly 16,000 points .
The expert still emphasizes that this year the things could develop a little bit differently ; above all on account of already in the second December week , and , therefore , directly after the bridge day by the day of the constitution , taking place final year-Rally .
In the opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations would not influence the market trends .
According to appraisal of Federico Olucha , analyst at bank Inversis , the present judgements are to the market position at a nearly technical level what could lead to it , dass itself soon a divergence from the index values could draw , magnitudes depended on the results of the US-mortgages market crisis .
The analyst trusts in the fact that these are positive .
With the choice of the values which should speed up the Ibex to new maxima the analysts agree .
Solana von Intermoney protests that `` dieses year the big values are in the row. ``
The expert would count two major banks and some real estate companies to the worth winners , da the stream sector at the given time will be too expensive. ``
Meanwhile Federico Olucha of bank Inversis assures that the increases walk along in connection with the bank sector and industrial sector .
If the Rally really occurs , the real estate companies will profit from her .
`` Die Automobile Club of Switzerland was during the last months on Aufholkurs and we hope that other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC smash the same way , `` thus the expert .
Concerning the raised consumer behaviour during the Christmas Day the periodical consumption will determine in the last half of the year the market events .
On the other hand , the expert believes that also the technologies achieve positive sales results , even if they are represented at the Spanish market only in low number .
Five times in seven years
During the last seven years December showed sinking course courses only in two cases .
When end of 2003 the technology bubble burst , this led the stock exchange from her crisis and initiated at the same time the real final year rally last up to now .
This year in which the Ibex 35 caught up about 28.17 percent points December a course increase of 6.68 % showed .
Whether in 2008 the fifth gainful year as a result of becomes ( the Ibex rises since January by 8.36 % ) and also an Endjahresrally can show , will appear .

These are not Warhol 's boxes
Who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box , thinks of Ikea , but not to Andy Warhol .
Or , nevertheless ?
Nowadays produced wooden boxes throw in Sweden dark shades on Warhol 's work list .
A large part 94 Brillo boxing listed there of the `` type Stockholm `` are forgeries .
After the Swedish newspaper `` Expressen '' has poked doubt about the genuineness of Andy 's Warhol Brillo boxing of 1968 some months ago , internal investigations come in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result : Six `` Brillo boxes '' which former museum manager Pontus Hultén has left the Moderna Museet in 1995 as a donation are copies - and probably also the large part about hundred other Brillo boxing of the `` type Stockholm `` which are at the international art market in circulation .
The prehistory is interlaced , a bewildering concatenation of artistic and kuratorischer productions .
In 1964 Warhol created his first `` Brillo boxes '' , painted wooden boxes which are based on the red blue-white design of the cartons of the soap powder `` Brillo '' in New York .
An exhibit of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 issued - by Warhol 's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard : These came ( for cost reasons ) not from Warhol , but were delivered directly from the Brillo board mill .
It concerned not pieces of art , but their models , around bare exhibit pieces .
At the same time Warhol has given in 1968 probably the permission to let produce some Brillo-wooden boxes in Sweden which were not issued , however , in the Moderna Museet .
Now contemporary witnesses speak of about fifteen boxes which have come `` type Stockholm `` rightly into the art and auction history at that time as an authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name .
Some of them have achieved on auctions more than 100,000 dollars .
Now the problem is that legendary museum manager Pontus Hultén has stated later falsely , about hundred wooden boxes have been produced in 1968 in Sweden and have been issued which leave Warhol to him then has .
Really Hulténs 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibit in St. Petersburg .
At that time Warhol was already dead three years .
Lars Byström , Chefkonservator in the Moderna Museet , has examined beside six Brillo boxes belonging to museum also three from Swedish private property by which two were made in 1968 in Stockholm : Their pressboard records were only undercoated and sanded down , then white oil paint with a paintbrush was applied .
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 against the fact betrays that the color with a painter 's role was applied without priming directly on the pressboard record - in addition , it concerns not oil paint , but acrylic color .
`` These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy 's Warhol Brillo boxes `` , the manager of the Moderna Museet , Lars Nittve lets announce : `` If 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board ' does not come in New York to another end , the Moderna Museet will class six boxes in his collection as copies / exhibit material. ``
Already in July , admittedly , the Authentication Board has announced to follow the `` heavy accusations `` which are raised in the matter of the soap powder boxes .
However , since that time one wraps himself there in relentless silence .

The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not become exciting with the counting up of the urns : The mass of the Russians will decide on president 's Putin party , combined Russia .
After a very bolted election campaign she confirms her striving for stability , even to Autoritarismus .
Three days before the parliamentary elections Russian president Vladimir Putin directs news emitted on the public transmitters to the voters which was already taped , indeed whose contents are kept secret , nevertheless .
He does this in his quality as a top candidate of combined Russia , the pro-Kremlin party for which an overpowering victory announces itself .
Yesterday the president let nothing look though when he received the foreign ambassadors , and was content to deliver a new attack point against the west powers which are accused of the interference favorite subject during the election campaign .
Wir know the price of a truthful democracy and expect to us honest choices , extremely transparently and openly , choices without fraudulences `` , he added .
From view of the opposition they have made a mistake there .
They prangert an election campaign stained by suppression .
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says , there would have been niemals such dirty choices , not even in the time of Eltsin `` .
After the suppression of the demonstrations on the last week-end , counts to ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder for unauthorised demonstrating by five days of custody visit ban had been condemned , according to his lawyer furthermore .
Die Russians have retained integrity the mentality of the homo Sovieticus ``
After these parliamentary elections without tension two much continuing questions set themselves up :
 Who will start Putin succession as a president ?
Yesterday the office newspaper has announced the date of the first ballot of the presidency choices , 2nd March , 2008 ; the candidates have to time 23rd December to announce themselves .
Because he was chosen in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004 , Vladimir Putin can not line up for the third mandate as a result of .
And now no successor is found .
Which role will Putin play after March ?
Prime minister ?
Chairperson of the majority in parliament and the omnipotent party combined Russia which will select government and president ?
Whatever it will be , by the parliament choices or by the presidency choices , the present power will triumph .
This is a tradition .
Die Russians have retained integrity the mentality of the homo Sovieticus , they are not man of her destiny `` , thinks sociologist Lev Goudkov , manager of the independent center Levada .
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the state university of Saint Petersburg goes back even even further : The middle-class society has only very slowly developed in this land which became five centuries after Europe christianisiert ; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality .
After the liberal reforms of the 90s Putin has gone back to the model of a paternalistischen state again what was completely accepted by the population , the more , because no terror followed this new Paternalismus , but a certain economic prosperity , means Maria Lipman of the Carnegie endowment .
Today verzichten `` the Russians aus to free pieces on the personal responsibility `` which they have displayed after the decay of the USSR for a short time .
Wozu still consider long ? ``
This phenomenon concerns all social classes , including the business world .
And the administrative élite knows how to hold the status Quo : 65 governors ( from 85 Russian region chairpersons ) state the local electoral lists of combined Russia .
The new freedoms coming from the west are often synonymous with chaos , how in the 90s .
The general public prefers stability .
In this sense the Russians will also not be right for the extremist parties .
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko , a 54-year-old professor : Wozu still consider long ?
Those which are in power are not so bad , why they remove ? ``

New fears about natural gas quarrel between Russia and the Ukraine
A new prize quarrel smolders between the Ukraine and Russia what raises the danger that Russian exports are impaired by fuel to Western Europe .
The biggest part of the Russian natural gas exports in the European Union ( EU ) is escorted through the Ukraine and every quarrel between both nations is very exactly observed .
Kiev has warned about the fact that if Moscow raises the price which it must pay for the natural gas , it will charge for higher transit fees of Russia .
An earlier conflict between both states last year diminished deliveries in the EU states .
The latest quarrel between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time to which the Ukrainian government and the Russian , state gas monopoly Gazprom try to reach an arrangement on how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008 .
According to Gazprom must be calculated to the Ukraine more , because the group has agreed to pay up to 50 % , in addition , for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan .
Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine must pay 40 % more for the imports of Gazprom .
`` It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversations `` , the Minister for Economic Affairs of the Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency said Reuters .
`` The changing natural gas prices should be connected certainly with our arguments with regard to the height of the transit fees [ to Western Europe ] over the Ukraine. ``
In the last big natural gas quarrel between Moscow and Kiev in January , 2006 Gazprom shortened deliveries in the Ukraine .
This led as a result of to a case of the exports to Western Europe what forced up the prices drastically .
Russian gas puts out a quarter of the care of the European Union .
Russia has the worldwide biggest gas occurence , but a lot of it remains underdeveloped .
The result is that Gazprom complements his own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations .

Eleven Staaten-darunter commissioned with their management Germany , France , Israel and them has agreed in May , 2006 to make them for researchers and historians accessible .
After the ratification process of this decision was concluded , the opening is valid since yesterday .
Awkward information
The access of the historians to bath Arolsen will enable to pursue investigations , vor to all about the deportations of prisoners , the passengers of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers `` , explains Reto to masters , leader of these archives who are administered by the international committee of the Red Cross ( CICR ) .
Up to short several states , under it also Germany against it , these name-related documents for the general public were still to be made accessible , on account of the awkward character of certain information .
As for example the supposed homosexuality or the spiritual impediment of some deportation victims .
The passenger 's lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for practical reason : The civilians who had deported or had been subordinated the hard labor , to find , and to deliver to them , perhaps , an evidence of her arrest to flatten the way for her compensation to them thus .
Still today more than 300 festival employees work on in bath Arolsen ten thousands of personal inquiries .
Still , a part of the scientific community shows only one restricted interest in the access to bath Arolsen .
Man may expect nothing basically new in these documents `` , had Pr . Wolfgang Benz , leader of the research center for anti-Semitism of the technological university of Berlin , in 2006 explains .

Court lowers punishments for detectives who were formed an alliance with Berdych
The former policeman Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík which are accused to have done common thing with the volumes of David Berdych received 13 or 10 years of custody .
This decided in a legal judgment the Prager higher regional court which reduced , besides , her punishment around one or about two years .
Originally 14 or 12 years threatened the detectives of the `` office for the fight against the organized crime `` .
Against the today 's judgment there is no appeal possibility , only check at the uppermost court is possible .
Indeed , Berdych itself is also accused in this thing , however , the erstinstanzliche judgment approaches to him at first .
Nevertheless , with other processes he had already received punishments from a total of 16 years .
To any more he can not be condemned .
A municipal court spoke in January , 19 persons above all because of participation in raids guilty , today the higher regional court negotiated the appeal of 16 of them .
Most culprits denied from the outset the accusation with the grounds , it concerns a contrived case .
According to the mittelböhmischen municipal court members of the police in arrangement , among the rest , with Berdych to criminals handed over information from springs of the police , covered different raids and helped members of the volumes to avoid the criminal proceedings .
Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey left the volumes for it .
With the accusation it is about criminal offenses of the volumes from 1999 till 2001 .
In particular around the raids whose victims often suffered heavy injuries , but also around usurpation and unauthorised weapon possession .
By house searches the police discovered since unlawful guns , ammunition with steel core , a laser sight telescope and a submachine gun .
The volumes has got rich according to the accusation by her raids about many million crowns .
Except beihnahe 20 men in this procedure to recognized courts Berdych and a row more different because of other raids legally than guilty .
Other men from Berdychs vicinity must justify themselves in another process , other cases have not reached yet before the court .
Of the main negotiations are up to now Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej which are in Irish custody and wait for the final decision on her delivery for the purpose of criminal proceedings in Czech Republic , escaped .

Pains of the Labour party
Gordon Brown has discovered still an other pit to the Hineinfallen ; his way from this remains the same .
For British scandals this is not especially slippery .
No titles of nobility seem to have been sucked sold , politician 's Paris hotel calculations paid-uply , no illegitimate toes .
But the disclosure that a rich businessman has veiled donations for the British ruling Labour party about more than 650,000 pounds ( 1.3 million dollars ) more than four years under the name of other people , and that the party has failed to announce this is something without the fought Gordon Brown would have well got by .
When two months ago the Prime Minister had avoided the demand for a choice , in stupid way the intelligence of the Britons insulting , while he stated that opinion polls had not influenced this decision there was hope that he would offer a robust , efficient government .
Instead , like Vince Cable who expressed keen representation chairperson of the Liberally democrats , it in increasing litre of beer the once dreaded Brown of Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean .
The clumsy rescue of Northern rock , a groggy bank , showed regulatorische weakness and bad judgment property under bombardment .
Badly thought-out suggestions for the change of the tax laws have raised enterprise federations against the government .
The tax-official loss of personal data of 25 million people indicated inconceivable administrative botch-ups .
A trio of generals in the retirement started to an uprising in the Upper House in protest against shortenings of military expenses : To be a minister of the armed forces , they stated , is a part-time job .
Now there are the varied donations of David Abrahams ; Peter Watt , Labours secretary general ( and her earlier fulfilment leader ) has already withdrawn .
Nothing means of the fact that Brown opens definitely in the direction of exit .
Governments can still reach a turning point , after they it feel impossibly to rule .
Neither may trust nor people to politicians , hold back , however , them ordinarily her scepticism if a new troop seizes the office .
If it is clear once that it is unlikely that a prime minister improves the situation , and he does not need to be present yet long , this deferment is over : the civil service starts to become leaking ; the cabinet ministers start to chat ; the press looks for bad news ; and the government becomes defensive and aimless .
In a way the position of Brown is especially difficult because it can not claim in contrast to other political leaders to be a new broom .
So with pleasure he would deny Tony Blair , he was his first lieutenant .
The problems with Northern to rock and the tax competence documents , for example , hang together with decisions which Brown met as a chancellor of the Ministry of Finance .
And even if was involved not directly in Blair 's bad luck - as with the long `` money for title of nobility `` investigation of political party financing - the voters possibly assume from the fact that he was it .
Nevertheless , Browns position is not so bad completely as it looks
The misdemeanours are not so awful as the conservatives describe them .
As with Mr. Bean , nobody has died , or was totally swindled out .
And the antidote , painfully how it may be is to be delivered what Browns have always promised of course Stalinist trends : A reliable , respectable and slightly crude government .
The new fuss around political donations is a good example .
Garboeske Abrahams which compares his donations to his charitable gifts says he wishes no public recognition for his goodwill .
This may be maybe like that , but the decision on it was not entitled to him .
The laws against anonymity for big political contribution payers are clear and they exist for unequivocal reason : the general public has a right on to know who can buy itself access to those which govern the land .
Watts , that says he would have known about Abrahams arrangement , but not that she is unlawful , will have to position itself naturally of some questions ; exactly like Jon Mendlesohn , Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber whom about the odd donations was told in October .
However , up to now Brown is not involved : There is nothing that points to the fact that he knew about this confusion , although the biggest part of the payments was done after his office takeover in June .
Up to now the prime minister has done half of the work .
He has condemned fast the injury of the laws by his party , but he diluted this determination by the griffins after a known instrument , has led to an investigating committee on the subject - to fill the measure , from a bishop in the retirement and a judge .
In this case the `` apprenticeships to be pulled from it `` are not complicated very much .
If the law was broken , it is a thing for the police .
Apart from the fact there are other things Mr. Brown must do to find how a little bit one permanent chairpersons for the independent committee for standards in the public life which is unoccupied since six months and to progress with a drastic reform of political party financing .
This would require from the hard liners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and to give up , perhaps , the special financial respect with the trade unions - the bitter pills for a party member like Mr. Brown .
But he should be aware of some biased facts .
Now the conservatives have a clear guidance in the opinion polls ; he has to win back two years around voters ; and the only way , as he can reach a victory , is by indisputable righteousness and respectable competence .

In the empire of Angela Wolke
The unrealistic appearance of the chancellor documents that the coalition is as regards content at the end - and that from herself nothing more is to be expected .
In which land does this Federal Chancellor live , actually ?
After her hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag which wurschtig and was poor in contents one must say : not here - not in the land which would have to be governed by her , finally .
Angela Merkel with a badly haughty sentence has rejected the reproach that it concentrates too much upon the foreign affairs .
This is provincial , she said and showed with it only that she does not want to understand what it is for the critics about .
In the Bundestag she has documented for everything recognizably , how much their reproach applies .
There neither concrete interest nor even a feeling was to be felt for the problems in the land .
Instead , Angela Wolke presented herself : a removed politician who flees in the foreign affairs and remains even there in the approximate .
Example climate protection : There she praises herself without braking for the decisions of saint 's dam , however , does not say how in this country the climate purposes should be reached .
Generally , the selfpraise - so much presumptuousness would have denied itself the CDP boss still two years ago .
Now she clings to the empty phrase that the impetus comes with the people .
With it she damages her image as the pragmatist who solves problems instead of the world schönzureden .
But in the empire of Angela Wolke domestic problems are a secondary phenomenon .
Child poverty and the worries of the low breadwinners ?
She has a few subordinate clauses for it , for the rest .
Besides , it is typical , how often she makes a slip when it is about the children 's allowance .
Merkel needs three approaches there to bring out a more or less straight sentence .
She trips like on foreign terrain if it becomes concrete .

Which assurance is suited for me best of all ?
The KFZ assurance which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver contain a high expense whose height takes down rerum on different factors , among other things from age , gender , time of the production of the driving licence , marital status , kind of the car to be insured and his use , etc .
A car is to be owned only the beginning .
Since the suitable KFZ assurance is to be found even difficult as the right vehicle model .
At first once must be clear to one with which we have to do it here .
A car insurance is an arrangement between an insurance society and a policy holder .
This arrangement is held on in writing by means of a contract of insurance which fixes that the society receives the arranged insurance premium and is obliged as a countermove to present the suitable sum of indemnity with a case of damage .
The insurance premium is the price of an assurance which consists by several factors , among other things age , gender , time of the production of the driving licence , marital status , kind of the vehicle to be insured or his use .
The insurance enterprises settle her prices accordingly of the statistics , so that with a higher accident danger also higher contribution payments become due .
That 's why less contribution payments must perform about 25-year-old as well as women , because statistics prove that these groups show a lower accident rate thanks to her care .
The same also counts to married persons , because these incline after statement of the statistical values and , therefore , also after conviction of the enterprises , to less accidents like single .
The use which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and with it also the likelyhood of an accident .
The more often the use , the more probably the damage .
By the installation of the premium the assurances must take into consideration a whole row of points .
That 's why the driver must also study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance which meets his personal needs in the earliest one .
We list at this point now the most important points which one should consider with the choice of an assurance to be able to meet not only an achievement , but also a choice oriented to price .
Among 25-year-old hit with a choice of an inexpensive assurance on numerous obstacles , as for example the low driving practise and junge `` driving licence .
Even if it was the best for an ideal insurance cover to conclude a full fully comprehensive insurance , there are still less expensive alternatives .
The careful drivers can select a Vollkasko with deduction , so that the achievements of a full fully comprehensive insurance are covered , indeed , but are offered for a low price .
Of such type from contract contain that the customer must pay a part of the amount resulted by the damage himself .
`` Der amount is fixed before end of the contract and with the help of the height of the insurance premium . This is higher the more slightly the sum to be paid `` , explains Luis Noguera , general agent of Spain with ridge Europe , to a mediation enterprise for on-line assurances .
Another option is the enlarged assurance which insures of the customer against external accident damages , not , nevertheless , against the damages resulted in own car .
In addition , theft , fire and vehicle loss would cover of such type of the assurance .
Here a council .
If you are 25 years old under , it lies in your hand to lower the insurance costs ; thus your credit increases , while you try to go carefully and to avoid accidents .
A credit is a lowering of the base rate at the suitable insurance society .
On the contrary in addition contain a penal payment an increase of aforesaid rate .
`` Die height credits and penal payments depend on the society and their yields .
If the enterprise has a year rich in yield behind itself , it can allow itself to raise the bonus payments `` , explains Noguera .
As soon as the 25-annual brand is crossed , it is to be concluded for the drivers more simply a contract . Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practise the accident rate sinks .
Therefore it is the most sensible to decide on a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction .
`` Normalerweise can pull the youngsters no use from her present experience , in case of an accident as well as at the time of the driving `` , does not explain the Spanish director of the European enterprise , and adds that the majority of the accidents occur in the second practise year , after Angst of the beginner `` was filed .
Still it is with a married customer who owns no children to conclude more advisable , a full fully comprehensive insurance ; of course only if it also admits the financial situation of the suitable person .
On the part of the insurers married couples with children count as the customers with the slightest accident rate , and accordingly low her contribution payments also fall out .
In this case a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction ( with an amount about the 300 euros ) would be the best option . In the case that one has received a high credit , an enlarged assurance which starts only to the third vehicle year is recommended .
`` Sie go all together more relaxed and own a bigger purchasing power which allows to them to attach a higher contribution payment `` , ascertains Luis Noguera .
For pensioners it is obvious to conclude a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction ( with an amount about the 150 euros ) , or an enlarged assurance which starts only with an enough high credit .
At last one must stick that the car insurance is something very important , not only because she protects the driver against possible accident damages , but also because she rescues high costs which require that a thorough choice is dripped which corresponds to our personal situation .

Today for the fact that she has given a name to a teddy bear it was brought forward to a court in Khartum .
According to information of her lawyer the British teacher who had been accused in Sudan of insults of Islam was condemned on the Thursday evening by a court in Khartum by 15 days of custody and next expulsion .
The Briton was accused to have permitted 6 to seven-year-old pupils , to give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear , although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited .
She would have earned to be whipped .
After parents of pupils had complained several times with the Sudanese Ministry of Education and the Arts , the 54-year-old basic schoolteacher who was active in the Unity High School of Khartum on Sunday was taken up with herself at home and was accused according to the article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of the insults of Islam .
Really this affair takes her beginning in September when the teacher asks theirs 6 to seven-year-old pupil to select a name for the Klassenteddy .
Die children suggest eight names , under it Hassan , Abdullah and Mohammed `` , reports headmaster Robert Boules .
In the end when the class votes , 20 of 23 children Mohammed choose as the dearest given name .
Absolutely , Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet , but above all also a given name very frequent in Sudan .
Afterwards the children have provided a book for the class , with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature `` Mein name is Mohammed `` .
The bear itself carried no sign with this name , but the problem is quite easy that the representation of the Islamic prophet is looked as insults of Islam .
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian Gibbons who informs at the same school in Sudan explained , he knows them well , and she would never have something would have acted with which she could step to a religious belief too near , `` ich regrets only that she has asked the children to be right for a name , on this occasion ,  , his opinion it concerns only a `` unschuldigen mistake `` .
An opinion which numerous pupils of the teacher divide who speaks this as `` sehr carefully towards her pupils `` and as `` Person , never in the class about religion `` describe .
One thinks that the given name Mohammed is at the same time also in Great Britain in the second most frequent given second name for which into English 14 different manners of writing exist .
This often from Moslem families well-chosen given name counts as a kind of deference to the prophet ( he is often given to the first-born of a family ) .
But how are the rules concerning the use of this given name ?
May one give him , for instance , to toys ?
This is naturally a question of the interpretation .

Small Saarland , good education
The smallest federal state is leading with the professional training and shines even with the international adjustment of his colleges .
Only in an educational field the same deficit presses the Saarlanders like the rest of the land .
`` Yesterday I have explained to the 50-th time to a non-Saarlander that we are no French `` - the smallest federal state placards this slogan self-ironic to his 50-th birthday .
Besides , France and Luxembourg play a big role in the education system of Saarland which lies in the educational monitor of the institute of the German economy Cologne ( IW ) on place five .
Thus the colleges already cooperate from tradition narrowly with the neighboring countries .
The university in Saarbrucken was founded in 1948 by the French .
Till this day students can conclude here her study with a double or even triple certificate .
The interest of foreign students with 15.6 percent is accordingly high .
However , also the natives Saarland brings in above-average number to the colleges - many of them without end in the high school .
`` In Saarland one uses the professional education system `` , says Axel Plünnecke , educational expert with the IW .
More than every fifth youngster his study authorization acquires in a vocational school , with it Saarland lies more than seven percent points about the federal average .
Also the possible combinations of professional and academic education are developed relatively strongly .
Measured in the population figures the equipment with binary study ways second-best is in Germany .
In spite of the practically oriented education and rising inquiry the number of the engineer 's graduates has sunk during the past years , nevertheless , by a third .
This is why the Saarland ministry of education has obliged the colleges now to a marketing campaign for engineer-scientific fields .
`` At the general schools we have stumbled according to the first Pisa study several reforms `` , says a speaker of the ministry of education .
Thus the government introduced national comparative tests .
So that to learn to start the children earlier the last Kita year is toll-free - a model which , in the meantime , also other federal states copy .
Whether the achievements of the pupils improve with lasting effect , only future comparative studies will point .
Near Pisa in 2003 shrank the interest of the risk pupils from 29 to 20 percent .
Nevertheless , all together Saarland increased not so strongly as other federal states .
The Bavarians better count .
And to the frustration of the Saarlanders Fremdsprachenkenntnise are not measured near Pisa - otherwise , in this area one could score .
Since the language of the neighbors is a duty in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are no French .

Auchan most expensive , Tesco raises by almost one fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser commercial area have also maintained of this year the average price increase of 16 % of the last year , with the difference that there was no rise of the value added tax of this year .
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser commercial triangle the price of the usual Christmas basket of the `` Napi '' has also increased of this year about 16 percent , indeed , price increases were registered in all hypermarkets by more than 1,000 HOOFS .
After the prices are in the food markets in the last December `` davongaloppiert '' , the price increase prozentuell has been not drastic , compared to the anyway high , earlier source level .
Indeed , it looks deterrent on the consumers certainly that that for what they had paid last year still far less than 9,000 HOOFS this year is not even available for 10,000 HOOFS .
The price of the `` Napi '' of goods basket crossed the magic 10,000-hoof border about at least 91 HOOFS in the examined markets .
The highest price amounted to 10.573 HOOFS .
( In 6800 the price lay with 6,800 HOOFS . )
The prices of Unicum and living fish remained nearly at year before level , have strongly risen , however , the prices of turkeys breast fillets , nut and poppy .
Prices of flour and bread corresponded to the data of the central statistical office of Hungary , nevertheless , with Auchan there was 1 kg of bread reveille for 139 Forint .
There was no competitive-conditioned steep fall in prices on less than 200 Forint with the product .
The price of two liters of Coca Cola security bottle of less than 200 Forint was likewise astonishing here , therefore the drink cost including security only 257 HOOFS .
Still cut of this year in the `` Napi '' goods basket-comparison Auchan most expensive , and Cora most for a good price from .
Our calculations have proved , that Cora the prices in the `` Napi '' goods basket compared with the Christmas prices last year around 15 , while Tesco and Auchan have raised in each case by 18 percent .
The difference between the cheapest goods basket of the year before and the most expensive one of the wine bar year amounted to 12 % , while the rise put out 21 % between the cheapest goods basket of the last year and most expensive of the current year .
The average rise in prices amounted to 1,480.00 HOOF .
The average price increase lay in the year before still with 1,206.00 Forint , indeed , the value added tax rise became apparent with the prices to the last Christmas .
Exactly this process has dripped trade badly : Apparently the department stores could not decide so surely which prize span they should apply with the single articles , because the consequences of the price increase on the consumer behaviour were unpredictable .
( If the trader plans the orbiting speed of a product badly , he can fall around essential profits in the prize span which is directed after the traffic intensity . )
Mehwertsteuer-bedingt the price increase of the `` Napi '' of goods basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket crossed the value of 2006 about 1720 Forint , while the difference between prices amounted only to 844 Forint with the cheapest basket .
Of this year such extremes were not observed , because the most expensive basket cost about 1,630.00 Forint more than in the year before , and even with the cheapest one there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00 Forint .
In the comparison of both last Christmas seasons a catastrophic price increase appeared , the price of the everyday consumption articles in the hypermarkets has risen in less than 20 months by more than 30 percent .
( This confirms not necessarily the data of the central statistical office of Hungary again : With some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months ascertained a more than 30-percent price increase .
So in possibly beside flour also with eggs . )
If one throws , nevertheless , a look in the `` Napi '' to goods basket , this seems impossible with latter nearly , because the prize level of the product already expensive in the year before has risen even in the worst case about barely more than 10 percent .
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - at least , could shift them the drastic price increase on the multinationals .
In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not complain ; It is reported constantly from good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers does not look in three department stores at all at the prices .
It are bought from all large amount , long-lasting food goes to palettes above the counters .
There was Wednesday vormittag in all three department stores endless queues with the Kassa when suddenly the number of the customers exploded .
Indeed , a lower customer frequency is reported about the land , so that many multinationals complain with the pollsters , they could not even reach the planned turnover , namely not only with food , but also with lasting consumer goods .

Popular will have opened his 200 loan institutes from on Mondays to 12 hours on Fridays during the day .
Popular has decided to modernize a big part of his branches .
A total of 200 of it are settled in the economic-strongest regions of Spain .
For the institute which operates Max under the trade name Popular these establishments signify a big landmark .
But also dares for the remaining Spanish institutes , because Popular as the first bank group shows the jump to extend the opening times of his branches weekdays to 20.30h and to begin on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h .
The bank group BBVA , likewise the lengthening of her opening times in the establishments repeatedly are reported read , has caught up to now still no definitive decision .
The negotiations running at the moment of the bank with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an arrangement with which 75 % of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for it on a weekday in the afternoon , even if not for the clientele .
Whether other banks of the new initiative join which adapts itself to the commercial opening times , bank will depend on the values of experience of the Popular .
And just this is also the intention which pursues Popular with her project .
Purpose is to extend the opening times of those branches which can grasp the purchase-amusing clientele of independent , small and medium constant enterprises , but also those of big department stores on account of her position .
The bank would like to open new 200 branch places in the course of the coming 18 months , because it concerns not new , but changed opening times .
For it the bank will reshape the rooms of those establishments which are already in commercial zones , and they adapt at the same time to the individual customer profile of the different zones .
Thus the extension of the opening times is connected with a new spatial arrangement of the branches which distinguishes itself by a more topical , more colorful design .
The responsible bank representative Á ngel Rivera assures that the restructuring requires no bigger investments , but with a raised personnel setting would walk along , because a branch needed now no more six , but eight or nine employees .
The establishments which will be equipped even with additional rooms for the KMU will sell no financial products .
A positive experience for the group
Popular has tested his draft already in nine branches in Madrid .
And the values of experience were positive , thus Á ngel Rivero .
The establishments of the streets Bravo ! Murillo , O'Donell and the grain Vía have been selected for what a clever decision seems to have been .
Popular leads at the moment approx . 2500 establishments .
And other 60 which operate under the name Mundocredit . These are specified on immigrant and show likewise enlarged opening times , even on Sundays and holidays .
In these branches of PopularMax the model of the BBVA is not used , because most from them , instead , a wide choice will offer in not-finance services to the sales .
`` Wir would like to show for our customers no competition `` , explains Rivero .
With Telefonica they have come provisionally to the arrangement to sell mobile phones help of external bank staff .

Spectacular repair in the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his companions of the occupying of the international space station ( eat ) more than seven hours will have used in the space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific works on the station .
A risqué climbing out which has achieved on account of his duration , the distance of inhabitable modules , the quickness with which he was organized and to carry out which from the astronauts gebastelten `` tools , in order the repair several records .
The problem appeared on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery , a big cylinder-shaped part which should soon take up the European and Japanese scientific labs .
This module is a kind of landing stage for the module labs .
But one must be able to supply them with stream .
It was the second task of the occupying , a 17.5 metric tons module to the stream production about solar collectors which was already on the International Space Station , to move to bring it in his final position .
After she had moved it , the occupying came along to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module whose span amounts to 76 meters .
And , besides , it happened that one of the collectors which can be opened up like Akkordeone was damaged by a stuck cable on a length by chance to a meter
The restructuring was stopped not to damage the collector even more .
The astronauts who leave originally for a controlling way the space shuttle Discovery and then another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty should repair , felt constrained to devote itself to the damaged collector .
And Scott Parazynski was selected , at the end of the 30 meter long remote control arm of the space shuttle which had been attached in that of the station , to walk to carry out the repair .
He is one best Spacewalker `` ( Wetraumgänger ) of the NASA .
Largely , resistantly , very much skillful , he has a well developed upper part of the body and long arms .
The 46-jähirige qualified doctor was selected , verletzten `` solar collector to operieren `` .
After he had exactly examined the damages , he split the faulty cable and fastened a kind of rails on the damaged place .
He was supported from second Spacewalker `` which remained near the sluice , and , from inside , by the other astronauts , among them Peggy Whitson , commander of the occupying .
The tools which he used a mini-hockey stick , in insulator wraps to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors which generate several hundred volts , the astronauts had thought up aboard the station and gebastelt `` .
When the action was finished , Scott Parazynski waited , until the collector was opened up completely , before he counted his tools and returned in the station .
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts half a day of relaxation enjoyed , before today seven astronauts on the space shuttle Discovery returned to start the return flight to the earth probably Wednesday .

From Beust criticism harvests for Olympia-Absage
Moving away the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic summer plays has bumped with policy and economy into violent criticism .
Many further want to fight for the plays in the water .
However , from Beust realism sends a reminder by the appraisal of the chances .
The general manager of the chamber of commerce of Hamburg , Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz , called on Wednesday a renunciation as `` not well for the economic location `` .
No other project has recently unfolded so big motivation forces in the town like the Olympic idea .
`` Without this purpose the sports-political swing would not be able to be maintained in the same litre of beer. ``
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project , but to find for it a new long-term beginning , `` that goes out from a changed time ray `` .
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements after which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic at least up to 2028 .
`` Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application , but the German Olympic sports alliance `` , said from Beust WELT online .
He referred to the decision expected for beginning of December of the sports alliance about an application of Munich for the Winter Olympics in 2018 .
`` This preference means for us that we will have no realistic chances in the period angedachten up to now from us till 2028. ``
The dream is not still for all time ausgeträumt , said from Beust .
The Hamburg sports alliance ( HSB ) regretted the statements of Beusts .
The impression is thereby woken that Hamburg wants to apply during the next 25 years no more for Olympic games .
`` It is too early to obstruct a chance to themselves , while one buries the plans already at that time `` , said HSB president Günter Ploss on Wednesday .
Besides , a renunciation of the application stands in the contradiction to the statement of the senate boss on the occasion of a receipt to the plenary assembly of the general German university sport federation .
There the application of Hamburg has not called from Beust for the Universiade in 2015 `` substitute `` with Olympic games in Hamburg .
The university sport federation had nominated only last week Hamburg as an applicant 's town .
The SPD-citizens faction accused the senate of not having used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg .
`` For years the development of the small Grasbrooks has been delayed by the senate because he has placed on the map Olympia and has ignored the house building `` , said SPD-delegated Carola Veit and Jan Quast .
While SPD has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residential use for the small Grasbrook , the CDP has placed unilaterally on the `` event factor '' .
The application for the Olympic summer plays in 2012 had released in Hamburg at that time a big enthusiasm .
However , Hamburg had failed because of Leipzig .

Fodor and six Hungarian percent
As minister of the environment Gábor Fodor announced , the expert 's meetings come to an end on Tuesday , and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening .
Experts and politicians from 192 lands consult on the timetable of Bali in which the issue-reducing measures are fixed for the time after 2012 , thus at the end of the Kyoto protocol .
Nowadays a violent debate is between industrial lands and developing countries going .
The USA have already signaled that they do not want to negotiate about concrete figures , indeed , they be would ready to reduce the greenhouse gas issues in comparison to 1990 about 25-40 percent till 2020 .
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrial states are ready to support the developing countries financially , as well as beside the reduction of the issues technological .
An agreement about the support was also achieved by developing countries .
The adaptation fund subordinated to the Kyoto protocol should be administered by a 16-headed council , probably with the global Umweltfazilität ( GEF ) of UN , how in the `` Piac és profit `` is to be read up .
Six percent of Hungary
Minister of the environment Gábor Fodor supports in the name of Hungary the attempt of the EU to maintain her forerunner role with global climate protection measures , and to achieve a new international agreement till 2009 .
The minister explained , the EU will reduce the greenhouse gas issues about 20 % till 2020 ( measured in the values of 1990 ) , no matter whether the `` agreement is achieved after 2012 `` successfully , or not . The union be would even ready to exert itself for a 30-percent reduction , soferne other big industrial states of the world , or developing countries are likewise ready to follow to her obligations after forces and responsibly .
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states which had joined in 1997 to the Kyoto protocol was a reduction of only 5.2 percent , while the EU with her 15 member states at that time had already committed itself to a deficit of 8 % .
The default for Hungary is reduction of the greenhouse gas issues about 6 % in comparison to 1985-87 - a default which will fulfil the land absolutely as in the press release of the ministry of the environment is to be read up .
The application is high on Bali - at least , the long-term international climate-political agreement must be ready within two years , otherwise it would come into force with certainty only after 2012 . In this case no renewed , international issue reduction system would follow the reduction plans agreed in the Kyoto protocol whose meaning has also emphasized the IPCC , the international scientific climate change-committee excellent with the peace Nobel prize of UN in his latest report .
The issue reduction would be thereby delayed , and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2°C would be inevitable what would entail extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to scientists .

Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi : Voruteile dwindle
To say the truth , I never was a special fan of Peugeot 206 .
His handling characteristics were not a lot worth , one could call the quality of the way circuit , the steering system and also the processing rather subnormal .
However , now is his successor , Peugeot 207 , at the market , and he is better around a lot .
The station-wagon with the name SW is other one more piece , and to me remains only to revise my opinion .
When I had tested the classical Hatchback of 207 , I had to complain , for example , of the too low head room on the Hintersitzen .
There is this discomfort now no more , because the bodywork of the station-wagon is so formed that Zweimetermänner will not even suffer .
Quick further
I go through the interior equipment only briefly not to recur too much .
It concerns a rather successful design where I have objections only because of the miserable middle tunnel .
There I would greet a little bit more designerische creation where the car does , otherwise , such an elegant impression .
The seats are comfortable , and past are the times where we complained , perhaps , to too short seats or headrests .
Also the side hold has substantially improved compared with 206 .
What concerns the space offer , one can also feel here the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork .
In the station-wagon the already mentioned lack of head room is also removed .
Suitcase in the boot
However , the central issue in this car is the loading bay .
I must call him ( also because of the openable back window ) very well loadable and space-saving .
The hollow cavities are equipped with hold belts which show an ideal compromise .
They do not interfere , can be pulled apart and also hold on heavier objects .
However , we talk about the loading volume .
It amounts according to table in the basic equipment to 428 liters what is a rather average value in comparison to competition .
Indeed , not in comparison to vehicle bestselling in Czechia of this class , the Škoda Fabia Combi .
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav , we find out that Peugeot stays behind about clearly perceptible 52 liters .
For a foreign vacation or with the invitation of a baby carriage this value is already critical .
But to emphasize around the Positiva , I must still mention on folding down the back seats quite level loading bay or also the very low loading edge .
120 HP in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four coil petrol engine with cubic capacity 1.6 liters and an achievement of 88 kW .
And honestly said , so a 1600Kubik engine should look which drives a Familien-Hatchback .
He is quiet , has a low consumption and moves well .
If I compare him to his counterpart in Škoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust with a cloth was blocked , then I can be only inspired by him .
The price-list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not quite popular .
However , we must remember that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine .
The base price of the car with the 1400th petrol engine at the rate of 329,900 crowns still begins .
With our engine it costs from 410,900 crowns what is already quite a lot .
The equipment premium of the test car hits once again with 80,000 crowns in addition to beech .
However , we had head air bags , automatic air-conditioning , automatic windshield wiper release , electric window lifters behind and and ...
Thus the car costs all together settles 531,900 crowns .
This is an amount , but you add up once the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will come with a quite similar sum .
Thus only the decision remains which brand one wants to choose .

On Wednesday it came with the last negotiations meeting in Vienna to no arrangement on the future status of the province .
At the end the miss
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo have finished Wednesday morning in Baden , Austria , the sixth and last discussion meeting without being able to overcome her controversies about the future status of the separatistischen province .
Es it is unfortunate that the parties could come to no arrangement on the status `` , explained the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger with a press conference in Vienna .
With stress on the fact that the peace is at stake in the region his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrad and Pristina asked to follow to her obligations to the preservation of the peace , and to continue the conversations also after the end of the negotiations .
Es are expected no acts of violence in immediate future , but we stand at the beginning of a very difficult time `` , he added and indicated that there are absolutely clear tensions .
End of the mediation on the 10th December
The mediators of the Troika which unites the European Union , the USA and Russia in itself will meet on Monday the last time in Serbia and in Kosovo .
The future to 90 % of in Albanian speaking inhabited province could become clearer if Ischinger , Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit her report to the UN Security Council up to the 10th December .
The conversations of Baden , close to Vienna , formed the sixth and last negotiations meeting since the Troika the last August of UN the order to a new mediation had received .
Americans and Europeans calculate on the fact that her mediation order will end on the 10th December .
The Russians who had already blocked the approval of the independence of Kosovo at the security council exist on a continuation of the negotiations after this final date .
Russland was and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution , a concerted solution `` , said Botsane-Khartchenko .
one-sided declaration of independence ?
After Kosovo has stood during eight years under management of UN , the western lands hold the independence under supervision by the EU for the only solution with future .
Pristina is ready to announce unilaterally this if the security council should not decide in their favours .
Belgrade exists on stronger autonomy
Bedauerlicherweise it could be dripped no arrangement `` , the president announced to the autonomous authority of Kosovo , Fatmir Sejdiu , at the hotel in Baden where since Monday these were led Verhandlungen of the last chance `` .
Hashim Thaci , former leader of the kosovarischen rebellion and future prime ministers of the province divided his regret .
Nevertheless , he added that the plan suggested by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of einer past which has led to murder and deportations `` .
Domino effect ``
Serbian president Boris Tradic was on his part of the opinion that a compromise is to be aimed always , and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo about the consequences of a one-sided declaration of independence of the province .
Belgrade thinks , that it especially a `` snowball effect '' in a region fürchet which is still weakened so much by the independence wars of the 90s .
Für Serbia does not mean this that a compromise would be impossible `` , he said .
On Tuesday the Serbian delegation had insisted on the fact that any decision is dripped solely solely in the security council where of their Russian allies a veto power holds .
Das parliament of Kosovo will have the last word ``
Nur a decision from the rows of the security council is for Serbia satisfactory `` , explained Serbian prime minister Vojislav Kostunica .
Diese negotiations have lasted two years .
They must end in such a way as they have begun : in the security council. ``
Fatmir Sejdiu answered the journalist that das parliament of Kosovo has the last word with regard to the status `` , and added that every one-sided declaration of independence of sides of the in Albanian speaking population in vote `` with the western lands will run off .

Political Capital : Hungarian guard raises state risk
In the opinion of the department for risk analysis ( Risk Analysing division ) from Political Capital the activities in this August with support of the `` movement for better Hungary have raised `` founded Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard .
Among the rest , in the `` risk warning-report '' of the institute one says : In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk shows the `` increase of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gipsy and not-Gipsy 's population in Hungary which could lead even at short notice to violent ethnic discussions `` .
Principal reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which is presumably aimed at the provocation of such a discussion , according to the research institute .
As reported , this is looked as an omission by sides of the politically persons responsible : `` Persons of the public life have the discussion Roma-Frage Vertretern more radically of political groupings leave which have built up now her political strategy on the Roma Hungary contrast `` .
One supposes that aggravate this the problem , the reasonable dialog make impossible , extremities favor above others , as well as would raise the likelyhood of violent discussions .
In addition , the Forschungsinsitut means which would have activities of the Hungarian guard , not least thanks to the huge attention of sides of the home and foreign media , `` the picture of Hungary abroad considerably injured , in particular what the trust concerns in the stability and democratic maturity `` .
We remember : Since autumn , 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups is in Hungary continuously in the impetus , so that since summer , 2007 several , `` national self-defense association `` calling organizations were founded themselves .
`` To these groupings is common that they define themselves in each case as a civil organization , while they boast openly of it , her members on - every now and then armed - to prepare defensive tasks ( emergency services , national defense , Ordnungshütung ) , with reference to the unsuitability of the police , the army , or the state even `` , called it .
And further : All that happens according to that method which tries to camouflage different , on the policy and party sullenness of the population based , political attempts as a middle-class initiative .
The stress of the civil character and the association form do not serve only the avoidance of juridical hurdles which could appear in the course of the registration at court - it is at the same time a political strategy .
How of the analysis is to be taken , the activities of the Hungarian guard show a risikoerhöhenden factor also for the relations with the neighbouring states .
`` During the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighbouring states as a potential danger spring , quite a lot of of the ultranationalistic politicians of certain neighboring countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own Anti Hungary policy .
All that has consequences on the political stability of the region `` - one said .
From the point of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian guard is no single phenomenon in central east Europe , therefore the political risk has grown for the whole region .
As reported , the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard whose foundation was announced in August , 2007 by the radically right-wing Bulgarian national union ( BNU ) .
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard there stood the Roma-mass excesses which have taken place in a town quarter of Sofia ( Krasna Poljana ) .
The BNU has taken the incidents immediately to the occasion for the foundation of the national guard , with the argument that the purpose of the organization is the `` national protection `` .
In her opinion a regular `` Gipsy 's terror '' was perceptible since during the past 17 years in Bulgaria , nevertheless , the state remained idle and indifferent - thus Political Capital .
And further : The initiative would have kicked off a violent debate in the Bulgarian general public .
As said , the raised risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that have announced some Bulgarian Roma-Organisationen to found her own guard for opposition purposes .
Because the activities of the Hungarian guard up to now many resemblances to those point to the Bulgarian national guard , it is not to be excluded that Hungarian Roma likewise , with organizing her own protection react to the menaces , one says in the risk warning report of Political Capital .
Attila Juhász , research manager with Political Capital said on inquiry of the press agency : The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute .
Yearly risk analysis reports would be published , and should be recognizable to risk-changing trends , the public opinion is informed , how in the case by the publication of the risk warning report .

Nicaraguanisches court confirms 20-year-old prison sentence for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the 20-year-old prison sentence for the former president Arnold Alemán to which he had been condemned in 2003 because of finance deception at the rate of 100 million dollars ( nearly 1.8 billion crowns ) .

The climate on the Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was maybe once a pleasant place to the life , said scientists yesterday .
Data of a European spaceship located on an orbit show that the planet resembles a turned away twin of the earth even more than up to now was aware .
The Venus is the näheste planet-aryan neighbor of the earth .
Both worlds own about the same size and have similar planet roads , indeed , the Venus of the sun is a little closer .
Before billions from years would have ruled on the Venus conditions which would have been very similarly to those on the earth and could have been even inhabitable , believe scientists today .
But because of the carbon dioxide greenhouse effect without brakes , the erosion of the atmosphere by solar irradiation and a slower rotation tempo the Venus smashed another developing course .
Today the planet is robbed by water and has a surface temperature which is hot enough to melt lead and is laid waste by hurricane-strong hoists and flash storms .
The knowledge of the space probe Venus express train of the European space agency which has examined the planning for a year offers a sobering look at how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic changes in climate .
Professor Fred Taylor of the department of physics at the university of Oxford , one of the leaders of the Venus express train mission , said : `` It becomes clear , why the climate on the Venus so passed away to that of the earth is , while the planets are quite similar to themselves otherwise. ``
`` Our new data enable to construct a scenario in which the Venus has begun before billions from years like the earth , possibly with an inhabitable environment. ``

Bush draws an arrangement between Israelis and Palestinians
By the opening of the international peace conference which had assembled on Tuesday under his management in Annapolis , Maryland , president Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had agreed , finally , on a common explanation .
He further explained that Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin immediately with negotiations to find a final regulation of the 60 year-old disputes between her both people .
In the presence of both men Bush promised that he will do everything to help them , to close before the end of 2008 Friedensvertrag `` .
In the interim the Palestinians must destroy die terrorist infrastructures `` and Israel must put his Kolonisierungsarbeiten , explained Bush and he reminded both parties of her obligations in view of Fahrplan `` for the peace to which these had agreed in 2003 .
The boss of the White House stressed that the negotiations aim at a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinian authority under Abbas , after all , which should clear all open questions without exception , and including the central questions `` .
This name encloses three serious problems on which the disputes primarily turn between Israelis and Palestinians : the future borders of Palestine , the status of Jerusalem and the destiny of the Arabian refugees who were expelled in the course of the conflict of 1948 from her native country which lies in the today 's state Israel .
According to the American president Abbas seized the word and insisted on the fact that the coming negotiations umfassend and thoroughly `` are led and deliver for all points a regulation , and he unter other Jerusalem , the refugees which enumerated borders , the colonies , waters and security .
When Olmert seized on his part the word , he committed himself to the fact that the coming armistice negotiations direkt and without interruption `` are led and to the fact that he will take care that these can be still finished before the end of 2008 .
Bush has fixed the term to the conversion of his Vision two states `` , Palestinian one and Israeli one which exist side by side for the end of 2008 .
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance in this sense of Bush from Bush , before it resolved to take part in the conference .
Arabia whose participation shows a big success for Washington in Annapolis has escorted a plan assumed by all Arabian lands in the ways which offers the peace to Israel , in the exchange with his retreat from all Arabian areas which had been taken during the war in 1967 , including East Jerusalem .
Annapolis shows a scabbard way in the history of middle East , particularly because it in the roots of the conflict and in his central points of view attacks `` , thinks the Saudi-Arabian prince in his interview with the Arabian-speaking newspaper financed by Saudi money .

Deceitful broker risked billions because of feeling of inferiority
Bottomless swindler
Thus French bank giant Société Générale , owner of the local Komerční banka calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel .
She came since because of him about nearly five billion euros .
However , it seems rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to touch it his colleagues , in addition , certainly was not incapable .
To the difference to all big bank houses he recognized on time the crisis by the amerikanischenn mortgage market .
`` He is psychically rather weak , `` was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors who indicated him at the police .
How , however , it arises from the statements Kerviels which published the French media , for example , the newspaper Le moons , he was a person , the end of the last year with his shops profits at the rate of 1.6 billion euros had achieved .
Crisis not only in America
`` Everything what I wanted was to be earned for my bank money , `` he states in his statement .
In summer he had succeeded in earning half a billion euros just on the American crisis .
In addition he had spotted of the opportunity since already in the beginning of the year .
In February there was the quite first news about the fact that so-called Sub Prime mortgages , like they had income-weak customer or such , the before redemption problems , would be given , get in difficulties .
However , influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis .
Kerviel did not believe this and kept right .
In the end of the year he had raised his profit up to 1.6 billion euros .
`` Already as me the first half a billion had earned , I did not know how I should explain this , `` admits Kerviel and repeats that he has kept definitively nothing for himself .
During the whole questioning he admits that he has faked documents , so that one would not come to him on the tricks .
He succeeded even in leading his bosses behind the light , even if bit by bit the Eurex stock exchange been interested in his shops .
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up ?
Probably barely .
`` I thought that she satisfies the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billions for the bank. ``
Where from he took the courage to risk so much ?
He had to work his position gradually .
He entered into the Société Générale in 2000 , immediately after he had finished his study at the university of Lyons .
His annual salary amounted to about 51,000 dollars .
After two years he was already an assistant of a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars .
Still he knew that he will never earn so much like others .
`` Already in my first conversation in 2005 I knew that one observed me .
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development , `` explained Kerviel the inquisitor .
But soon after his entry there came the first big success .
With the stocks of the alliance he earned a lot , while he put half a billion euros on course losses of this title in the London bomb attacks .
And this was the trigger - now he wanted more .
As long as you do profit , we leave you
`` This is like a snowball , `` he said the policeman .
But the bosses knew supposedly about all , or anticipated it .
`` As long as I earned money , one closed the eyes. ``
However , then the big blow came at the beginning of this year .
During one single day he lost a billion euros .
On a week-end at the middle of January he wanted to compensate this .
When he came on Monday to the work , he was already no more an employee of the bank .
And a few days later the bank announced that it has lost because of him five billion euros .
And how did they come to him on the tricks ?
Suspicious he came along by a vacation .
`` I have taken only four days of the year before .
A broker who takes no vacation is one which does not want that one looks to him in the maps , `` said Kerviel finally .

Is the loan crisis of America credit card market infectious ?
If blood is in the water , it is is only natural , that dorsal fins excitedly herumwirbeln .
Now where property market of America ails , the predators have the credit card market of the land in the visor .
Analysts of Goldman Sachs calculate on the fact that the credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the infection danger of underfinanced loans spreads out to other forms of consumption loans .
Signs of the strain are clearly visible .
There are increases by the writing offs as well as with the default rates which measure the interest of the loans which are not retractable in each case or too late more than 30 days .
The HSBC has announced last month that it has taken 1.4 billion dollars of fee elevation from her American consumer 's financing , partially because of the weakness of credit card takers .
It is still too early to go to ruin in panic .
Losses and defaults are still low .
According to rating agency Moody the third quarter-default rate of 3.89 % nearly a full percent point was under the historical average .
The deterioration with the rates can be explained partly by technical factors .
A change in the American private insolvency right laws in 2005 led to a sudden case of declarations of bankruptcy which put out again for a big part of the Keditkartenverluste ; the number of the registrations ( and with it default fees ) would rise again whether the general conditions on applicant for the credit get worse or not .
The industry also reports about respectable payment rates which point how much from her debts the consumers every month pay off
and the trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong , in spite of the shutdown in other corners of the structured financing .
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup , a research enterprise , calculates on the fact that the issue amounts will be 25 % higher for 2007 , in the end , than the last year .
There are direct infection canals between the real estates loan crisis and the credit card market absolutely : it is more likely that consumers take up credit card debts , now that own home loans dry up .
However , the map exhibitors look at the monetary river instead of on capital values , therefore , falling house prices do not release necessarily a change in the creditworthiness of the applicant for the credit .
They can be an advantage even for the map exhibitors .
The incentive sink for consumers to pay furthermore the mortgage rates if the real estates are less value than the value of the advance ; as a result the map debts under the repayment priorities become more important .
Map exhibitors can also react much faster and more adaptably than credit grantor to the stormier conditions , while they change interest rates or loan borders .
This should reduce theoretically the risk of a quick new assessment of the assets .
`` We will wake of no day and revalue the advances completely `` , says Gary Perlin , Capital Ones main finance adviser .
Even if a sudden untercover crisis is unlikely in the credit card market , the risks of a lasting recession are considerably more real .
If lower house prices and a loan decrease push America in the recession , the industry will stand certainly before a more fierce future .
If they hold to wide look out after these shark fish fins .

More than one third of the pregnancies is not still planned
This calculation takes into consideration the undesirable pregnancies ( 24 % ) , just as the badly planned or unforeseen births .
Also even today , 40 years after acceptance of the Neuwirth law which permitted the contraception in France one of three pregnancies ( 36 % ) is not planned as a study of the national institute of demographic studies ( Ined ) points .
This calculation takes into consideration the undesirable pregnancies ( 24 % ) , just as the badly planned or unforeseen births .

Climate propaganda
Because the climate debate put the sceptics of the climate change as well as those , with respect to that a social and political debate in the foreground , submits to a pitiless criticism , the movement as whole ones must display a strong cohesion .
Above all if it concerns a leader of the movement who , like in case of head of the provincial government Zapatero , the fight against the climate change for more important holds than the fight of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests concluding a neuen contract with the planet `` .
This suggestion brings him , nevertheless , in explanation need with regard to the action , or non-action of his government which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain within the EU stands at the head of the lands which have fulfilled the default of the Kioto protocol in the least one .
Who are the persons responsible for the non-fulfillment of the default on which sectors this is to be led back , and why his government which had suggested Vertrag with the planet `` has not stopped this development .
Now , in addition , he is made demonstrate measures against the climate change without circumlocutions to the Spanish citizens from him intended .
Which companies will be concerned by which behavior of the citizens should be changed to which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and which economic results arise from it .
Precise said who must sacrifice itself and will pay for the rescue of the planet .
Indeed , it has and there will be in future no such explanations .
Just because it is for itself about sacrificing and the payment .
Since the measures which can be used against the climate change really are unpopular .
They are rich in costs , uncomfortable and menacingly for the accounts of the companies and citizens .
Even that of the PSOE suggested gasoline cent seemed to Zapatero electoral-strategically seen so dangerous that he felt constrained to take back the suggestion again .
Now accordingly it is a matter of saving the planet with Nothing , thus with pure propaganda and empty sayings without every real consequences .
With impressive statements , committees , committees , protocols and new offices .
With his contracts with the planet the so suitable politician otherwise for electoral campaigns neither must talk , nor accuses , nor demand , follow , instead , however , the demanding issue to decorate the meetings and to inspire others with his gentleness and goodness .
However , this can happen only if the contract does not deviate from his purely virtual nature and also does not give , therefore that the bicycle becomes from now on the only locomotion means or we may refresh ourselves only with a field .

Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the quarrel around the brand `` kingdom of Walachei `` .
Indeed , of the judge in the municipal court in Ostrava according to he has used as more first the name `` Walachischer of king `` , but the project had built up in long-standing work a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor .
Today Polívka did not take part in the negotiations .
However , according to his lawyer the thing is not probably finished with it and his mandator will probably insert appeal .
`` The quarrel goes about the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitär , `` said after the negotiations Polívkas lawyer .
Everything fancied just this actor and comedian with the words `` Walachisches of kingdom `` .
Of the same opinion is also Harabiš .
`` We have an almost ten-year-old work behind ourselves .
He said monetary procurement and drafts of the activities , `` .
To him according to the occasion is a quarrel around money .
`` After years has struck them that the project is successful and that they could also have a little bit of it .
They want to win parasitär in our work , `` he repeated .
Lucrative business
According to the court used Polívka the name `` Walachischer of king `` for the first time in one of his telecasts .
In 1993 actor Radoslav Brzobohat ý crowned him .
At that time , however , this did not hang together with the intention to found a fictive kingdom .
Some years later there came Harabiš on the thought to spend walachische passports .
From an originally funny action there crystallized a business and an enterprise activity out to which Harabiš connected then the foundation of the company `` Walachisches of kingdom `` .
In 1997 Polívka of the use of his name and his signature agreed in the passports and offered to her owners even reductions in the visit of his farm and his stage performances .
Who will sit on the throne ?
Today the judge also stated that Harabiš used only the bare idea which has publicized Polívka in the broadcasting `` manege '' for his enterprise intentions .
`` The popularity Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the walachischen kingdom , `` said the judge .
However , she added that the soul of the project Harabiš and his team are which would have intensely devoted themselves to him .
The collaboration of the parties fallen out today lasted up to 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín .
Since then , however , there started to pile up between Polívka and Harabiš the disputes which culminated in the dismissal `` king Boleslavs I. electively up to the Saint Nimmerleins day `` .
Then the guide roller took up on suggestion Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother .
Then in 2002 Polívka submitted the complaint which rejected the court today against Harabiš and his company .
The competition prepared by Harabiš could bring clearness in the quarrel around the throne and half a princess .
A new king should arise from it .
He did not want to betray details and an appointment yet .
`` We want to rush nothing .
It should be such a thing like the king 's relocation in the Walachei .
The king should be chosen for a certain time .
Also Mr. Polívka can announce himself with it quietly , `` Harabiš added .

British Bänker confess guilty in the case Enron
Three British bankers who should be put for her role in the deceitful system with the former main finance leader by Enron , Andrew Fastow , in court changed her requests in guilty on Wednesday .
David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had innocently pleaded originally for seven cases of deception at the risk of tele-communicative devices for the supposed Konspirieren with Fastow in a confidential finance deception in 2000 to get rich at the expenses of her employer on .
The procedure had been attached for January .
But during a hearing in court before US-district judge Ewing Werlein junior everybody pleaded for a case of deception at the risk of tele-communicative devices guilty .
Three former executives of Greenwich NatWest , a unity of Royal bank of Scotland Group PLC , were known in Great Britain in the course of delivery procedures which lasted two years .
In the United States her case is a loose end of an investigation which was begun to Enrons breakdown in 2001 .
The accusations originally submitted against them in 2002 drew the attention of Fastow to the fact that it was the purpose of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron decline .
The accusation against the bankers - called the `` NatWest Three `` - maintains , they have come in 2000 to Houston to cook up a deceitful plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper .
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron which was controlled by Fastow which was the architect of countless deceitful Enron machination which has served to tear the company in the bankruptcy whirlpool .
In the beginning of 2002 the bank had estimated the value her participation in the subsidiary at zero , but three British men knew that she had considerable value in reality .
An enterprise under Koppers control acquired the shares of the bank in the subsidiary for 1 million dollars .
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a participation in this enterprise .
According to the accusation Fastow represented falsely compared with Enron that the energy enterprise would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for her shares in the subsidiary .
But really the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers , Fastow and others .
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars , while Fastow , Kopper and other about 12.3 million dollars skimmed milk , according to the accusation .
In January , 2004 Fastow confessed in two charges on conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy guilty .
The British trio was arrested three months later .
Fastow sits out a 6-year-old imprisonment in the federal prison of Louisiana .
Kopper sits out a punishment of three years and one month in an equipment in Texarkana .
Each of three men was at large on grounds of 1 million dollars of security which required that they lived in the United States in expectation of the court procedure .
Enron , once the seventh-biggest enterprise of the nation , crumbled in the bankruptcy in December , 2001 , after years of buchhalterischen tricks could veil no more longer the billion debts or schwächelnde enterprises profitable allow to seem .
The breakdown destroyed thousands of workplaces , more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans from .
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former chairman of the board Jeffrey Skilling were condemned the last year for her roles in connection with the Enron breakdown .
Skilling sits out a punishment of more than 24 years .
Lays convictions for conspiracy , deception and other charges became trifling , after he passed away the last year because of heart illness .

Richard Gere is not simply cynical enough
Two films with the Balkan war deal with `` The Hunting of party `` and `` of murderous peace `` again .
However , both are not convincing .
Either the drafts place too much on action and Geballer or , however , them are too soppy .
There Richard Gere can also not help in `` The Hunting of party `` .
The good news first : Indeed , the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans , but just there , now in the sombre hinterland of the Bosnia war , the actor Richard Gere has been found again .
We had lost the nicest man of the eighties years last out of sight because much too many nice-insignificant roles drove out the desire for glance in films for good sensations for women and much too many press conferences on the subject Buddhism to one .
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument , himself `` The Hunting party - If the hunter becomes the hunted `` ( Why must film titles be so long today , actually , always and be weird like train driver 's wage agreements ? ) to consider maybe , nevertheless .
He delivers a wonderfully winking representation : Basically his war reporter Simon Hunt is that what could have become from Gere if the destiny and the film branch were not so merciful : A man who has his very best times long behind himself which has still preserved substantial rests of the former charm , however , itself as the monument same to ruins of his decline .
But in spite of this trump `` The Hunting of party `` continues only the endless row of failed Balkan war-films together with the German production `` of murderous peace `` which likewise starts this week .
With `` murderous peace `` one can do short process : The film acts from two German soldiers in Kosovo ( Adrian Topol , Max Riemelt ) who save a Serbian before kosovarischen sniper on which to itself one falls in love promptly still in them .
Although it is welcome that here once the Serbians are not shown as a sole root all evil , the television-level film loses itself much too fast in Geballer and action .
There remains a kind `` alarm for Cobra 11 `` without highway , however , for it with war .
Against it can be investigated in `` The Hunting of party `` virtually exemplarily , why there has never been , actually , a really good Balkans-war film .
The history of three US-war reporters who start to track down the Serbian upper war criminal `` the fox `` could have become with another director and another scriptwriter ( both in personal union Richard Shepard ) another time maybe new `` Apocalypse Now '' .
Since the stories are similar remarkably : Both times go small teams to the wood to accomplish something what the military can not do and both times it becomes a trip in the insanity .
One of the reasons for the failure of `` The Hunting of party `` is that one does not allow to be Simon Hunt simply the dilapidated cynic with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning .
No , the Script must still impute a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to him in addition .
Finally `` The Hunting of party `` goes brook under it when the reporters within the last five minutes in the time-lapse photography procedure manage this what Nato , CIA and all reward hunters of the world have not created in five years : The war criminal catch and leave to the Muslim Bosnians to the fair revenge .
This is so bad that one would like to call the international court of law in Hague because of crimes against the film logic .
Besides , the film has a profoundly human concern .
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic walk around still freely , and he suspects the Americans and here the French ( should agree they exceptionally sometimes ) to pursue the pursuit on account of confidential political arrangements not too intensely .
But the well meant and this Nastily are sometimes so similar to themselves that to one a famous Brecht 's poem comes to the sense .
In it one says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the working table of the poet : `` Compassionately I see the swollen forehead veins , suggestive : how exerting it is to be angry `` .
Films like `` The Hunting of party `` have exactly such Schwellköpfe which indicate , however , how exerting it is to be good .
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film .
Recently is in this newspaper reports become that all Iraq films of Hollywood were big flops .
One can add : There has never still been a good South Africa film .
Almost always counts : If a star on the crisis stoves or mine fields of the world hangs around , besides , such a thing comes out like `` Rangoon '' with Patricia Arquette , `` beyond all borders `` with Angelina Jolie or `` blood diamonds '' with Leonardo DiCaprio .
All conflicts are chronologically simply possibly still too close .
Decades had to pass , at least , before Hollywood with `` roofer 's list `` could turn a good film about the Holocaust .
Some film will probably still mature - the Vietnam works counting now as a classic `` The Deer of Hunter `` , `` Apocalypse Now '' or `` Full Metal of jacket `` have been celebrated at that time by no means unanimously as masterpieces .
But today maybe we know where every mass murder comes on a real-time basis on immediately two screens at home , also simply too much about the conflicts of the world .
And this robs the screenplay writers of the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs it to tell good stories .
`` His or non-existence `` or '' the big dictator `` have become so good , in the end , also because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet how badly the Nazi regime really ruled .
Maybe one may not want to be good if one wants to do good films .
Maybe one must have the sarcastically reserved artist 's look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk .
When was questioned about parallels between his historical novel `` Lemprières Wörterbuch '' and the Balkan war , he answered : `` This is only due to the fact that some things never change .
Cities will be dangerous always terribly , people will be murdered always in horrific way and always war will rule in Yugoslavia. ``

The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan for the point for round of the last sixteen
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight on the next Tuesday in San Siro for the point which they lack to reach her respective purposes still before end of the Championsleague qualifying round . The Italians need to reach sharp at to the point of her group , while this decides with the Scots on her participation .
The Italian team already has five points and have confirmed her participation already in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal , while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs still an other one to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up the Befica Lisbon with four points .
Two plays of the group D will take place one week before end of the sixth play round , because Milan FC must line up in the FIFA club world championship in Japan where he will fight in the 13ten in the semi-final for the first time for the entry into the finale which takes place in the 16ten .
Thus this group will be concluded before all others and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to the result expected everywhere , even if both teams will will try to win . The Italians will not want to speculate at home since the Keltik Glasgow knows which they would become in case of a victory of groups-first and would dispose with it of a better starting position in the round of the last sixteen .
A defeat could be enough even with a setback of the FC Shakhtar for the team of Gordon Strachan to qualify .

England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas , each of it almost as difficultly as the other .
Who should hit as a number 6 for England in Kandy on this week-end , Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara ?
And , not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka who should meet the decision ?
The second question is important because David Graveney , the electoral chairperson , on call is at least under this special title , here to decide to help of coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in it , and because the table of High Morries , the English managing manager , bit by bit with applications fills for national electoral offices , if not even for which in partial time .
Whoever the sixth racquet position does not agree , will be unhappy , but the life is often unfair and the sport is indubitable it .
It is never easy , precise to nail what enables a person to reach the point of his branch of profession , while not everyone never comes out about the lowest rank , sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability .
It is not only in the cricket where the choice is difficult where judgments are necessary which are subjective always at the end .
Is it to be climbed up the right time for Bopara ?
Is it fair to Shah if he acts ?
The same one can be asked maybe also in another area whether , for instance , John Edwards or `` Tubby '' Banerjee , both the intelligent young executives should be carried with good end which know the business well .
Who can say what is the right class for a cricketer , unless , to him the possibility is given , to swim or to set .
Naturally figures have a big influence on decisions , but chances also have this .
Within a team a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain at the right time if he can take a Wicket and a racquet must get regular chances on the order if he wants to do impression as a one-day cricketer .
To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complex .
There were many , which in the last season better than , for example , when James Anderson were who will apparently play in the first test , even if Stephen Harmison explains himself for healthy and how the wind bowls in the nets .
Anderson took 32 high-class Wickets with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour .
Chris Tremlett took only 29 by the same modest average , but both had her highlights and hope on even more .
Whether Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stage plays , only one view question can be .
The choice could decide the careers of both men , or it does maybe , nevertheless , little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first , nevertheless , with five Wickets and runs with 40 useful , it was Paul Collingwood to strengthen at that time still fighting around himself which created the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and who , although he dotted a double Hundred against Australia in Australia , is maybe still underestimated .
It is likely that Graveney , Vaughan and moor , after an other discussion in the course of the today 's net meeting in the Asgiriya stage will follow her conservative instincts and belly feeling for Shahs bigger experience about Boparas youthful enthusiasm .
There are arguments for both .
For Shah his sparkling and valuable 88 Test-Debüt-Innings speaks in Bombay , 43 high-class hundreds and only six of Bopara which is younger at the age of 22 years seven years and an excellent balance against turned on balls .
But Shah did only ten runs in his two Innings in the May against west Indies in the test in lord , his home arena as a player from Middlesex , and this , plus his immediate refusal of the Auswählern was healthy as a Vaughan to take back his position for the next play , seems to have taken the swing from his hitting which was still evident in Bombay .
By contrast the Alleskönner from Essex has shovel-wise joy of life .
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket place and his posture apart of it was summed up when he had recently skipped a vehicle with 4-bicycle impulse in an exhibit for sponsor of England Volkswagen .
He suffered smaller injuries and presumably a shock , but the first what he did , his Vodafone ( of course also gesponsort ) was to be got out and to call his team colleague Alastair Cook who had observed this from a distance and to say with enthusiasm : `` Have you seen this ? `` .
Bopara is a lot of better player , he bowls his middle tempo with some effect here on the fields what seems to fit to him and hits with confidence and talent .
The right man is to be chosen a thing to choose the right time another .
Maybe this is the real art of the choice .
Now I bend to it Bopara to give his chance what does not mean that , nevertheless , Shah will not well maybe stand there if , as the tea sentence from Ceylon suggests , he is that which will play here this week-end .

600000 people did not succeed in exchanging her driving licence
600000 drivers missed the term to exchange her old driving licence whose validity at the end of the year runs off .
Today is the last day where one can apply for the exchange , so that the authorities get to issue a new driving licence up to the end of the year .
However , the ministry does not fear that after New Year hundred thousands drivers proceed without valid driving authorization on the streets .
According to the authorities primarily those have not exchanged her driving licence which do not want to go at all .
While small places strong dropping of the interest in the Füherscheinumtausch announce , the offices of the capital are covered with applications , and the interest in the exchange still grew this week .
The city administration dispatches daily about 2000 customers .
One must be waiting about half an hour .
In Prague approx . 140000 drivers have not exchanged her driving licence yet .
The exhibit a new driving licence lasts 20 days .
But it is possible to apply for the exhibit with a shortened term of five days .
However , in this case the driver must 500 crowns dazuzahlen .
A fine threatens from January the drivers who do not create the prescribed exchange up to the end of the year and drive off without valid driving licence .
The malefactor pays maximum 2,000 crowns .
The police leaves it , however , by the violation also with an admonition bewenden .
In case of a violation the punishment on 2,500 crowns can rise .
According to earlier information that of the municipality can also get a punishment imposed which does not go at all .
To him can threaten it is said so , a punishment of even 30,000 crowns .
The ministry called on the offices already to let prevail mildness and to impose at most a punishment of 1,000 crowns .

The validity of the driving licences which were issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December , 2013 .
Besides , according to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 millions other driving licences .

Six deterrent little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails , to send off we forgotten , linguistic news which we never receive - harmless lies which do not strike us at all : They bring `` color '' in the everyday life in the workplace .
The question is bare whether one gets used to this small inconvenience , or one better positions himself to the challenge and tries these ambiguous , for other irritating situations consciously to vermweiden .
Tips .
`` Sorry , I have forgotten to aim to you that somebody has called of the marketing department `` - a colleague says .
The fact that one has thereby missed a meeting ?
At best one regrets it and tries to make up for it , while one maybe calls with the marketing department and confesses remorseful , one would have forgotten to straighten the news ( this is the less usual method ) .
The thing with an excuse is mostly dismissed .
Before one gets entangled in embarrassing excuses , one should consider with which one can prepare really disagreeable moments for his colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously .
A little bit lent what belongs to itself ?
There is barely something more irritating , as if one reaches for a document , office accessories , or the phone , however , it is not there .
Yesterday the stapler still lay on the desk - today early it is away ?
Or is he discovered lost believed ballpoint pens possibly on the desk of a colleague ?
Without one should ask himself nothing of the colleagues lend , because they are annoyed rightly if they find out that something has got away .
Thus , no envelope or Post-its from the office in the pocket are , because it could meet one itself : nothing more there if one needs it , nevertheless , urgently .
Getratsche about the private life of the colleagues ?
There are no effective means to detain a gossip which was already put in the world .
Who with whom , what done ?
Where and which is why ?
One should bind the information ( or supposition ) about the private life of the colleagues as far as possible not to everybody to the nose !
And if , nevertheless , somebody opens and betrays to us his most internal secret , we should not abuse this trust !
Best of all one is quiet like a grave instead of straightening the just not person present , even if other about the problems of the colleague also know .
Without reason ill announced ?
If one calls in the office to announce himself with reference to tantalizing headaches ill because one feels just unwell , or just would like to rest , one should be about one in the clear : Now own work , unpushable open executions , projects with steady appointments must do the colleagues instead of itself .
Colleagues join in not horribly !
If the day before one knows already that one will not create it the next day in the office , or that something could interfere , why one must stay at home , one should announce it on time , so that neither the colleagues , nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence .
Gesumme , giggling , phoning
One is deepened just in his work , it is disturbed , however , suddenly by the loud giggling of the colleagues ?
Unintentionally a telephone call listened which one should not better have heard ?
One should irritate the colleagues not with sums , singing , loud conversations ( which one leads over her heads away ) , trampling , to durable cursing or grumbling .
All that can be very annoying , even if they write not exactly in a task ( , plan , organize ) are deepened .
Are the others to blame always ?
If a project is not ready in time , one has forgotten an important letter or important directing to send off , one should not search the guilt of own forgetfulness with others !
As far as possible one should not unburden himself on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues !
Best of all one admits his mistakes to himself , and apologizes , if other were also concerned by it !
The question , as one make up for the mistake , or the missed can make up , is only much too right !
In the office - a feeling like at home ?
Tracksuit bottoms and Schlapfen : However , comfortably for at home , nothing has lost in the office !
Then one should not even dress so casually if it the workplace admitted , actually !
Only do not become too sloppy - one should his colleagues , as well as respect himself so far that one dresses in the office accordingly - if desirably , also nicely and elegantly !

Klaus : Debates of the ecologists are unplausible
Global climate changes damage supposedly to developing countries mostly .
President Václav Klaus commented again to the problems of the global warming .
Now the criticism referred to the coming to an end international conference of UN to the climate change on Bali .
In Vienna where he presented his book `` blue , no green planet `` he explained that the debates of the ecologists are unplausible .
According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of not-government organizations , but also the basic difference between the rhetoric which she accompanies , and the reality .
`` The debate there is unstructured , these are word fireworks , the only substitute is for a real solution of present problems , `` said Klaus .
The Czech president stressed by the image of his book that his subject is very important for him , and that he is involved in it , therefore , so .
He also expressed his contentment about the fact that his book appears in German translation because `` I often hit on caricatures of my views. ``
Now prospective customers could read up his setting undistorted .
Klaus reminded of the fact that it is no Klimatologe , but he has to his opinion after sufficient conditions to write such a book .
He is , in the end , a graduate to understand capable , technical treatises and to judge , experience with statistics has and is also an economist .
He called the thesis main statement of the book that the climate changes constantly and that his changes are normal that there is no correspondent opinion among the scientists to the global warming that the results of the present changes are big not too and serious and showed therefore no menace , and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are is superfluous , luxurious ineffectively and unacceptably .
In addition , he holds it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen , for unacceptable to force upon other unproven views he considers as a dangerous restriction of the freedom .
On questions of persons present he explained repeatedly , he is not against a `` reasonable environment protection , but against militant ecological activists who take no consideration on the relation between expenditure and yield. ``
About the same subject Klaus had spoken in Vienna already two months ago in the Hayek institute .

National debts become in 2009 on a trillion to quick to high ones
A national debt of 84,000 crowns is cancelled to every Czech .
The whole guilt rose till the end of September on 842.7 billion crowns .
The government had planned to get into debt this year with 159.2 billions Konen .
At the beginning of December the ministry thanks to the better development of the state Hauhaltspolitik reduced the plan , nevertheless , on 152.8 billions .
The national debts of Czech Republic rose till the end of September on 842.7 billion crowns .
Within the first nine months of this year they rose therefore by 40.2 billions .
However , since June they sank by 13.4 billions .
The Ministry of Finance confirmed with it his information about the national debts from beginning of October .
A guilt of 84,000 crowns is cancelled to every Czech .
About the whole last year the state got into debt around more than 111 Miliarden crowns .
`` Till present it seems that we will cross the border of a trillion crowns possibly thanks to the lower deficit for the next year only in 2009 .
The next year the debts should move between 900 billions and a trillion crowns , `` said David Marek , analyst of the Patria Finance , to the server iHNed.cz .
Similarly it sees Vladimír Pikora , analyst of the Next Finance : `` To the excess of a trillion we could come in the course of 2009 .
When exactly , depends on the next household which we do not know yet .
If should appear that the situation on the political stage changes , and the politicians should be ready more to save , could last up to 2010 .
But from such a change I do not go out , `` he noted .
Debts grow
The national debt is due to the debts of the state government and comes above all from the accumulation of deficits of the budget .
The national debt is financed by treasure instructions , state debentures , direct loans or , for example , by loans of the European investment bank .
The home state indebtedness rose this year meanwhile on 719.4 billion crowns .
The foreign debts of the state rose meanwhile by 1.7 billion crowns on 123.3 billions .
The so-called national debt capable of market reached billions crowns at the end of September , 803.3 and sank since June by 13.7 billions .
The average maturity of the national debts rose for 6.5 years .
`` The whole guilt rose about the year from first up to the third quarter by 13 percent what is really a lot in view of that how well it goes for the economy .
It is interesting that the taking is to be registered above all with the debentures where the increase amounts to 20 percent .
It is bad that the debts rise , but then this shows that one can undertake something , already before the pension reform comes , `` commented Pikora the data .
Better than expects
From the financing strategy and the contact with the national debts for 2007 it arises that the government had planned for this year to take up 159.2 billion crowns .
At the beginning of December the ministry thanks to the better development of the state Hauhaltspolitik reduced the plan , nevertheless , on 152.8 billion crowns .
This amount is due above all to the state budget deficit which will reach obviously 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billions this year .
Further it concerns at most included in the plan means for the consolidation agency at the rate of 13.3 billion crowns , a 10 billions reserve to the payment of the pensions , the financing of state debentures for 43 billions and rates for the loans at the European investment bank at the rate of 1.8 billions .

The indicator , the euro action to of the judgement of the inflation rate within the European Union serves , delivers in Spain in November taken place average price trend .
His publication corresponds to the principles of euro action and the European central bank ( EZB ) which aim at a local comparison and at high-class comparison to US products by the announcement of the data .
The prediction for the indicator can be provided prematurely , while one applies the same approach like with the harmonized consumer price index , but at the same time still uses various other statistical modelling methods not to estimate at the time of the calculation to available information .
Nevertheless the Spanish statistics office ( INE ) sent a reminder that the prematurely ascertained indicator serves only as an appoximate value , and , hence , with the final result which is announced in coming 14th December must not agree .

Department of attack
In the Youtube debate of the republican presidential candidates both favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver to themselves a hard exchange - and now must fear an outsider 's candidate .
The strain of the candidates already discharges with the first subject .
He has done New York a `` sanctuary for unlawful immigrants `` , Mitt Romney accuses of his opponent Rudy Giuliani .
This counters on his part with heavy reproaches : `` I would say , his own house was a harbour for unlawful `` , replies Giuliani and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of having occupied privately immigrant without papers .
The candidates blow to the attack : Because the republican base has furthermore no clear favorite , eight presidency candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit her opponents .
The selfrotated 30-second videos in which Internet users via Youtube have sent barely are more than one .
`` With this kind of isolationism we let come Hitler to the power `` , accuses John McCain his opponent Ron Paul who demands an immediate deduction from Iraq as only in the round .
Also Romney agrees from the Vietnam veteran hard read the riot act when he refuses which is simulated so-called `` Waterboarding '' , a questioning method , while drowning to condemn as a torture .
The fact that the important subjects of the campaign lie , in the meantime , nevertheless , on the other side from Iraq war and torture debates , the reactions of the hall audience point in St. Petersburg in Florida .
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax rises are rejected , applause on surges in the lecture hall .
Besides , appears once more where the weaknesses of both favorites lie .
`` At that time I have wandered `` , explains Romney contritely and performs before base and television audience for it apology that he belonged in 1994 still to the abortion advocates .
However , Giuliani comes to the rolling when he is asked according to his opinion to the literal interpretation of the Bible .

Everything still openly
Mitt Romey said , he holds it of no presidential candidate worthy to be questioned by a snowman .
Nevertheless , the republican candidate agreed for the presidency , in the end to position himself to a debate on YouTube in which normal voters take up questions on video and submit to send them to the candidate .
None of the questions which were thrown up on the Wednesday evening , 28th November , were as ridiculous as the snowman , the democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party conferred with .
But the questions , and the answers , reflected this time exactly the state of the republican party which opens in the choices next year .
It is not known , precise like the producers by CNN , which the debate to the cosupported ones which selected the beginning candidate YouTube to be shown clips .
However , in the first half an hour of the debate which was dedicated longest to a single subject immigration stood in the center .
The subject is one of the most efficient subjects for Republicans .
A group of undecided voters asked the CNN to serve a Wählscheibe if they heard things which they liked : The television company noted points of the approval as the candidates strictly about the borders spoke .
The most sharp and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani , the national forerunner , and Romney who has pushed in the determining surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire forwards .
Giuliani tries to shake off the call , he has been compliantly concerning unlawful immigration when he was a mayor of New York .
He attacked Romney in he the former governor of Massachusetts accused , unlawful immigrants for work on his house to have put .
The both sat down especially violently apart as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates gave an `` Amnestie '' ( the unlawful a regular status and the possibility on the citizenship ) would support .
More unimportant candidates like Duncan Hunter , a California congressional representative , and Tom Tancredo , a congressional representative from Colorado , it succeeded with this subject nachzuhaken .
None of both men has serious chances with the nomination , but both remain in the running , maybe because they have lashed out earlier and harder than other on the immigration kettledrum .
At least in the area of the immigration the candidates divide on the whole the same views : more sharp borders , intolerance towards unlawful migrants .
This subject , together with fears about toxic toys from China or other worries about the rest of the world , the differences help the Republicans between liberal and Christian conservative to forget or to minimize .
But the debate became unambiguously problematic as other subjects were brought up .
Mr. Giuliani was asked , which is why he has supported weapon restrictions in the past .
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be looked as a torture .
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible .
This led to the fact that Giuliani represented the point of view that although the Bible is his preferential book , he thinks the history of Jonah and the whale maybe not literal .
Another questioner asked whether of Jesus the capital punishment supported .
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations on the first place in a recently carried out survey in Iowa thanks to his Christian Konservativismus existing for a long time - said that the capital punishment is painful , but necessary .
When he was pushed for whether of Jesus she would recommend , he laughed at it and said of Jesus was to be promoted too intelligently around himself around a political office .
The running stays open extremely far .
Huckabees rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls to the latest donation success and his thunderous applauses in the debate of Wednesday .
These both are sent up from Nothing because both wings of the party could not agree up to now yet on one of the more known and more traditional candidates .
In 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the outset and persuasive combinedly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party .
This time is split the party and the result is not clear by far .

Buses bring refugees back to the work - and to fight against Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria came in Bagdad yesterday , with a stream of expelled whose finances or Visas have run out , and other which hoped that the town returns to normality .
Some had even come back to fight against the rebels whom they had expelled from her houses .
In the bus railway station Mansour , even before of the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses , the terminal was actively with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports .
`` I decided to go to Syria , after they had killed many doctors in Bagdad `` , said Sabah Al-Qubaisi , a sunnitischer doctor .
`` Today I came back , because of that what I have seen on television and what I have read in the newspaper , about that what has happened in Bagdad , and how it would be sure now. ``
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people `` , he said , in relation on the Schiitenmilizen of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr , has ordered to put back his forces at the current time .
Qassim al Atwani , a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the prevailing sunnitische part of Amariyah , returned with his both children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because to work the regime Iraqi not permissibly .
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to say to him that a local militia supported by the USA has served to expel al-Qaeda from her bastion in the west of the capital , and penetrated him to the return .
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader sunnitischen and Shiite trunk which had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with grenades , after he had requested his fellow citizens to the fight Al-Qaidas .
He was come back to fight .
`` Two days ago some of my friends called me and said to me that they began one the Anti-Al-Qaida-Miliz in Sleikh and that they need my support and which of my boys .
This is why I have returned today `` , said Sabaah aluminum Obeidi , 62 .
Many told that they had been lured by the increasing rest in the capital since the US-troop rise and the growth more locally `` groups of members of the public aggrieved by the proposal `` which arms and in collaboration with the American military her town quarters defend .
But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and drying up finances in Damascus where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled during the last years .
Salaam al-Samarrai , a 51-year-old triple father , expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki , the Shiite Prime Minister , the Syrian government had requested to cover visa restrictions for the refugees to force people to the return .
More than 2,5 million people have presumably fled from the sectarian Todesschwadronen in the land .
`` It well went for us to al-Maliki Syria visited and the government urged to the Iraqis no more visas to give to force them to the return in Iraq `` , said of the sunnitischen pensioners .
`` I can not trust to a government which supports the criminals , my house of burned down ones , after I left. ``
A part of the reason for the decline of the power is that Sunniten from Shiite residential areas and vice versa were expelled what led to the creation of many places where tensions have decreased .
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will poke sectarian tensions again and it will come to conflicts .

Between the mountains the regions Bansko count , Borovec , Pamprovo and Vitosa to him most popular , by the sea are Albena , the `` Gold Coast '' , the `` solar coast '' , and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar the racers , are asked , indeed , real estates all around Kavarna and Balcik also more and more .

The capital Sofia offers likewise tempting offers - commercial surfaces and office surfaces offer the highest yields .
Bulgaria is to be become on the best way one of the most attractive European golfer 's paradise and to attract tourists therefore beside the summer season and wintertime also in both other seasons .
Hence , farsighted investors already make purchases now in the big style , for example , all around Bansko .

The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves hard have access to loans , for her customers loans become also more expensive .
This would reduce the consumption and overthrow the American economy in a recession , possibly with consequences on the economic growth in the whole world .
The central banks have decided on it , after they had not succeeded , the so-called . To lower LIBOR , the London interbank interest rate which is used with the monetary rental company between banks .
This means that the banks were afraid constantly to borrow money mutually , and this although the central banks of the USA , Canada and Great Britain during the autumn her interest rates several times had lowered .
`` This will have the same effect like an other sinking of the interest rates , `` Greg Salvaggio of tense Consulting of the agency said Reuters .
Some analysts are of the view that this step of the central banks contributes to the Aufheizung of the crisis because he does not solve the basic problem , namely the case of the property market in the USA .

Children exchanges - calculation : 12 millions
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic the lawyer of the injured parents , Igor Veleba , from the hospital wants to ask in Třebí č 12 million crowns of compensation plus costs of an action .
For each of the mothers three millions , for the fathers two millions and for the children a million .
The hospital offers maximum 200000 for every parental pair .
Therefore , the legal representative of the hospital , Ondřej Dostál , agrees with the suggestion Velebas not at all .
`` We reject such a suggestion , he lies around a multiple too high , `` said Dostál after the today 's negotiations .
`` To be able to form an opinion to this countersuggestion to us , however , we need the certificate which allowed to provide the opposition .
We will find out whether it generally has logical value .
However , we insist on the view that should lie for everything together in the Hunderttausenderbereich , `` stressed Dostál .
The amount should move according to him between 100000 and 200,000 crowns for each of four parents .
At the beginning the family from Jabloňov for every month which it had not gathered her biological daughter wanted a million crowns .
For Veleba a certificate which had compiled the university hospital in Prague Motol for him served as a basis for compensation negotiations .
The parents of the children suffered in the opinion of experts from the area of Psychology and psychiatry psychic damages and stress symptoms in different strength and depth .
The men stood the stress situation better , even if they were up against reproaches , they could have prevented the mistake of the newborn children .
The women manage again with the after-effects of the experienced trauma worse , as well as also with him what just runs off now Veleba summarized the contents .
Veronika and Nikola exchanged on the 9th December of the last year nurses of the maternity clinic in Třebí č .
The last week the children returned to her biological parents - Nikola to Čermáks in Přibyslavice , and Veronika to Libor Bro ž and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov .

All hospitals in Czechia are liability-insured for law .
In the case of doubt they must reach to a reserve fund , only exceptionally they can apply with the sluggish help .
The courts have awarded up to now affected persons relatively low compensation sums , the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundred thousands , exceptionally from millions .

In many places it is saved in disinfectants
This year more than thousand infections were registered in the hospitals which were to be led back on an improper contact with antibiotics .
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals , the Überbelegung of the beds , the overloading of the staff - all factors which are not quite good for damming the infections , according to the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center .
In many places it is also saved with the disinfectants .
In the Traumatologie department of the János of hospital a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed .
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was delivered after a heavy accident to the hospital .
The patient was isolated .
Here at the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection .
The injured person of a heavy car accident was dismissed from the hospital , however , after a little while the man had to return with a MRSA infection . An important operation could not since then because of the bacterium which is still in the body of the patient yet .
Until of this year 10th December 1094 infections released by multiresistant causes were announced from hospitals to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system , according to the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center , Karolina Böröcz .
So many , by multiresistant causes released infections were registered in the hospitals with certainty , however , the dark figure might be high .
About two thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) became from the MRSA , the Staphylococcus resistant to Methicillin-Oxacillin aureus released .
The Staphylococcus aureus ( SATURDAY ) bacterium carries possibly one third of the people in her nose , without it would cause an illness .
SA conditioned infections ( as for example pharyngitis , tonsillitis , inflammations of the skin or wounds ) react mostly well to antibiotics , they are well remediable .
If the means are measured , however , too high or are applied improperly , the resistant to antibiotics who spread out under suitable conditions in the hospitals fast originate from the well respondierenden bacteria .
In particular with patients with weak , or permanently badly functioning immune system , but also in older , or patients with low body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections , as for example sore infection or blood poisoning , thus sepsis .
To the medical leader of the János of hospital according to the MRSA infection is nothing special , such incidents belong to the ill house everyday life .
One may mistake the infection not for the epidemic , manhte Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is not where it is not searched .
Resistant against antibiotics
`` Such patients are isolated , the nursing staff carries elastic gloves and masks on the care , and we dispose of the antibiotics necessary for the treatment `` - thus Tibor Nyulasi .
Indeed , with her admission in the hospital the patients are examined for MRSA , an infection can be still not always avoided .
Test withdrawals too seldom
The majority of the infections released by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable , indeed , the conditions ruling nowadays and circumstances are unfavorably for the containment of the origin or the propagation of the multiresistant cause , says Karolina Böröcz .
After this infection seems mainly in hospitals and old people 's homes , the hospitals should examine the delivered patients and isolate immediately MRSA infected .
Nevertheless , in the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological test withdrawal is not carried out so often .
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation vonseiten of the state health insurance scheme .
Hence , most cases would come only in the daylight when the patient already has a sensible MRSA infection , according to the medical leader of the epidemiology center .
There is Vonseiten of the European Union strict recommendations to the suitable application of antibiotics in the human medicine , however , there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures .
Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful , that is microbiological investigations are necessary , so that no resistance to the means can form , indeed , this directive is also not always kept by hospitals .
Under the ambulant , or itself in the basic care located patients microbiological test withdrawals are even even rarer , according to Karolina Böröcz .
It is saved with the disinfectants
Scientific proofs prove that MRSA of a patient on other will transfer most often from the nursing staff .
Just , therefore , comes to the hand washing , or carrying of gloves and masks a big meaning to , indeed , there are also in this area considerable defects in the hospitals .
MRSA will transfer by droplet infection or contact , however , in the home hospitals not always exists the possibility to isolate the infected patient .
The rooms are even often overcrowded , the beds briefly are lined up , although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological view .
As Karolina Böröcz further marks , unfortunately , it even happens in the financially less well put hospitals that is saved with disinfectants , there are few orderlies , many patients - all factors which almost favor the origin of infections .
Such infections are far less frequent there as can be proved , or the other spreading of the cause can be detained where these preventive measures are kept , according to Karolina Böröcz .
Government program against MRSA
To gain control of MRSA infections causes to the health insurances huge costs , everywhere , hence , they are fought .
In England the prevention of MRSA , or her containment in the government program became , for example , held on .
After the first signs the program is successful - as published data cover , the trend of the MRSA infections is falling in England .
The European center for illness prevention ( ECDC ) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistant causes ( under it also MRSA ) , as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of his priorities explained .

Arabia arrests in Saudi 208 because of a terror plot

The state television of the world-biggest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets .
Sympathizers of al-Qaeda have begun a campaign against the monarchy which is since 2003 an ally of the United States , as a result of the invasion in Iraq .
A cell of eight militant , stated by a foreign citizen , planned a poster on an oil arrangement in the eastern province , after the television report .
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 strong quick Eingreifstruppe to protect Quaida poster on the world-biggest oil processing arrangement in Abqaiq in 2006 Anlagennach to an unsuccessful Al .
The report , with reference to an innenministerliche explanation , says that 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell which was escorted by a `` rocket expert '' who immigrated illegally to the land .
He reports that the militant had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom .
Other 22 of the imprisoned planned according to the report to kill priests and security forces .

Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are exactly regulated legally , so that the practise of the Umdisponierens of the working days has set up all around the holidays meanwhile , indeed , the next year gives to us less such days .
Also in the EU and in America one understands something else by `` holiday '' .
The Hungarian judicial system makes a distinction between national holidays and work-free days .
Work-free days are mostly ecclesiastical holidays , or stand with significant historical events in connection .
We celebrate , for example , also New Year : The last day of the old , as well as the first day of the new year are work-free days - latter only already with it itself the New Year 's Eve-celebrating can rest .
In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays .
The national holidays are a 15th March which reminds of the revolution of 1848 , and 23rd October , the anniversary of the revolution of 1956 .
20th August the state foundation , on the 1st May the work famedly , will think on the 1st and 2nd November we of our dead people .
In addition , there is two holidays to Easter , Pentecost , and Christmas .
Because our state , national days or religious holidays seldom fall on a week-end , the practise of the `` working day-movement '' plans itself in the cases proves itself in which we would work or after the holiday only one day .
However , the price of the extended week-ends is that we work on Saturdays before it very well , or must go to the school .
When this day which falls before or after the holiday at last should be processed , for long it is fixed by the employment minister in own order .
The statutory regulation counts to all employers and employees , for public employees and official of the civil service equally .
Only companies and equipment in which the company is continued without interruption , thus also in the holidays are excluded .
This year the working rules are mixed up only by the holidays in the end of the year a little bit : In this country from the 24th December the life stops formally , because most for the days between Christmas and New Year 's Eve time balance , or the vacation specially lifted for it take .
Next year more holidays fall in the weekly middle , or on the end of the week , so that there will be less Umdisponierungen , than this year during the working days .
The calendar is put first all around the day of the work `` on the head `` , so that the people immediately four days in the piece can stay at home .
Saturday , 26th April becomes a working day , so that Friday , 2nd May a rest day can be .
The second Umdisponierung hangs together with the holiday on the 23rd October : On Saturday , 18th October one will have to process him Friday , 24th October to begin with .
However , at the end of the year will stand completely in the sign of the holidays , after from the 24th December everything lie and stops , even if New Year 's Eve falls on Wednesday .

It was the day before the Thanksgiving Day as a Ronald Livingston by the big glass window Precisely a Little Healthier restaurants here saw and observed like an ambulance in the white cape Cod two doors further below in the west Scott Avenue stopped .
Soon afterwards was there a police car .
And then was there another .
`` Then I saw the truck of the medical coroner approaching `` , said Livingston , a proctor of the restaurant , on Wednesday .
`` This was the point as me knew that somebody had died. ``
The Behören found out that the dead Mrs. Olga Arroyo , 41 , was , an assistant of the manager of the Newarker police department .
Now the investigators try to find out whether she died because of a procedure which was carried out by a not admitted , cosmetic surgeon whom the police did not identify , and in the house in the west Scott Avenue 212 worked .

Cuba - the nicest island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of the freedom .
What always you expect from your vacation , this will come true if you select only the right thing .
Golden and white beaches , high waves or a sea which is quiet like a pond .
Palms and all Inclusive with the waiters who offer pizza , ice and beguiling cocktails on the beach .
Kitesurfing , gulf and roulette .
On the islands of the Caribbean you find in superabundant measure .
However , only on an island you still find even more , and this island is Cuba , biggest and nicest of the Greater Antilles .
At the moment the Spaniard was Cuba their bastion for the conquest of America .
Columbus called it the nicest place which has seen a human eye .
Once Havana became a camp or transit camp of treasures which had robbed of the Spaniards in America and advanced then to Europe .
And then there came the American epoch .
Hotel Nacional completely originated at the end of the 20-th century .
One of the bosses of the American mafia , Lucky Luciano allowed to build it , because everything what counted in the USA as a crime ( especially during the prohibition ) was seen on Cuba with pleasure and was supported - drugs , game of chance , prostitution .
Among his guests were among other things
Winston Churchill , Ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
In Havana grew blocks of flats , over the wide boulevards the cars which counted to the cult symbols of the fifties of the past Jahrhundets went .
Ernest Hemingway bought to himself a property in San Francisco de Paula , near Havana , and in Cojímar he had his yacht lie .
On the walls of the Bodeguita del midmonth stars of the show business and politicians from completely America left her signatures .
And today ?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph .
At the bar at hotel Nacional one mixes for you cocktails completely by wish .
And the cult cars of the fifties travel around in Havana till this day because the Schigulis imported once and Fiat have broken up in the salty and humid air long time ago .
If Havana , in particular his oldest part , may strongly have come down , one nowhere finds in the vicinity so many miraculous colonial places of interest like exactly here .
Other places are just dressed up , for example , Trinidad .
In regard on the fact that the tourism brings urgently required money there was for this development green light .
During the last fifteen years new hotels have originated not only in Havana , but also in Varadero , on the coast of the province Holguín and also on islet like Cayo Coco , Cayo Guillermo and other .
Cuba offers one more quirk which is unique in the world and draws above all railroad lover .
Steam-pursued and diesel-pursued small-time roads brought the sugarcane of remote plantations to the sugar factories .
Their vehicle park was not renewed for decades , and thus one sees there the comical and fully functioning railroad engines whose contemporaries stand somewhere else for a long time in the museum .
Destinations
The majority of the visitors of Cuba does not let out the bedeutendendsten places .
Thus one must write about Varadero or Havana no more in detail .
Remains only to mention that in the already mentioned property Hemingways a museum is whose visit to itself that which likes this author should not allow to escape .
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba .
The luxuriant vegetation grows in lime ground .
The Mogotas , lime hill and lime rock , rise precipitously from the valley ground , in her hollow cavities fertile ground collected , are covered by the also weather-beaten cliff areas of thick growth .
It is this valley where the maybe best Cuban tobacco is grown .
In his final form you can hit on him if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana .
Possibly it seems to somebody also interesting that there the Chilean result of the TV serial `` major Zeman '' was turned .
Trinidad
An ancient town , briefly , after the Spaniards had settled in the island , was founded .
Fame and wealth brought her trade with slaves and sugar .
The wealth embodied itself in the smart beauty of the small town .
The Spanish colonial architecture , strongly influences from the later French colonists , has barely changed for 400 years .
Trinidad , between the sea and the Escambray mountains situated , is such a backwater that there was there still in the fifties of the last century no street which would have connected the area with the remaining land .
This isolation contributed to the fact that there remained unnoticed .
Nothing was built there , but , therefore , was also torn off nothing , everybody was glad that he had a roof over the head .
If one has time for Trinidad more than one afternoon , it is worthwhile to look at interesting places in the surroundings , as for example the beach Playa Ancón or the `` valley of the sugar factories `` .
Then in the evening one should go to the Casa de la Música which revives after the darkness , and where the music is not quiet up to the morning .
Baracoa
Some call this small town completely in the east of Cuba the nicest one of the island .
Absolutely this view is also influenced by the way there .
Both streets which lead from Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerküftete mountains and run by a scenery which is barely touched by human interventions .
UNESCO took up this eastern outpost of Cuba thanks to the untouched nature there in her world heritage list .
There the best chocolate is produced , in the church one shows the cross of Columbus ( in reality it has originated about hundred years after the journeys of Columbus ) , and several mesas from which El Yunque is the best known one are to be seen by the hill where the former castle , current hotel El Castillo , stands .
About the coffee , the rum , the cigars , the Sierra Maestra mountains , the pork bay and the island Isla de Pinos , about the Tropicana cabaret , the sanctum of Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre , about the Santeria , an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess about all this one could write many sides .
However how one says so : Better with own eyes consider .

In any case , more than 400 guests were loaded to the celebration which is organized in the art industrial museum .

Spanish private transmitter Telecinco doubles for the first time his stock market value and overtakes therefore his rival Antena 3 .
`` Wir have created it. ``
With this sentence the manager of Telecinco , Paolo Vasile , with close of the stock market made known his contentment . The transmitter escorted by him had raised his value by double of his rival Antena 3 .
Nevertheless , an aspect damped his joy : `` Das is exactly that what me is injured ; not that we a higher growth , but that we lower losses had `` , he found out .
He stressed that they have much too deeply sunk in spite of the weak market `` nicht. ``
Yesterday Telecinco finished the day with a plus of 2.54 % .
This profit diminishes his present this year 's losses on 15.66 % .
Now according to Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euros and Mediaset controls the main interest of the capital ( 52 % ) , and Vocento is involved only with 13 % .
Yesterday rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percent points and has to announce since January a loss of a total of 40.5 % , so that his market value with 2,193.46 millions amounts to half .
The market value of other listed communication-enterprises , however , rises ; in case of from Sogecable on 3.571 millions , with Prisa ( publisher of the magazine Cinco Días ) on 2,518.53 millions and with Vocento on 1.779 millions .
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it itself `` um two similar enterprises acts `` , according to Vasile .
Uncertainly still appears the question in which circumference we can operate really technically on the stock exchange for which price and how we can form it at customer level lucratively .
Telecinco explained his plan one week ago to climb up this year to the first television broadcasting station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue . Of this insured Guiseppe Tringali , the managers of Telecinco and Publiespaña , the advertising enterprise of the group .
If the plan should be moved , the transmitter would increase his advertising income in comparison to the 965.4 millions from the year before on 3.6 % .
In the case of Antena 3 the net turnover rose by 1.6 % during the first nine stock market months ( up to 734.4 millions ) , while the Nettoeinkünfte from the television business could show only one increase of 0.7 % ( 630.4 millions ) .
The analysts see the main factor for the stock market course better in the comparison of Telecinco with the high Payout-Ratio which the company could show up to the current time : In 2006 veranlasste the enterprise escorted by Alejandro Echevarría a 100-percent declaration of dividend .
Nevertheless , Vasile assures that the Ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33 % of the shares of Endemol , with Mediaset as a parent company , even if it is still too early for an official announcement .
`` Wir are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50 % of the shares , even if we have bragged up to now always substantially more .
I hope that we can satisfy our stockholders this year whose stock values we could already increase by the purchase of 33 % of the Endemol shares .
At the moment after statement of the analysts the market shows certain loss trends .
Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently his profit calculation with Telecinco for this year about 4 % and for 2009 about 7 % .
This is the result of the shortening of the prospective increase rate which will go back in 2008 from 10.5 % to 8.4 % and in 2009 from 5.5 % on 5.1 % .
This has also lowered the prospective profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 about 4.5 % and for 2009 about 7.5 % .
3 options .
1 .

Budget is by
Yes , it is created .
The budget is approved .
What is in this household a special ?
It is the first household which this government has sketched , and without support of the opposition was accepted by the coalition majority .
For the current year was still approved with support of the ČSSD ( social democrats ) because him minister Sobotka ( from this party ) had presented , and which could not allow itself ČSSD , therefore to reject him .
This time as opposed to lively debate before the vote about the motion of no confidence against the government nothing happened dramatic .
The chamber of deputies approved of this traditionally little notable , still extremely significant law in complete silence .
This is paradoxical as it were .
All governance begins and ends with the single chapters and posts of the household whether that likes or not .
The household is an essential component of the policy , however , is covered by the struggle for power of the government and the opposition .
This is a more thankful subject for the media , and , therefore , they dedicate to him more attention .
A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the general public than sober figures .
The budgets suffered at the past social-democratic governments from three weak points which the household can remove for 2008 not all at once :
The first one is the high interest of issues which oblige for law and it concerns not only the pensions , but also around the social expenses which the `` silent '' coalition from ČSSD and KSČM ( communist ) has decided last year before the choices .
The second one is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point .
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances , i.e . to the budget deficits of the municipalities .
Nevertheless , the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit .
This household is public and eingermaßen under control .
However , a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities .
Many mayors gave to open other springs for investments except income from taxes , deliveries and bank loans , often unthinkingly the debentures from by which they been to blame for her city halls in the excess .
During the last years they succeeded , these debts by plentiful sales of stocks of the energy nets and other supply networks which they had received in the train of the privatisation from the state to pay off .
Now this spring has already dried up .
As far as we keep only to official and checkable facts , we find out , that :
our economy already for some years , like the rest of the world , a growth phase runs through which boasts ČSSD without respite .
This showed a unique possibility for her governments to fix the public finances .
Instead , these governments been to blame for the state , nevertheless , even more .
Other lands , apart from a few exceptions like Hungary , Albania , Pakistan or Egypt , have economized much more rationally than our republic .
This is a gigantic disgrace which is to be ascribed mainly to the earlier governments .
We belong to the lands which , seen in the global graduation , in least by poverty are threatened .
Therefore , no nassiven social programs which were inflated , unfortunately , just during the last years quite superfluous-wise in huge magnitude are necessary .
Even if it has succeeded , a part of the senseless populist issues which were dismissed this year before the choices to glide is clear that if it does not come in the next time for a movement of the pensions entry age and to a pension reform , then any policy ends practically in this land , and , no matter who is in power , nothing but will remain to him pure administering .
It is only easily exaggerated if one says that then from ruling politicians official become who split the biggest part of the inland revenue mechanically on pensions and social expenses .
Therefore , this year 's household can be no revolution , but can order only to the displacement of normal issues by duty expenses stop .
The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion crowns would be absolutely superfluous if earlier governments had not been economical during the last ten years what only went .
If we do not want that it really arrives that from ruling politicians pure administrative official become , then we must be patient and wish this not too strong coalition government which is aware , however , of that that the state can be economical only so much , as he is able to take in taxes and fees , rest by the preparation of other reform laws .
Only these allow a gradual penetration of a well-balanced budget .

With the voters loyal to party the difference precipitates thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates clearly : More than two thirds ( 71 percent ) face to a fifth ( 20 percent ) of approval for the MSZP .
MDF and SZDSZ lie according to survey under the parliamentary entrance hurdle : They come in the whole population on two percent .

The climate on the Venus could give the future of the earth a view let
The Venus was maybe once a pleasant place for the life , scientists said yesterday .
Data of a European spaceship contained on an orbit show that the planet resembles an averted twin of the earth still more than was up to now conscious .
The Venus is the näheste planetary neighbor of the earth .
The two worlds have the same size approximately and have similar orbits of a planet , however , the Venus of the sun is a little nearer .
Before billions of years would have been there on the Venus ' conditions , that would have been very similar to those ones on the earth and would have even habitable can be , scientists believe today .
But because of the unmoderated carbon dioxide greenhouse effect , the Venus broke a very different development course to the erosion of the atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotation speed .
Today the planet of water is robbed and a surface temperature that is hot enough has to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and flash storms .
The findings of the space probe of Venus Express of the European space travel agency that examined the Planten for a year offer a sobering look on that , as the earth in the face of the catastrophic climate changes ' could develop .
Professor Fred Taylor of the department physics at the Oxford university , one of the conductors of the Venus express mission , said : Realizes why the climate is so different on the Venus to that of the earth while the planets are being quite similar otherwise . ''
`` Our new data it facilitates , to construct a scenario in which the Venus began before billions of years as the earth , possibly with one habitable environment . ''

British Bänker plead guilty in the case Enron
Three British bankers that should be put in court by Enron , Andrew Fastow , for their role in the fraudulent system with the former main finance conductor changed on Wednesday their requests in guilty .
David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were open originally for seven cases of fraud by application of tele means of communication for the alleged conspiring with Fastow in a secret finance fraud in the year 2000 in order to enrich at the expense of their employer innocently pleaded .
The procedure had been applied on January .
But during a hearing in court in front of US district judge Ewing Werlein Junior everyone pleaded for a case of fraud guiltily by application of tele means of communication .
The three former managers of Greenwich NatWest , a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC , became known in Great Britain in the course of delivery procedures which lasted two years .
In the United States their case is a rid end of an investigation which was started after Enrons breakdown in 2001 .
The accusations originally submitted against them in the year 2002 made attentive Fastow on his being the objective of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron Niedergang .
The accusation against the bankers - mentioned the `` NatWest Three '' - says they came in the year 2000 to Houston about one fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper hatch .
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership from Enron that was controlled by Fastow that was the architect of innumerable fraudulent Enron-machinations that helped to tear the company into the bankruptcy whirlpool .
At the beginning of 2002 their participation in the subsidiary had estimated the value at zero the bank , but the three British men knew that she had considerable value in reality .
An enterprise under Koppers control acquired the parts of the bank of the subsidiary for 1 million dollars .
The bankers paid Kopper 250.000 dollars for a participation in this enterprise .
According to the accusation Fastow held by mistake that the energy enterprise would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for their parts of the subsidiary opposite Enron .
However , in fact the 20 million dollars went onto the British bankers , Fastow and other ones .
The bankers received 7.3 millions of dollars , during Fastow , Kopper and other about 12.3 millions of dollars absahnten , according to the accusation .
In the January 2004 known Fastow in two charges on conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy guilty .
The British trio was arrested three months later .
Fastow sits out a 6-year long imprisonment in the federal prison of Louisiana .
Kopper sits out a punishment of three years and a month in an equipment in Texarkana .
Each of the three men was on free foot due to one 1 millions of dollars of bail that it required that they lived in the United States in expectation of the legal proceedings .
Enron , once the seventh-greatest enterprise of the nation , crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of bookkeeping tricks could not make more disguise the billion debts longer or appear schwächelnde enterprises profitable .
The breakdown destroyed thousands of jobs , more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars retirement plans from .
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former one executive board chairpersons ' Jeffrey Skilling last year for their roles in connection with the Enron breakdown was condemned to .
Skilling sits out a punishment of more than 24 years .
Lays condemnation for conspiracy , fraud and other charges became vain after he passed away last year because of heart illness .

Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate subjects both the sceptics of the climate change and those ones that put a social and political debate into the foreground concerning that of a merciless criticism , the movement must put than whole a strong cohesion on the day .
Particularly if it is a question of a chief of the movement , which , as in the case of the government president Zapatero , the fight against the climate change for more important holds than the abatement of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests , to sign a new contract with the planet .
This proposal brings it , however , into declaration need concerning the action , and/or non-action of his government which contributed decisively to Spain standing within the EU at the top of the countries which fulfilled the handicaps of the Kioto-protocols most the least .
Who are the persons responsible for the non-fulfilment of the handicaps , to which sectors is this to be put down , and why did his government which had suggested the contract with the planet not stop this development .
In addition it is now forced , the Spanish citizens designated that one from it measures against the climate change without explaining Umschweife .
Which companies will be affected by that , which behavior of the citizens is supposed to be changed , which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and which economical consequences result from that .
More precisely said who must sacrifice himself and will pay himself for the rescue of the planet .
However , it has and none will give to suchdeclarations in future .
Just because it is a question of the Aufopfern and the paying foritself .
Because the measures which can really be used against the climate change are unpopular .
You are costs-rich , uncomfortable and alarming for the accounts of the companies and citizens .
Even the gasoline cent suggested by the PSOE appeared seenly choice-strategically so dangerous to Zapatero that he saw itself forced to take back the proposal again .
Correspondingly it is valid now , the planet with Nothing , to save therefore with pure propaganda and empty sayings without every real consequences .
With impressive statements , commissions , committees , protocols and new offices .
With his contracts with the planet the else politicians , so suitable for choice campaigns , must talk neither , still accuse , still demand , follow the pretentious edition , however , instead of this , to decorate the meetings and to inspire with his gentleness and kindness other .
This can happen , however , only then if the contract does not differ from his nature virtual in that and does not pretend either accordingly that the bike becomes the only moving means in the future or we may refresh ourselves only with a fan .

In the Meantime the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop his colonization works , Bush declared , at which it reminded the two parties of their obligations with regard to the timetable for the peace which these 2003 had agreed to .
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations strive for a peace treaty which is supposed to clarify all open questions without exception , and including the central questions between Israel and the Palestinian authorities among Abbas in the end .
This denomination covers the three serious problems which the quarrels mainly turn around between Israelis and Palestinians : the future borders of Palestine , the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arabian fugitives who were driven out by 1948 of their home which lies in the present State of Israel in the course of the conflict .
After the American president the word caught Abbas and insisted on the coming negotiations comprehensively and thoroughly being led and supplying a regulation in the case of which he counted Jerusalem , the fugitives , the borders , the colonies , water and security among other things for all points .
When Olmert for his part took the word , he signed up , that the coming armistice negotiations directly and without interruption are led and to his making an effort for these being able to be finished still for end 2008 .
Bush has the period of time for the conversion of his vision of two states , one Palestinian and one Israeli , that exist next to each other , defined for end of the year 2008 .
Saudi Arabia disclosed that an assertion received it from Bush in this sense of Bush before it decided on participating in the conference .
Arabia , whose participation represents a great success in Annapolis for Washington , led a plan taken over by all Arabian countries to which Israel offers the peace into the ways in the exchange with his withdrawal from all Arabian fields that had been filled during the war in 1967 , including east Jerusalem .
Annapolis represents a sheath way in the history of the middle Orient , completely especially because it attacks at the roots of the conflict and at his central points of view the Saudi-Arabian prince means in his interview with the arabischsprachigen daily paper financed through Saudi money .

Pains of the Labour-party
Gordon Brown discovered another further pit for the falling in ; his way from this out stays the same one .
For British scandals this is not especially slippery .
No nobility titles seem to have been sucked sold any politician Paris hotel bills pays any extramarital toes .
However the exposure , that a rich businessman Spenden for the British ruling Labour party above more than 650.000 pounds ( 1.3 millions of dollars ) more than four years under the name of other people disguised , and that the party failed to announce this , is something without that that one fought Gordon Brown good would have managed .
When two months ago the Prime Minister had escaped from the demand for a choice , in stupid way the intelligence of the Britons offending when he said that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision there was hope that it would offer a robust , efficient government .
Instead of this as Vince Cable , the representation chairperson of the Liberal democrats astute in increasing measure , expressed it the at one time feared Brown of Stalin to Mr has itself . Bean developed .
The awkward rescue of Northern Rock , a hit bank , regulatorische weakness and bad discernment pointed under bombardment .
Proposals badly thought over for the change of the tax laws set Unternehmensverbände against the government .
The tax-official loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative botches .
A trio of generals retiredly started a revolt in the House of Lords from protest against shortenings of military editions : To be minister of the armed forces , so they claimed , a partial time job is .
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams ; Peter Watt , Labours secretary-general ( and their former fulfillment conductor ) already resigned .
Nothing of that means that Brown breaks direction resignationirrevocably open .
Nevertheless governments can reach a turning point to which they feel impossibly to rule .
Neither like still people trust in politicians , nevertheless they restrain usually their skepticism if a new troop catches the office .
If it is once clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation , and he needs not to be not even long in this case yet , this delay is past : the public service begins to become leaky ; the cabinet ministers begin to chat ; the press searches for bad news ; and the government becomes defensive and aimless .
In a way the position of Brown is especially difficult because he can not say unlike other political leaders to be a new broom .
So with pleasure it Tony Blair would deny , he hisfirst lieutenant was .
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax responsibility documents , for example , love together with decisions that Brown made as a chancellor of the Exchequer .
And even if that one was not directly involved into Blair misfortunes - as to suffice at that one `` money for nobility title '' investigation of political party financing - the voters assume possibly that it was it .
In spite of that situation is not very as bad to Browns as it looks
The misdemeanors are not as terrible as the conservatives describe it .
As at Mr. Bean , nobody died , or was entirely cheated .
And the antidote , painful as it likes to be , is to be delivered , which Browns always promised of course stalinistische tendencies : A reliable , sound one and slightly brutal government .
The new fuss around political donations is a goodexample .
The garböske one Abraham 's , who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts , he says wants no public recognition for his goodwill .
Maybe that likes to be like this , but he was not entitled to thedecision on that .
The laws against anonymity for tall political contributors are clear and they exist for an unequivocal reason : the public has to know a right to who access to those that rule over the country can be bought .
Watt , the says he would have known about Abraham 's agreement , however not , that it is illegal , has to put as a matter of course some questions ' ; exactly as Jon Mendlesohn , Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber , who was told about the strange donations in October .
However , up to now Brown is not shared : There is not anything , that it indicates that that he knew about this confusion although the biggest part of the payments was done after his office takeover in June .
Up to now the prime minister finished half of the work .
He condemned the injury of the laws fast through his party , but it diluted this determination by the reaching after a known instrument , an investigation committee on the topic - led by a bishop retiredly and a judge in order to make the measure full .
`` In This Case '' the `` lessons to be drawn from that are not verycomplicated .
If the law was broken , it is a thing for the police .
Foreseen from that that one gives other things it Mr Brown must do , to find a permanent chairperson for the independent committee for standards in the public life that is vacant since six months as something , and to stride from political party financing ahead with a reform reaching through .
That would require from the hardliners of the Labour to co-operate with the conservatives and to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions possibly - bitter pills for a party comrade as Mr Brown .
But it should be some biased facts conscious .
The conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion polls ; it has to recover two years around voters ; and the only way it can achieve a victory is through incontestable honesty and sound competence .

Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With `` The Hunting Party '' and `` Murderous peace '' two films deal again with Balkan War .
Nevertheless both do not convince .
To set the drafts either to a lot on Action and Geballer or however they are too sentimental .
There also Richard Gere can not help in `` The Hunting Party '' .
The good information first : Indeed the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide still in the mountains of the Balkans , however , calculated there , in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war , the actor Richard Gere was found now .
We had last lost the most beautiful man of the octogenarian years from the eyes because far too many nice-irrelevant roles cured one of the pleasure into feeling well motion-picture work for women and far too many press conferences on the topic Buddhism on seeing .
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument , `` The Hunting party - When the hunter to the Is Hunted ( why film titles must be today actually always so long and confused as train driver wage agreements must ? ) nevertheless maybe to look .
It supplies a representation eye-winking wonderfully : Basically his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become from Gere if the fate and the film branch were not so merciful : A man who has his very best times long behind himself , who , however , still preserved considerable residues of the former charm even as a ruin-same monument of his downfall .
But in spite of this trump `` The Hunting Party '' continues together with the German production `` Murderous peace '' , that starts also in this week , only the endless row of failed Balkan War films .
With `` Murderous peace '' one can do short process : The film acts from two German soldiers in Kosovo ( Adrian Topol , Max Riemelt ) who save a Serb from kosovarischen snipers , on which one falls with them in love promptly also still .
Although it is acclaimable , that here once not the Serbs as an only root of all evil are represented , the fernsehflache film disappears far too quickly in Geballer and Action .
A kind remains `` Alarm for Cobra 11 '' without motorway but for thatwith war .
On the other hand it can be investigated at `` The Hunting Party '' almost exemplarily why actually there has never yet been a correctly good Balkans war film .
The history of three US war reporters that prepare themselves in order to trace the Serbian upper war criminal `` the fox '' could have become maybe a new `` Apocalypse Now '' with another director and another scriptwriter ( both in personal union Richard Shepard ) at another time .
Because the stories resemble themselves really remarkably : To go both Male small teams into the forest , in order to achieve something , what the militaries not can and both Male it becomes a journey into the madness .
One of the reasons for the failure of `` The Hunting Party '' is , that one of Simon Hunt not simple the cynic come down with heart be lets , when that it us at the beginning is imagined .
No , the script must impute on top of that still a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to him .
Finally `` The Hunting Party '' goes then the creek under that , if the reporters succeed in what Nato , CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years did not create within the last five minutes in the quick-motion procedure : The war criminal catch and to the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge leave .
That is so bad that one would like to call the International court of justice in The Hague because of crimes against the cinema logic .
In this case the film has a most deeply human request .
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic run still freely , and he suspects the Americans and the French ( here they are supposed to be by way of exception once agreed ) not to practice the pursuit far too intensely due to secret political agreements .
But the well-meant one and the evil are sometimes so similar themselves that a famous Brecht-Gedicht comes to one into the sense .
In that it is called above the wooden mask of an Asiatic demon on the workbench of the poet : `` I see the swollen forehead veins compassionate , pointing out : hard how being bad is '' .
Films as `` The Hunting Party '' have exactly such a swelling-head that , however , pointing out is as hard , good to be .
The problem is not restricted on the genre of the Balkan Warfilm .
Is recent in this newspaper tells become , that all Iraq films Hollywoods were big flops .
One can add : There has never also yet been a good South Africafilm .
Almost always is valid : If a star hangs around on the crisis-breeding elements or mine fields of the world , something like that comes in this case then from that as `` Rangoon '' with Patricia Arquette , `` Beyond all borders '' with Angelina Jolie or `` blood diamonds '' with Leonardo DiCaprio .
Possibly all the conflicts are within a given time simply still toonear .
It had to pass by after all decades before to Hollywood with `` Schindlers Liste '' could shoot a good film about the holocaust .
Some film will presumably still mature - the Vietnam works `` The Deer Hunter '' , `` Apocalypse Now '' or `` Full Metal Jackett '' being regarded as classics now were not celebrated at that time really by any means as masterpieces unanimous .
But maybe we know today , where every mass murder in real time comes on now two screens at home , also simply too much about the conflicts of the world .
And that robs the screenplay writers of the Bedenkenlosigkeit who needs it in order to tell good histories .
`` Existence or nonexistence '' or Really finally became `` the tall dictator '' as well also therefore because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet as in fact badly the Nazi regime was there .
Maybe one must not want to be good if one wants to make goodfilms .
Maybe one must have the sarkastisch distanzierten artist look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk .
As that to parallels between his historical novel `` Lemprières dictionary '' and Balkan War was questioned , he answered : `` That is due only to some things being never changed .
Cities will be always terribly dangerous , people will always be murdered in dreadful way and always there will be war in Yugoslavia . ''

Bulgaria is currently without a doubt the most sought after plaster for immovable purchases in the East European room , with favorable ski studio apartments and houses at the sea .
Between the mountains the regions Bansko , Borovec , Pamprovo and Vitosa number among the most popular , at the sea Albena , the `` gold coast '' , the `` sun coast '' , and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar are the runners , however , immovables are asked to more ever around Kavarna and Balcik .
To attract investors according to assessments of Re/Max analyst in Bulgaria wid also the inland sooner or later , so for example Veliko Tarnovo , Gabrovo , Elena , and Triavna , and also the distinctly favorable area of Russe records more buyers .
The capital Sofia offers also enticing offers - commercial and office faces offer highest net yields .
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradises , and to attract tourists thus next to the summer and winter season also in the two other seasons .
Foresighted investors shop therefore already now in the great style , for example around Bansko .
According to analysts people who acquire immovables in Bulgaria strive also for a change of their conduct .
Most buyers are English , also prospective customers come , however , from France , Belgium , Spain , and more and more from Romania .
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present while there are being mainly Russian buyers near the Black Sea and in the ski fields .
There are three groups of foreign buyers , Georgij Jankov , regional director of Re/Max Bulgarien , says .
Those that want to sit down either revitalisierte immovables buy euro , or houses come down around 5-15.000 around 50-100.000 euro , that renovate it then themselves .
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication options are written in a large way , but also the proximity to a city , businesses and doctors are decisive for the buyers .
Those appertain to the second category , who are in search of a vacation residence ( Bulgaria was listed in December under the top Ten Urlaubszielen of the Germans ) .
Businessmen define the third group , that with the objective of one middle- to long-term accretion invest .
Meanwhile immovables in the capital become constantly more expensive , necessitated by the always wachsende demand .
Within the EU the immovable prices are lowest indeed in Bulgaria , in the last five years there was a price increase , however , around annual 21 percent .
The price increase with the immovable prices exceeds the increase of the salaries by far .

In many places disinfectants are economized on
Became wage more than a thousand infections in hospitals that were to be put down to an inappropriate contact with antibiotics registers .
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals , the overcrowding of the beds , the overload of the personnel - everything factors , that the embankment of the infections not just zuträglich are , so the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center .
In many places people save also near the disinfectants .
In the traumatology-department of the János hospital a MRSA-infection was diagnosed recently .
The bacterium resistant against antibiotics was found in a masculine patient who was hospitalized after a hard accident .
The patient was isolated .
At the beginning of the year there was here already a similar infection .
The injured person of a hard car accident was released from the hospital , little later the man had to return , however , with a MRSA-infection . An important operation could not be carried out since then because of the bacterium which is still in the body of the patient yet .
Until 10th December of this year 1094 infections activated by multiresistant exciters onto the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System were announced from hospitals , according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center , Karolina Böröcz .
So many , infections activated by multiresistant exciters were registered in the hospitals therefore with security , the darkness digit might be , however , higher .
About two thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) were activated to that from the MRSA against Methicillin-Oxacillin of resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
The Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) bacterium bears about a third of the people in their nose without its causing an illness .
SA-conditional infections ( as about inflammation of the throat , tonsillitis , inflammations of the skin or wounds ) react mostly well to antibiotics , they are well curable .
The means are proportioned , however , too highly or used inappropriately , arise from the well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics-resistant , that expand quickly under corresponding conditions in the hospitals .
In particular with patients with immune system weakened , or functioning badly permanently , however also in older , or patients with small body weight can these bacteria difficult infections , as for instance wound infection or blood poisoning , that is sepsis , cause .
According to the medical conductor of the János hospital the MRSA-infection is not anything special , such incidents appertain to the sick person house everyday life .
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic , manhte Tibor Nyulasi - there are not MRSA only over there , where it is not searched .
Resistant against antibiotics
`` Such patients are isolated , the nursing staff bears rubber gloves and masks during the supply , and we have the antibiotics , necessary for the treatment , '' - so Tibor Nyulasi .
With their admission into the hospital the patients are examined indeed for MRSA , nevertheless an infection can always not be avoided .
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections activated by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable , however , the conditions currently being there and circumstances are unfavorable for the embankment of the origin or the spreading of the multiresistant exciter , Karolina Böröcz says .
After this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and homes for the elderly , the taken patients should examine the hospitals and MRSA-infected immediately isolate .
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not practised , however , so frequently .
Last but not least because it vonseiten the state health insurance no subsidies for this investigation gives .
Most cases would not come to light before then therefore if the patient has already a noticeable MRSA-infection , according to the medical head of the epidemiology center .
There are strict recommendations for the corresponding application of antibiotics to Vonseiten of the European Union in the humane medicine , there are , however , guidelines also in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures .
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be precise , that is , microbiological investigations are necessary so that no resistance to the means can form itself , however , this directive is not always kept by hospitals either .
Among the itinerant ones , or themselves in the basic supply of contained patient microbiological sampling are even even rarer , so Karolina Böröcz .
People save near the disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is transmitted on the other one by the nursing staff from a patient most frequently .
Just therefore the manual washing , or the carrying of gloves and masks are of a great importance , however , there are also on this field considerable shortcomings in the hospitals .
MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact , in the domestic hospitals always the possibility to isolate the infected patient does not exist , however .
The rooms are even often full , the beds just at each other follow , although there should be a distance of at least 1,5 meters between them from epidemiological view .
As Karolina Böröcz keeps on saying , it happens unfortunately in the financially less well set hospitals even that near disinfectants saves there are few nurses , many patients - everything factors that almost favor the origin of infections .
Such infections are nachweislich far less frequent there , and/or the further circulation of the exciter , where these protective measures are kept to can be stopped , according to Karolina Böröcz .
Government program against MRSA
Therefore agreeing with MRSA-infections into the grip causes enormous costs to the health insurances they are combated everywhere .
In England for example the prevention of MRSA , and/or their embankment was held in the government program .
According to first signs the program is successful - as published data prove , the tendency of the MRSA infections is regressive in England .
The European center for illness prevention ( ECDC ) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistant exciters ( under that also MRSA ) , as soon as the prevention of infections declares as one of his priorities in hospitals .

My family doctor presents one of his long , strange research articles with the title to me : Money leads to activation of certain brain fields , particularly , if the other ones get more from that .
Therefore the feelings arising through the monthly payment of salary are dependent on the content of the colleagues .
The study was created with the aid of a tomographisch-magnetic reference analysis at the Bonn university , and the results were published in the last edition of the science-magazine Science .
According to statement of Bernd Webers , author of the study and director of the Bonner brain research center Life & Brain , the activation was then strongest if the participant gave correct answers and on the other hand his other player failed .
The researchers could recognize that the brain activities always very much moderat turned out if both participants with their answer were correct and got also the same salary accordingly ; but if one of them received the double one , it resulted also in a stronger brain activity .
I am not sure to myself , whether in fact it requires so much scientific expenditure to reach for such a result .

The choice of the Status Quo
On Sunday it will not become with the counting of the urns thrilling : The mass of the Russians will decide for president of Putins party , United Russia .
After an election campaign very sealed off she confirms their aspiration to stability , yes even according to authoritarianism .
Three days in front of the parliament choices the Russian president Wladimir Putin addresses an information broadcast on the public senders to the voters that already indeed was recorded , that contents , however , are kept a secret .
He does this in his property as a top candidate of the United Russia , the pros-Kremlin-party for which an overwhelming victory announces itself .
Yesterday the president did not make anything look through when he received the foreign ambassadors , and gab zufrieden with supplying a new target against the western powers , accused that of the interference werden- his darling topic during the election campaign .
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest , extremely transparent and open choices , choices without trickery , he added .
From view of the opposition they vertan themselvesthere .
They prangert an election campaign stained throughsuppression .
The communist leader Günnadi Ziouganov does not say there would never have been such dirty choices even in the time of Eltsin .
According to the suppression of the demonstrations at the last weekend , is valid for ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder for unauthorized demonstrating to five days of custody , according to his attorney furthermore visit prohibition had been condemned .
The Russians preserved the mentality of the homo Sovieticus
After these parliament choices without tension two a lot weiterführende questions raise themselves :
Who will enter upon Putins succession as a president ?
The office newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first ballot of the premiership choices , the 2nd March 2008 ; the candidates familiarized oneself until the 23rd December time .
Since it was chosen in 2000 and chosen in 2004 again , Wladimir Putin can not line up for a third mandate in consequence .
And now no successor finds himself .
Which role will play Putin after March ?
Prime minister ?
Chairpersons ' of the parliament majority and the omnipotent party United Russia , the government and president will select ?
Whatever it will be , at the Parliament- or at the premiership choices , the previous power will triumph .
That is tradition .
The Russians preserved the mentality of the homo Sovieticus , they are not gentleman of their fate , the sociologist Lev Goudkov , director of the Independent Center Levada , thinks .
The Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the St. Petersburg State University goes back even still further : The middle class society weiterentwickelt in this country which was christianized five centuries to Europe only very much slowly ; the famous esprit de corps delayed the development of individuality .
After the liberal reforms of the nineties Putin picked up the model of a paternalistic state again , which was completely accepted by the population , all the more more , there on this new paternalism 's no terror followed , but a certain economical prosperity , Maria Lipman of the Carnegie donation means .
Today the Russians renounce from free pieces the personal responsibility which they laid on the day according to the decay of the USSR on a short-term basis .
To which still long held over ?
This phenomenon affects all social classes , including the business world .
And the administration elite understands to hold the Status Quo : 65 governors ( of 85 Russian region chairpersons ) lead the local choice lists of the United Russia .
The freedoms new , coming from the west are often tantamount to chaos , as in the nineties .
The general public prefers stability .
In this sense the Russians will not vote either for the extremist parties .
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko , a 54-year old professor : To which still long held over ?
Those ones that are at the power are not so bad , why they pay off ?

Budget is through
Yes , it is created .
The national budget is approved of .
What is special one at this budget ?
It is the first budget which this government projected , and which was accepted without support of the opposition through the coalition majority .
The for the current year the SSD ( Social democrats ) was still approved of with support because minister Sobotka had presented it ( of this party ) , and the SSD could not allow it therefore to refuse it .
Unlike the lively debate in front of the vote about the motion of no confindence against the government nothing dramatic happened this time .
The parliament approved of this traditionally few paid attention to , nevertheless highly important law calmly .
That is in a way paradoxical .
All governance begins and ends with the single chapters and posts of the budget , whether one likes that or not .
The budget is an essential component of the politics , is concealed , however , by the power fight of the government and the opposition .
That is a more thankful topic for the media , and therefore they dedicate more attention to it .
A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober numbers are .
The national budgets suffered from three weak points that the budget can not remove for the year 2008 at the same time near the last social-democratic governments :
The first is the high part of editions , that are of because of law obliging , at which it is not a question only of the pensions , but also around social expenditures which the `` silent '' coalition of SSD and KSM ( Communists ) in the last year in front of the choices decided on .
The second is the defizitäre budget policy as a consequence of the first weak point .
The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances , that is the budget deficits of the municipalities .
The greatest risk is not , however , the state budget deficit .
This budget is public and eingermassen under control .
A true time bomb is , however , the budget deficit of themunicipalities .
Many mayors often distributed debentures through which their city halls caused it in the excess in order to develop further sources from taxes , deliveries and bank loans except for gains for investments without careful consideration .
In the last years they succeeded in it , these debts through massive sale of stocks the Energy- and other supply networks ' that they had received in the course of the denationalization of the state pay off .
Now this source already versiegt .
As far as we stick only to official and nachprüfbare facts , we find , that :
our economy already since some years , as the rest of the world , a growth phase which the SSD incessantly boasts about ran through .
That represented a unique possibility for their governments to sort out the public finances .
Instead of this these governments got into debt the state , however , still more .
Other countries , foreseen from a few exceptions as Hungarians , Albania , Pakistan or Egypt , managed much more reasonable than our republic .
That is a giant disgrace which is mainly to be ascribed to the former governments .
We belong to the countries which are threatened , seen , least from poverty in the global standard .
Therefore no nassiven social programs which were blown up unfortunately just in the last years very superfluously in gigantic scale are necessary .
Even if has succeeded in deleting a part of the senseless populistischen editions that were adopted this year in front of the choices , is clear , that if it does not come in next time for a shift of the pension entry age and for a pension reform , then virtually any politics in this country , and , very now who is at the power ends , he will not have anything as a pure administration .
It is only easily exaggerated if one says that officials that divide up the biggest part of the tax yields mechanically on pensions and social expenditures become then from ruling politicians .
Therefore the this year 's budget can not be a revolution , but it can stop only the displacement of normal editions through duty editions .
That for 2008 designated deficit of 70 billion crowns would be absolutely superfluous , if former governments had not distributed in the last ten years , which only worked .
If we do not want pure administration officials to become from ruling politicians that in fact it results in that , we must be patient then and this coalition government not far too strong , that it is conscious of that that the state can issue only as much as it is to charm in the situation at taxes and fees rest during the preparation of further reform laws want .
Only these facilitate a step-by-step enforcement of a harmonious national budget .

You used also cardiac massages , however futile .
I will not permit that it is said the police forces would not have given the young people any help .
One gave these young people first help .
The fire department came immediately .
It was done everything in order to attempt to save it , the state attorney stressed for her part .

British army recruits on YouTube
Units of the British army published photos about operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan for the purpose of popularity increase on the video portal .
First of all the British air force ( RAF ) discovered YouTube for itself : Special units stationed in Afghanistan load since March 2006 videos about operations led against the Taliban into the net , the BBC tells .
The photos turned with miniature cameras attached on helmets are controlled at the air force foothold in Kandahar and sent then to London , where they are put into the Internet .
Political message unavoidable
Soldiers of the air force contributed in already 139 such photos , was had at their `` channel '' a look more than 75.000 times .
The British Ministry of Defense became under `` defenceheadquarters '' in the spring 2007 also the British Department of State ( Commonwealth Office ) registers in order to publish videos , however , about Iraqi and Afghan operations and the international peace troops stationed in Iraq ( MNFI ) have own YouTube channels .
Use in Afghanistan
Originally the air force recruited the videos with the objective soldiers , publishes , and as the Ministry of Defense says , the contributions serve also the purpose for informing the population of the actual objectives of the foreign actions .
Such kind 's published propaganda is almost free in comparison with traditional television commercials , according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC , however , these videos always take a certain measure of political message into themselves since they confirm the right to exist of the military measures decided on by the government in own way .
Recruiting Americans with game
The army must fight , however , also against amateur photos that get it also into the net next to the carefully dealt , zensurierten photos - as about such that show the death of the soldiers : In the a little hypocritical , `` official '' propaganda films talks about the losses at most , the bloody pages of the war are not shown , however .
From the theaters of war in Iraq and in Afghanistan after all already numerous videos turned in the use were loaded onto the platform , the Britons discovered this `` type '' only recently , however , for themselves .
Meanwhile the Americans recruit in the a little different way , indeed with the freely herunterladbaren firing-game `` America 's Army '' in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier within the framework of a more or less life-loyal simulation .

Bono declares itself , the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo understood and , trap of a choice victory , to accept in the congress .
The former defense minister José Bono accepted the offer of the government president and secretary-general of the socialists , José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero . Accordingly he will lead the list of the PSOE candidates at the coming general choices in Toledo and , in the case of a choice victory of the socialists , the office of the congress president take over .
So it of José Blanco announced to organization secretary of the PSOE , and Bono in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero occurred today in the head office of the party .
In the view of the head of the government the offer is onto the former minister justified since it is important in the politics to be able to count on the best and is Bono among the best .
In addition the politician coming from the Mancha would run in the case of a victory for the socialists at the coming choices according to all appearance as a chairperson of the congress for the party .
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as a congress president . This had announced on the last 15th one November not to enter upon more at the next general choices , to end his career in the public politics and to support the climate protection instead of this in the on-campus field .
The former minister had to admit that the government president would have insisted on the political event continuously since his resignation two years ago onto his return .
Furthermore it referred to who would take over the post of the congress president in the case of a choice victory not wanting to withhold the party from the citizens , as with the appointment of the vice-president for economy , and referred to this as an act of the transparency .
If it should take over the office in fact , he hopes so the chamber into a house the respect 's and not the insult 's or the yelling 's to convert in order to make her appear so increasingly more similar to the citizens .
Unfortunately one gains from time to time the impression as if the single place in which one can not talk in Madrid quietly and calmly were the congress ; so the government president was interrupted in the senate once up to 26 times .
Simultaneously he praised the current president Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out , it does not want to raise the appearance to already have taken over the office since otherwise his political opponents would refer to this as arrogance .

The self turned 30-Sekunden-videos that internet users submitted via Youtube are not hardly more than keyword donors .

Does an Endjahres-Rally await the stock exchange ? Disagreement with the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just five weeks up to the annual account at the stock exchange the investors abrade themselves already the hands with regard to the coming Endjahres-Rally .
Nevertheless the experts can not create any securepredictions concerning that .
Banif believes that in that statistically considers the month of December at the stock exchange usually with a positive market trend goes around
Nonetheless it is not advisable , predictions short-term and to construct only on the basis of statistics . Particularly then not , when serious tensions to be taken determine the current market event
Although other experts approve one such a strong course rise in the last weeks of the year not , nevertheless these say that the stock market price is designated by that one givenly liquidity of the market and the market participants . These invest due to the lack secure common stock fund main in bond funds that is there to productive capital values strongly affected by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend .
Accordingly the stock exchange will rather show in opinion of these experts a course trend rather lateral , influenced from market fluctuations particularly because we can not estimate the scales of the possible drop of the interest rate of the US issuing bank yet , to take back an insecurity that one before all onto the climbed crude oil price and the danger of the rise of the inflation rate is .
Javier Barrio , chairperson of the sales department at BPI in Spain , agrees with it being a risky time to announce an imminent Markt-Rally .
The chances do not stand very good , the expert assures .
The Spanish share index Ibex already since his Höchstmarke on the 8th November of 15.945,7 points lost a value of 4 % .
But not all experts divide the same negative opinion .
According to opinion of Juan Solana , analyst at Intermoney , the Ibex 35 due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the Bezuschussung of the pension fund traditional , carried out every year around this time could close the year successfully with almost 16.000 points .
Nevertheless the expert emphasizes that this year the things could develop something to themselves differently ; particularly due to that already in the second December week , and accordingly directly after the bridge day to the day of the constitution , occurring Endjahres-Rally .
In the view of the analyst the price fluctuations would not influence the market trends .
According to assessment of Federico Olucha , analyst near the bank Inversis , the previous judgments for the market are on an almost technical level , which could result in a deviation from the index values that scales depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis being able soon to emerge .
The analyst trusts in these turning out positively .
During the selection of the values which are supposed to drive forward the Ibex to new maximums the analysts agree agreed to themselves .
Solana of Intermoney declares that this year it is up to the big values .
The expert would belong the two big banks and some immovable societies to the value-winners since the stream sector to the given time will be too expensive .
Meanwhile Federico Olucha of the bank Inversis assures that the rises will be accompanied in connection with the bank and industry sector .
If the Rally happens in fact , the immovable societies will profit by it .
The ACS was in the last months on catching course and we hope for other immovable societies as Ferrovial and FCC taking the same way , according to the expert .
With regard to the increased consumer behavior during Christmas Day the periodic consumption will determine the market event In the last year half .
On the other hand the expert believes that also the technologies will achieve positive sales results himself if they are represented on the Spanish market only in small number .
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years December showed only in two cases sinking course courses .
When at the end of 2003 the technology-bubble burst , this led the stock exchange from their crisis and the up to now last real final year rallye initiated simultaneously .
This year in which the Ibex 35 caught up around 28,17 percent points December showed a course rise of 6,68 % .
Whether in 2008 the fifth profitable year becomes in consequence ( the Ibex climbs since January around 8,36 % ) and can show also an Endjahresrally will be proved .

The harmonized consumer price index ( VPI ) increased in November around five tenths and is now near 4,1 % .
The indicator , the euro action to the the judgment of the inflation rate within the European Union serves , the average price development occurred in Spain in November delivers .
His publication corresponds to the basic principles of euro action and to the European central bank ( EZB ) that strives through the announcement of the data for a local and quality comparison to US products .
The prediction for the indicator can be created early when one uses the same procedure as with the harmonized consumer price index , but he uses various other statistical modelling concepts simultaneously still around those to the time of the calculation information not available estimate .
The Spanish statistics office ( INE ) admonished , however , that the early determined indicator is used only as a standard value , and does not have to agree with the final result that is announced on the coming 14th one December therefore .

According to statement of the deputy head of the government and the economic and finance minister Pedro Solbes , if the rise of the VPI is a temporary development in November ; simultaneously this assured that the price index would keep on remaining in the coming months on a relatively high level .

The hospital offers at the most 200000 for every parent pair .
The legal representative of the hospital , Ondej Dostál , does absolutely not agree therefore agreed with the proposal Velebas .
`` We refuse such a proposal , it is too high around a multiple '' , Dostál said after the present negotiations .
`` In order to be able to form ourselves an opinion on this counterproposal , however , we need the expert opinion , which the opposite side made create .
We will find out whether actually it has statement value .
We insist , however , on the opinion , that that for all should lie together in the a hundred thousand heir-rich '' , emphatical Dostál .
The amount should move it according to between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents .
At the beginning the family wanted a million crowns from Jabloov for every month which she their biological daughter had not pulled up .

The parents of the children suffered psychological damages and stress symptoms in different strength and depth in the view of specialists from the field of psychology and psychiatry .
The men took the stress-situation better even if they saw themselves opposite reproaches , they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns .

The courts granted custody of concerned person up to now comparably low compensation sums , the amounts were determined through tables and they moved in the field from a hundred dew sending , by way of exception of millions .

Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is in fact an island of the freedom .
What you always expect of your vacation , that will be fulfilled if you select only the correct thing .
Golden and white beaches , high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond .
Including palms and space with waiters that offer pizza , ice and beguiling cocktails at the beach .
Kitesurfing , golf and roulettes .
On the islands of the Caribbean you find that in overabundant measure .
Only on an island you find , however , still many more , and Cuba , the largest and most beautiful of the Big Antilles , is this island .
In the Spaniards ' times Cuba of those ones was bastion for the conquestof Americas .
Kolumbus mentioned it the most beautiful place which ever a human eye saw .
Havana became once a warehouse or transit camp of treasures which had stolen the Spaniards in America and transported the Spaniards to Europe then .
And then the American epoch came .
The hotel Nacional completely arose at the end of the 20th century .
One of the heads of the American Mafia , Lucky Luciano , made him be uplifted , because all that was regarded as a crime in the USA ( especially during the prohibition ) became on Cuba most welcome and supplementary - drugs , gambling , prostitution .
Among his guests were among other things .
Winston Churchill , Ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
Into Havana high-rise buildings increased , over the wide boulevards cars that numbered among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last Jahrhundets drove .
Ernest Hemingway bought himself an estate in San Francisco de Paula , near Havannas , and in Cojímar he had his yacht lie .
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio stars of the show business and politicians from whole America left behind their signatures .
And today ?
At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana also you can leave behind your autograph .
At the bar in the hotel Nacional one mixes cocktails very asrequired for you .
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana until today because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salty and moist air fell apart a long time ago .
Havana , in particular his oldest part , likes to have come down strongly , nowhere one does not find as many wonderful colonial sights here in the vicinity as just .
Other places are just herausgeputzt , for the example Trinidad .
In regard on the tourism bringing urgently needed money there was for this development green light .
In the last fifteen years new hotels did not arise only in Havana , but also in Varadero , at the coast of the province Holguín and also on islets as Cayo Coco , Cayo Guillermo and other .
Cuba offers another whim which is unique on the world and attracts particularly railroad lovers .
Steam and diesel-practiced narrow gauge railways brought the sugar cane of remote plantations to the sugar works .
Your vehicle fleet was not renewed over decades , and one sees like this there locomotives droll and functioning fully whose contemporaries stand somewhere else in the museum for a long time .
Places of excursions
The majority of the visitors of Cuba does not let out thebedeutendendsten places .
So one does not have to write about Varadero or Havana morefully .
It remains only to mention that there is a museum whose visit that one that likes this writer should not be able to escape in the already mentioned estate Hemingways .
The Viñales-valley in the west of the island is one of the mostpicturesque angles of Cuba .
The opulent vegetation grows onto lime ground .
The Mogotas , lime hill and rock , rise steeply from the valley , in their cavities fertile ground through which also weather-beaten rock fields of thick vegetation are overcast was collected .
It is this valley where the maybe best Cuban tobacco is built on .
In his final form you can stumble on it if you go to one of the cigar factories of Havana .
Possibly it seems to some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV series `` Major Zeman '' was turned there .
Trinidad
An ancient city which was set up shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island .
The trade with slave and sugar brought her fame andfortune .
The fortune embodied itself in the neat beauty of the smallcity .
The Spanish colonial architecture , strongly influenced by the later French colonizers , has hardly changed since four hundred years .
Trinidad , sited between the sea and the Escambray-mountains , is a so remote place that there was not over there any street that would have connected the area with the remaining country yet in the fifties of the last century .
This isolation contributed to its remaining unseen .
Nothing was built there , not torn down , however , therefore also anything , it was glad to everyone that he had a roof above the head .
If one has more than one afternoon time for Trinidad , then it is worth to look at interesting places in the surroundings as about the beach playa Ancón or the `` valley of the sugar works '' .
At the evening one should go into the Casa de la Música that livens up according to the darkness then and where the music is not silent up to the morning .
Baracoa
Completely to describe this small town in the east of Cuba some as the most beautiful of the island .
Certainly this opinion is influenced also by the way there .
Both streets which lead from Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerküftete mountains and run through a landscape which is hardly affected from human interventions .
UNESCO received this eastern outpost of Cuba thanks to the nonlocal unchanged nature into their world heir list .
There the best chocolate is manufactured , in the church one shows the cross of Kolumbus ( in reality it arose about a hundred years after the journeys of Kolumbus ) , and from the hill , where the former castle , the present hotel El Castillo , stands , several mesas from which El Yunque is the best known are to be seen .
Over the coffee , the rum , the cigars , the Sierra-Mästra mountains , the pig bay and the island Isla de Pinos , about the Tropicana cabaret , the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre , about the Santeria , an African religion which the descendants of slaves stand up for , over all that could write one many pages .
However , as one says so : Looking better with own eyes .

New apprehensions above natural gas quarrel between Russia and Ukraine
A new price quarrel smolders between Ukraine and Russia , which increases the danger that Russian exports of combustible are influenced to Western Europe .
The biggest part of the Russian natural gas exports into the European Union ( EU ) is led through Ukraine and every quarrel between the two nations is observed very exactly .
Kiev warned , that if Moscow increases the price that it must pay for the natural gas , it of Russia higher transit fees into account will put .
A former conflict between the two states in the last year reduced deliveries into the EU-states .
The recent quarrel between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time at which the Ukrainian government and the Russian , state gas monopoly Gazprom attempt to achieve an agreement how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in the year 2008 .
According to Gazprom more must be charged Ukraine since the company group arranged up to 50 % to pay for natural gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan .
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40 % more for the imports of Gazprom .
`` It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states at conversations '' , the economic minister of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh the news agency of Reuters said .
`` The natural gas prices changing themselves should be combined beyond doubt with our arguments concerning the height of the transit fees [ to Western Europe ] about Ukraine . ''
In the last great natural gas quarrel between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 Gazprom shortened deliveries into Ukraine .
This led to consequence for a case of the exports to Western Europe , which pushed up the prices drastically .
A quarter of the supply of the European Union forms Russian gas .
Russia has the worldwide greatest gas occurrences , but a lot of that remains underdeveloped .
The consequence is that Gazprom complements his own inventory with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations .

Six quenching trifles , in order to annoy colleagues
E-mails which we forget to send , voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that do not strike us anymore at all : You bring `` color '' into the everyday life at the job .
The question whether one becomes accustomed to these small inconveniences is bare or one is confronted better with the challenge and attempts these misleading , for other annoyed situations consciously too vermweiden .
Tips .
`` Sorry , I forgot to tell you that somebody of the marketing department called - a colleague says '' .
That one missed a meeting through that ?
At best one regrets it and attempts to make up again when maybe one phones the marketing department and confesses remorsefully one would have forgotten , to achieve the information ( that is that one little usual method ) .
Mostly the thing with an excuse is laughed away .
Before one involves oneself in embarrassing excuses , one should consider , with which one can truly prepare unpleasant moments for his colleagues and attempt to avoid these situations consciously .
A little borrowed , which does not belong to one even ?
There is not hardly a little Pithier than if one grasps a document , office accessories , or the telephone nevertheless it is not there .
Yesterday the notebook device still lay on the desk - it is today earlyaway ?
Or that one is lost believed ball-point pens discovered for instance on the desk of a colleague ?
Without one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow , because they are annoyed that something disappeared if they find .
Therefore , no envelopes or Post-its from the office put into the bag , because it could affect one even : no one more there , if nevertheless man 's needs urgently .
Getratsche about the private life of the colleagues ?
There is not any effective means to stop a gossip which already was started .
Who with whom , done something ?
Where and why ?
One should not tie the information ( or supposition ) about the private life of the colleagues as far as possible to everyone to the nose !
And if nevertheless somebody opens for himself and his innermost secret betrays us , we should not misuse this confidence !
Best one keeps quiet as a grave , instead of that just not person presents to adjust even if other know also answer about the problems of the colleague .
Without reason in a sick way announced ?
If one calls in the office in order to answer under appointment on tormenting headaches in a sick way because one just feels uneasy , or only simply liked to take a rest , one should realize one thing : The own work , unaufschiebbare Erledigungen , the colleagues must finish projects with fixed appointments now instead of one even .
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore !
If one knows already on day before that one will not get it into the office on the next day , or that something could get in the way , for which one must stay at home , one should announce it in time , in this way neither the colleagues , to be confronted still the head unexpectedly with the absence .
Gesumme , giggle , making a call
One is hollow just in his work , is disturbed , however , suddenly from the loud giggle of the colleagues ?
Overheard unintentionally a telephone conversation , which one should not have heard better ?
One should say the colleagues not with sums , singing , conversations ( that one leads over their heads ) , trample , permanent chiding or moaning irritate .
That all can be very much bothering also if they are not hollow just in a task ( to write people organize people plan ) .
Are always the other ones guilty ?
A project is not period of time-raked ready , one has an important letter or forgotten important Nachrichte to send , one should not search the fault of the own forgetfulness at other !
As far as possible one should not talk out onto the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues !
Best one admits his errors , and apologizes if other were affected also by that !
The question how one can make up for the error again , or make up for the missed thing is only far too made !
In the office - a feeling as at home ?
Tracksuit bottoms and Schlapfen : Force for at home , nothing lost , however , in the office !
Not even then one should dress so leger if the job approved it actually !
Only not to become too slovenly - one should both his colleagues , than also themselves even so far respect , that one dresses in according to the office - if desired , also pretty and elegant !

The bank consortium BBVA , who repeats also the prolongation of their opening times in the subsidiaries announce lies , did not take up to now yet any definitive decision .
The at the time of current negotiations of the bank with the trade unions to seem to aim at an agreement in the case of which 75 % of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for that on a weekday in the afternoon when neither for the custom .
Whether further banks follow the new initiative which adapts itself to the business opening times will depend on the empirical values of the Popular Bank .

It is objective to prolong the opening times of those branches which can capture the custom of independent , small and located centrally enterprises inclined to buy , but also the one of big department stores due to their situation .
The bank would like to open the new 200 branches in the course of the coming 18 months , there it not around new , but changed opening times sells .
For that the bank will reshape the premises of those subsidiaries which are already in business zones , and they adjust to the individual customer profile of the different zones simultaneously .
So the enlargement of the opening times is joined with a new room organization of the branches which is characterized by a more current , more colorful design .
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any greater investments , but it would be accompanied by an increased personnel attitude since a branch needed now no more six , but eight or nine employees .
The subsidiaries which will be endowed even with additional premises for the KMU will not sell any financial products .
A positive experience for the group
Popular already at nine branches in Madrid tested hisdraft .
And the empirical values turned out positively , according to ÁngelRivero .
The subsidiaries of the streets bravo Murillo , O´Donell and the grain Vía were selected for that , which seems a clever decision to have been .
Popular currently guides approx . 2500 subsidiaries .
And wider 60 that operate under the name Mundocredit . These are specialized onto immigrants and point also enlarged opening times on , even on Sundays and holidays .
In these branches of PopularMax the model is not used the BBVA since most of them will offer a wide selection instead of this at non financial service services for the sale .
We would not like to represent any competition for our customers , Rivero declares .
With Telefonica they came temporarily to sell mobile telephones with the aid of external bank personnel for the agreement .

The Italian team has already five points and confirmed their participation already in the fifth round with a draw during which Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another further in Portugal in order surely that the frame check sequence Shakhtar with six points does not haul in the Befica Lissabon with four points to go .
The two games of the group D will occur a week in front of end of the sixth game round since the frame check sequence Milan at the FIFA Club world championship in Japan , which occurs at the 16ten , where he will fight for the entry at the 13ten in the semifinal for the first time into the final must line up .
So this group will be finished before all other and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion for the on all sides expected result , even if both teams will attempt to win . The Italians will not want to speculate at home indeed the Keltik Glasgow knows , that they would become in the case of a victory and would have a better starting position in this way in the dividing into eight parts final .
A defeat could suffice for the team of Gordon Strachan even with a setback of the frame check sequence Shakhtar in order to qualify . Nevertheless he should not trust all too much in such circumstances , because with nine points level stands the Ukrainians the participation ; those ones had lost last week in Glasgow indeed ( 2-1 ) , however during the second game could win ( 2-0 ) .
Accordingly the May countries will attempt therefore , the bulkheads the evening too vermiesen . The wiederrum hope for achieving the dividing into eight parts final of the reshaped Championsleague for the second time in consequence after they in the vorrangehenden game season in exactly the same round through a gate of Kaka in the consequence time ( 1-0 ) and were conquered through one zero to zero draw on the first leg .
While the frame check sequence Shakhtar is waiting to the Rossoneri for the victory , the team will have to concentrate on the own game since both the attaining of the dividing into eight parts final and his membership near the UEFA depend on his victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow .
The Benfica Lissabon could achieve the third place in spite of his lower table position and without the chance to keep on being allowed to participate in the greatest European championship through a victory and play thus near the UEFA .

Polívka came round his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the quarrel around the brand '' Kingdom of Walachei '' .
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava he used indeed when first the denomination `` Walachischer König '' , however a team had established the project in long-standing work around Tomás Harabis in cooperation with the actor .
Polívka did not participate today in the negotiations .
According to his attorney the thing in this way is probably not , however , ended and his mandator will presumably appeal .
`` The quarrel goes around Mr Harabis and his team wanting to participate in the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitically '' , attorney said after the negotiations Polívkas .
All put `` kingdom '' straight with the words `` Of Walachisches '' this actor and comedian in front of .
The same opinion also Harabis is .
`` We have an almost ten year long work behind us .
Fund-raising and drafts of the activities '' , he said .
According to it the reason is quarrel aroundmoney .
`` After years it struck them that the project is successful and that they could have also something of that .
You '' want `` to gain '' our work `` parasitically , he passed on .
Lucrative business
According to the court Polívka used the denomination `` Walachischer König '' for the first time in one of his telecasts .
In 1993 the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned it .
That was not associated , however , then with the intention to establish a fictitious kingdom .
Some years later Harabis came to the thought of distributing walachische passports .
A business and an entrepreneurial activity to which Harabis connected the foundation of the company then `` Walachisches kingdom '' formed out an originally funny action .
In 1997 Polívka agreed to the use of his name and his signature in the passports and offered their owners even reductions during the visit of his farm and his theater ideas .
Who will be on the throne ?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabis used only the bare idea which made public Polívka in the program `` circus ring '' for his entrepreneurial intentions .
`` The popularity Polívkas surely helped the project of the walachischen kingdom '' , the judge said .
She added , however , that the soul of the project Harabis that would have dedicated to it intensely and his team are .
The cooperation of the today zerstrittenen parties lasted up to the year 2000 , when Harabis organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín .
Since then , however , began themselves to accumulate the quarrels that culminated in the deduction `` König Boleslavs I. chosenly up to the Sankt Nimmerleins day '' between Polívka and Harabis .

The competition prepared by Harabis could bring clearness in the quarrel around the throne and half a princess .
A new king should follow from that .
It did not want to betray details and anappointment yet .
`` We do not want to rush anything .
It should be something like that as the royal move inWalachei .
The king should be elected for a certain time .
Also Mr Polívka can `` enroll '' himself at that quietly '' , Harabis added .

When exactly , depends on the next budget that we do not know yet .
If it should be shown that the situation is changed on the political stage , and should be ready more save , that could last up to the year 2010 .
But I do not take such a change as a basis '' , he noticed .
Debts increase

It is interesting that the growth particularly with the debentures , where the increase is 20 percent , is to be noted .
Pikora commented , `` it is bad that the debts increase , but on the other hand this already shows that one can undertake something before the pension reform comes '' , the data .
Better than expected
It follows from the financing strategy and the contact with the national debts for 2007 that the government had intended for this year to incorporate 159,2 billion crowns .
At the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan , however , thanks to the better development of the state beating hold politics on 152,8 billion crowns .
This amount stems particularly from the state budget deficit that will reach 76 billion crowns obviously this year instead of the estimated 91,3 billion .
It keeps on being a question of maximally planned means for the consolidation agency at the level of 13,3 billion crowns , a ten billion reserve for the payment of the pensions , the financing of state debentures for 43 billion and around rates for the loans near the European Investment Bank at the level of 1,8 billion .

Klaus : Debates of the ecologists are unplausible
Global climate changes damage supposedly developing countries most themost .
President Václav Klaus commented again on the problems of the global warming .
The criticism referred now to Bali onto the zu Ende gehende international conference of the UNO for the climate change .
In Vienna , where it presented his book `` one bluer , no green planet '' , he exported that the debates of the ecologists are unplausible .
According to Klaus only the structure of the conference that forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-government organizations is not inacceptable but also the basic difference between the rhetoric that she accompanies , and the reality .
`` The debate there is unstructured , it is some word fireworks that is only substitute for a real solution of current problems '' said Klaus .
The Czech president stressed during the idea of his book that his topic is very important for it , and that he commits itself to that so therefore .
He expressed also his contentment with his book being published in German translation because `` I often stumble on caricatures of my opinions . ''
Now prospective customers could gather hisattitude in a therefore undistorted way .
Klaus reminded of his not being a Klimatologe , but he has in his opinion sufficient conditions in order to write such a book .
It is finally to understand academics , capable , professional treatises and to judge , has experience with statistics and is also to nation business person .
He referred to the thesis as a main statement of the book , that the climate is changed continuously and that his changes are therefore normal , that there is not any matching opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not far too great and serious and thus did not represent any threat for the earth warming , and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate , superfluous , ineffectively and in an inacceptable way are extensive .
In addition he considers it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen , for unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on other ones , he regards that as a dangerous restriction of the freedom .
On questions of person presents he declared repeats , he is not against `` a reasonable environmental protection , however against militant eco-activists that do not take any regard onto the relation between expenditure and profit . ''
Klaus had already two months ago in the Hayek-institute talked about the same topic in Vienna .

Auchan at the most expensive , increased to Tesco around almosta fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaoerser commercial field retained also this year the average increase in prices of 16 % of the last year , with the difference that there was not any rise of the value added tax this year .
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaoerser commercial triangle the `` Napi '' increased around 16 percent the price of the usual Christmas basket also this year , however in all hypermarkets increases in prices of more than 1.000 HOOF were registered .
After the prices `` galloped off '' in the food markets in last December , the price increase did not turn out prozentuell drastically , compared with the anyhow high , former initial level .
However works determined it onto the consumers quenching , that which they had paid HUF for in the last year still far under 9.000 of this year even for 10.000 is available TO HUF .
The price of the `` Napi '' Market basket crossed the magic one 10 . 000-HOOVES-HUF Borders around at least 91 in the examined markets .
The highest price was 10.573 HOOF .
( In 6800 the price suited TO HUF at 6.800 . )
The prices for Unicum and live fish almost remained on previous year level , strong on the other hand the prices for turkey hen breast fillets , nut and poppy have climbed .
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungarians , at Auchan there was 1 kg bread loaf , however , for 139 forint .
It did not give up with the product any collapse ofprices due to competition less than 200 forint .
Also the price of one was surprising here two liters of Coca-Cola returnable bottle of less than 200 forint , thus the drink cost HUF including pledge only in 257 .
Nevertheless Auchan at the most expensive , and Cora at the most favorable cut off this year in the `` Napi '' Market basket comparison .
Our calculations made , that Cora the prices in the `` Napi '' Market basket opposite the Christmas prices in the last year at 15 , while Tesco and Auchan were increasing each about 18 percent .
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the heurigen year was 12 % , during the rise between cheapest market basket of the last year and formed most expensive the current year 's 21 % .
The average price climb was 1.480,00 HOOF .
The average increase in prices was still enclosed in the previous year 1.206,00 forint , however , the value added tax increase became noticeable with the prices of too last Christmas .
Exactly this process found the trade badly : Seemingly the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they are supposed to use with the single articles since the effects of the increase in prices on the consumer behavior were unpredictable .
( If the trader plans the rotation speed of a product badly , it can fall around essential profits in the price margin that follows the traffic intensity . )
Mehwertsteuer-relatively the price increase of the `` Napi '' Market basket turned out in the last year so radically , that the most expensive basket crossed the value of 2006 about 1720 forint , wohingegen the difference in prices at the cheapest basket only 844 forint was .
This year such extremes were not observed , there the most expensive basket about 1.630,00 forint more cost , when in the previous year , and even at the cheapest there was a price climb of 1.284,00 forint .
In the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons a catastrophic increase in prices was proved , the price of the daily consumption articles in the hypermarkets increased in little as 20 months around more than 30 percent .
( This in turn confirms not unconditional the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungarians : Near some basic foods the Statistical office found a more than 30-prozentige price increase in the period of 12 months .
So in about next to flour also near eggs . )
One flings a look , however , into the `` Napi '' Market basket , this shines at Latter almost impossible , since the price level of the product expensive already in the previous year did not go up around hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case .
Obviously there are flour suppliers in a stronger position , as the Eilieferanten - after all they could shift the drastic increase in prices to the Multis .
In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not complain ; People report constantly about good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers does not look at the prices anymore at all in the three department stores .
Great amounts are bought from everything , lasting foods go in palettes above the counters .
Wednesday morning there were in all three department stores endless snakes with the cash when suddenly the number of the customers exploded .
However , a smaller customer frequency is told by the country so that many Multis complain with the pollsters , they could not achieve even the planned turnover , and indeed not only with foods , but also near lasting consumer goods .

Yet more than one third of the pregnancies is not planned
This calculation considers the unwanted pregnancies ( 24 % ) , in the same way as the badly planned or unforeseen births .
Also today still , 40 years according to assumption of the Neuwirth-Gesetzes that allowed the contraception in France one of three pregnancies ( 36 % ) is not planned as a study of the National institute shows for demographic studies ( Ined ) .
This calculation considers the unwanted pregnancies ( 24 % ) , in the same way as the badly planned or unforeseen births .
The Ined reckons that the different methods of the contraception as the pill or the spiral still show a failure rate of 5-6 % .
Nevertheless according to the institute that states that the percentage of the pill users between 20 and 40 years that use the pill went up 60 % from 5 % in the year 1970 today the liberalization of the contraception facilitated a better control of the fertility .
Anyway eight of ten births are nowadays carefully planned .
At one of five pairs even onto the month exactly calculated , and , if possible , in the spring , the season , in which it seems most pleasant to get a child .

Allies in Afghanistan are passive , Americans say .
To few soldiers and the mangle at necessary outfit influences according to the United States the course of the mission in Afghanistan .
The NATO should project a concrete plan according to the words of defense minister Robert Gates for the next years .
The mission in Afghanistan does not proceed after their ideas , about that the representatives of the countries who stationed units in the south of the country agreed agreed to themselves in the Scotch Edinburgh .
Next to the wachsenden resistance on the part of the Taliban the eight participating states discuss also about further coordination plans among the allies .
During the United States through their Verteigungsminister Robert Gates the NATO units too more activity called , Great Britain sees the priority in the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and in the intensification of the development aid .
`` In Afghanistan a Vorwärtsentwicklung is perceptible , but military power can be only a part of the solution .
A further part consists in making to begin even a development of the economy and security for the inhabitants possible '' , the British Verteigungsminister of The Browne of the BBC says .
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached according to information of the American army the highest state since five years .
The number of power actions climbed , in the southern province Helmand , in the comparison to the previous year around 27 percent even around sixty percent .
The NATO countries stationed about 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan , of that about a quarter in the southern territory .
According to the United States the allies bumped , however , into an absolute border , which affects organization and outfit of the units .
Actually they claim further helicopters , soldiers and experts for the training of the Afghan units .
`` We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the next time and about the kind and way in which we can reach it '' , Gates said .
Similarly the secretary-general of the NATO , Jaap de Hoop , wasexpressed today .
`` I am not delighted over what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air availably .

There is also quarrel among the shared countries in the last months over whether all allies give their best in Afghanistan .
Because of passivity for example Germany wascriticized .
`` The Germans are relatively numerously represented in Afghanistan .
You are stationed in fields where there is only a minimum of power and the combat requirements are not as high for them as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country , however , '' Gates said .

Those ones are not Warhols boxes
Who combines the concepts of Swedes and Holzkiste thinks of Ikea , but not of Andy Warhol .
Or nevertheless ?
Currently dark shadows fling work list into wooden boxes produced to Swedes on Warhols .
A majority of the ninety-four there listed Brillo-boxes of the `` type Stockholm '' are forgeries .
After the Swedish newspaper stirred up Expressen some months ago doubts about the genuineness of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes of the year 1968 , internal enquiries come in the Moderna Museet into Stockholm now for a sobering result : The six `` Brillo-Boxes '' that the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet in 1995 as donation are copies - and presumably also the majority of the about a hundred more Brillo boxes of the `` Typ Stockholm '' that are on the international art market in circulation .
The case history is encapsulated , a confusing concatenation of artistic and kuratorischer productions .
In 1964 Warhol got his first `` Brillo-Boxes '' , painted wooden boxes which are based on the red-blau-weissen design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder `` Brillo '' , into New York .
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet 1968 exhibited hundreds of Brillo-boxes - with Warhols consent - of cardboard : These did not come ( from Kostengründen ) from Warhol , but they were delivered directly from the Brillo board mill .
It was a question not of works of art , but of their models , around bare exhibits .
Simultaneously Warhol gave in 1968 presumably the permission to make of a few Brillo wooden boxes which , however , were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet be produced in Sweden .
Time witnesses speak now of about fifteen boxes which then shrank as authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the denomination `` Typ Stockholm '' to right into the art and auction history .
Some of them achieved more than 100 000 dollars on auctions .
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén claimed later by mistake , it is in 1968 produced about a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden that Warhol left to him then and exhibited .
In fact Hulténs 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmoe for an exhibition in hr . Petersburg .
To this time Warhol was already three years dead .
Lars Bystroem , chief curator at the Moderna Museet , examined next to that one six museum-own Brillo-Boxes also three from Swedish private property , of which two 1968 in Stockholm were made : Your pressboard plates were primed first and ground off , after that white oil paint with a paintbrush was put on .
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 on the other hand betrays that the color with a painter role without undercoat was applied directly to the pressboard plate - in addition it is not a question around Oil- , but around acrylic color .
`` These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes by the official list '' , the director of the Moderna Museet , Lars Nittve lets announce : `` When the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication ' comes board ' in New York not to another end , the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copy/exhibition material .
Already in July certainly the Authentication Board announced to follow the `` difficult accusations '' that are raised as regards the soap powder boxes .
However , since then one wraps oneself in relentless silence there .

From Beust criticism gathers for Olympic-refusal
The moving away of the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic Summer Games bumped with politics and economy onto vehement criticism .
Many keep on wanting to fight for the games at the water .
However from Beust realism sends a reminder with|in the caseof the assessment of the chances .
The main manager of the Hamburg chamber of commerce , Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz , described on Wednesday a renunciation when `` not good for the economic location '' .
No other project developed in recent time so great motivation strengths in the city as the Olympic idea did .
`` Without this objective the sport-political swing could not be maintained in the same measure . ''
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate `` which takes a changed time ray as a basis '' not to bury the project , but to find a new long-term approach for that .
Mayor Ole of Beust stayed on Wednesday with former statements according to which at least the Olympic aspirations of Hamburg are unrealistic up to the year 2028 .
`` Not Hamburg decides about an Olympic application , but the German Olympic '' sport Federal Government '' , said from Beust WELT ONLINE .
He referred to the decision of the sport Federal Government about an application of Munich for the winter games 2018 expected for beginning of December .
`` This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic chances in the period up to now thought by us to 2028 . ''
Nevertheless the dream is not for all time dream , said from Beust .
The Hamburg sport Federal Government ( HSB ) regrettedthe statements of Beusts .
The impression that Hamburg does not want to apply in the next 25 years anymore for Olympic Games is given by that .
It is too early to obstruct a chance when one the plans buried already to this time '' , HSB president of Günter Ploss said on Wednesday .
A renunciation of the application stands furthermore contrary to the statement of the senate leader on the occasion of a reception to the plenary session of the General German College Port Association .
There from Beust the application of Hamburg for the Universiade 2015 did not describe as substitute '' for Olympic Games in Hamburg .
The college port association had nominated as an applicant city only in the last week Hamburg .
The SPD citizens faction reproached the senate not to have used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg .
`` The Development of the Small Grasbrooks was delayed by the senate for years because he put Olympia on the card and `` ignored '' the house building '' , the SPD-representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast said .
While the SPD was always demanding an integrated planning for the Kleinen Grasbrook for Olympia and a later living-use , the CDU put on one side on the `` event-factor '' .
The Application for the Olympic Summer Games 2012 had activated a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at that time .
Leipzig had defeated , however , Hamburg .

As the gazette of Venezuela informed , the clocks are set according to a new law for the world time minus four and a half hours .

`` I can that already only because of my dignity not '' , Chávez that drives forward a constitution reform which the citizens of the oil country must vote on on Sunday in a referendum said .
With the reform he would build up his power clearly inthe country .
Trigger of the quarrel was the decision Uribes to extract the mandate from Chávez for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia in the case of which it was a question of the release from hostages .
Uribe spat Venezuela with his decision into the face , Chávez had criticized on Sunday .
Also in Spain Munde is Chávez in all of it .

Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As environmental minister Gábor Fodor announced , the expert meetings end on Tuesday , and the debate about the international climate-regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening .
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss about the timetable of Bali , in which the emission-reducing measures for the time after 2012 , therefore after the Kyoto protocols , defined are .
Currently a vehement debate is in progress between industry and development countries .
The USA signaled already that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers , however , they would be ready to reduce the hothouse gas emissions around 25-40 percent to 2020 in comparison with 1990 .
The other great question of the conference is whether the industrial countries are ready next to the reduction of the emissions the developing countries both financial , than to support also technologically .
Also an agreement about the support was achieved by developing countries .
The one subordinated to the Kyoto protocols adaptation fund is supposed to be administered by a 16-headed council , probable at the Globalen Umweltfazilität ( GEF ) of the UNO , as in the `` Piac és profit '' is to be looked up .

The attempt of the EU to retain their role of the pioneer with global climate protection measures , and to achieve a new international agreement to 2009 supports environmental minister Gábor Fodor on behalf of Hungary .
The minister that becomes EU until in 2020 the hothouse gas emissions reduce around 20 % ( measured by the values by 1990 ) declared independently of that whether the `` Getting off after 2012 '' is achieved successfully , or not . The union would be even ready to support a 30-prozentige reduction soferne other great industrial countries of the world , and/or developing countries also ready are , their obligations according to strengths and to come later responsibly .
Gábor Fodor stressed that the aim of the states that had joined the Kyoto protocols in 1997 was a reduction only of 5,2 percent wohingegen the EU with theirs then 15 member states already for a minus of 8 % had obliged .
The handicap for Hungarians says reduction of the hothouse gas emissions around 6 % in comparison with the years 1985-87 - a handicap that will absolutely fill the country as in the press release of the environmental ministry is to be looked up .
The use is high on Bali - after all the long-term international climate-political agreement must be within two years ready , otherwise it would come into force with security first after 2012 . In This Case no renewed , international emission reduction system would follow the reduction projects defined in the Kyoto protocols , whose importance also the IPCC has emphasized , the scientific climate change committee of the UNO in his recent report international , honored with the Nobel peace prize .
Through that the emission reduction would be delayed , and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more that would result extremely fatal and irreparable consequences in the consequence according to Wissenschaftern than 2°C would be unavoidable .

It all rakes want to do - or as one becomes uninteresting forother
Stop and go-Verkehr , the car right in the allmorgendlichenjam .
From the radio a strange melody rings out : The sound of a violin , paired with electronic effects .
I turn the volume more highly .
The speed changes , the bass comes to the previous sounds , and as a real sound jewel a feminine choir .
It is the song `` Wings of Love '' of Zagar which rings out onmr2 .
The domestic music scene did just not spoil us long time with qualitative Electropop .
However , now one sees even the jam different if one hears the new album of Zagar in this case .
The appearance of Yonderboi , so manch new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene contribute slowly to a change of the overall picture , and self when the garage skirt with his Gitarrengequitsche is again `` in '' the domestic Electropop proves : There is new one under the sun .
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs , played music even in the band Yonderboi , before it - maybe , because an inn takes none two piper - his own way to walk along began .
It created the breakthrough with his project ( Zagar ) and his music that melts elements together from jazz , Electronic , and pop , however , first than one with the request , to compose the soundtrack for a film , onto it had confronted ( e.g..
`` Szezon '' of Ferenc Töroek ) .
The formation that at the beginning had performed in smaller clubs became known to the wider public first , as the magazine `` wan2 '' their first album from the year 2002 under the top 50 domestic nightmares followed and Zagar , together with Yonderboi , to the almost only one chose , also in the west marketable trendsetter .
Without a doubt Zagar and his band were `` trendy '' , it did not interest , however , any whether they bear this brand also with pleasure .
The band reacted , as it should : With a new , even better album .
The now appeared new album with the title `` Can not Walk Fly Instead '' could reveal them new ways , however , already the title expresses the wish with the Pécser years according to continuity .
The expression originates indeed from the time , when Balázs Zságer was still on the way with another band .
The airy , flying allusion would be also in order , to fall , however , next to the ethereal character of the music the - corresponding to the spirit of the time and the trends - louder guitar , the influences of the rock'n'roll on .
With these songs the singer Gyoergy Ligeti living in England and working with the band `` The Puzzle '' introduced himself during the premiere in the Millenáris .
A song of the album created it even for the radio hit - that as of quite recently of early set to mr2 Petfi sending pop music late to the listeners with the number `` Wings of Love '' that was recorded by six domestic singers ( `` Underground Divas '' ) under collaboration successively the earwig .
Everything all right therefore ( ? ) .
The hvg.hu asked with Balázs Zságer .
hvg.hu : This new hit raises the question : To what extent does your music of a certain shift keep on being reserved ?
Balázs Zságer : The concept `` shift music '' doesnot intimate just much to me .
In my opinion there are two castes in the pop music , and indeed not main stream and underground , or Alternativ and pop , but Kommerziell and honest .
Even the so-called alternative or underground-music can be shallow and meaningless , just the same they can also be produced , however , only for the sale which turns it into commercial music .
Also a good pop-number can arise from an honest motive .
The acceptance of the listener functions also according to this principle , independently of languages and borders .
hvg.hu : Do you see a difference in the frankness of the Hungarian one and the foreign public opposite your music ?
B . Zs . : Abroad , in particular west of us the pop music has a greater tradition .
There not only teenagers or Twens onto concerts , but also the older public go .
You pursue the trends in the pop music that pass around them around , much more attentive , because they hold it also for a part of the contemporary culture .
hvg.hu : Which role is attributed to the public during yourwork ?
It is important , who , where , how many hear your music ?
B . Zs . : A good feeling to see is natural it that to come to our concerts more and more .
We have never composed , however , for the market .
With us the music does not arise in order to be used for a purpose but for a certain reason .
The role of the public is perceptible mostly at the concerts , where there is already a mutual interaction , but there is that one in turn only in the unreachable changes of the moment .
Nevertheless one struck me : You want to make it all right , you are not more interesting .
hvg.hu : How far would you like to follow the example fromYonderboi ?
It is as a soloist on the way and ratherestablished his career in the west .
B . Zs . : We do not go in fact his way , once from that very foreseen that one attempts again and again to interpret this in into our music .
We rather see ourselves than Teamplayer who trust in the musical presence of the other one and they make themselves unfold .
At the beginning comparisons of our work with that one were of course inevitable from Yonderboi since several of us come from his band and took another way .
hvg.hu : In the charts of mr2 Petfi `` Wings of Love '' stands at first place .
Many heard the name Zagar first in connection with thisnumber .
Was the opening with an a little more popular style in the direction consciously of a wider public produced ?
B . Zs . : We did not have any plans to write a hit which then is supposed to serve as a train horse for the album .
In this song it is a question of more .
It was considered as a final of the album with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult topics .
hvg.hu : How did you select the six singers ?
Why just they , what the leading-principle was ?
B . Zs . : The basic idea was to do a gospel-like choir .
Then the idea to put together the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene came .
So the six-headed choir arose - therefore Sena , Edina Kutzora , Judie Jay , Bori Péterfy , Enik Hodosi [ Neo ] , Juci Németh - , that we christened to apäter `` Underground Divas '' then .
hvg.hu : You wanted to have the song just the same , or did the girls co-design it ?
B . Zs . : There was the number already longer in the instrumental version , but when the material was ready for the album , we thought that this number still needs something .
The piecework sequence demanded ceremonially according to asong voice .
I sang the melody still in the same night , later the girls learned it .
It everything came virtually immediately and frightening spontaneous .
I can remember , I was then quite electrified , but one already needed also the `` divas '' .
With my voice alone the song would never have become sostrong .
hvg.hu : Both on the plate , when also during the concert one had , however , the impression the girls would be in the background .
There is not any solo part ( foreseen from the short solo from Judy Jay ) , they do not have any own role , they completely sing together and they are not louder , as the music , therefore their song is not only accompanied from the music .
Also on the stage they stood behind .
Is it intention ?
B.Zs . : That they stood behind was like this because ofproblems technical in that .
However we wanted to them consciously not to made any soloroles be attributed .
In the number it is a question also of one being supposed to forget his ego a little bit , forgotten , who from where come and where it is on the way , we let in simply too , that us lift these certain wings , the wings of the love .
I would have with pleasure , that also other sense this euphoric state that we sensed than the song arose .
hvg.hu : Which one was the most extensive song ?
B . Zs . : During the musical work work of no actually at all , there were rather while mixing more difficult tasks .
For example with `` Dorian Gray 's Dilemma '' , in which I play on a concert piano , or with `` rock'n'roll Goes To The Girls '' , where the Groove did not want to function longer , nevertheless little by little everything turned out , as with a puzzle .
hvg.hu : Which one is your darling number of the new album ?
B . Zs . : That changes with the concerts constantly and also now , where I have the album `` losgelasssen '' .
Currently it is `` Prophet Is A Fool '' , `` Escape From The Earth '' and the number `` Never The Same '' .

Everything still open
Mitt Romey said , he does not consider worthily of a premiership candidate to be consulted from a snowman .
In spite of that the republican candidate for the premiership declared himself ultimately readily to be confronted with a debate on YouTube in which normal voters video questions and submit questions in order to send it to the candidate .
None of the questions that were raised at the Wednesday evening , the 28th November , were as ridiculous as the snowman was , the democrats ' about the global warming in the YouTube Debatte of the other party questioned .
But the questions , and the answers , reflected this time the state of the republican party which opens into the choices in the next year exactly .
It is not known , exactly as the producers of CNN , which supported the debate that clips selected the prospective candidate to YouTube to be shown .
Yet in the first half hour of the debate , the longest the a single topic was dedicated , immigration stood in the center .
The topic is one of the strongest topics for republicans .
The CNN asked a group to operate a dial from undecided voters if they heard things that they liked : The TV organization noticed tops of the approval than the candidates talked about the borders severely .
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani , the national forerunner , and Romney which shifted itself forward in the decisive inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire .
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call , it was soft with regard to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York .
He attacked Romney in that it the former governor immigrants accused by Massachusetts , illegal for work at his house have prepared .
The two stopped especially hard than interrogators asked whether an `` amnesty '' ( that would give illegal a regular status and the possibility onto the citizenship ) would support to one of the candidates .
More insignificant candidates as Duncan Hunter , a Californian congress representative , and Tom Tancredo , a congress representative from Colorado , it succeeded with this topic nachzuhaken .
No one of the two men has serious chances during the nomination , but both stay in the running , maybe because they formerly and in a harder way beat onto the immigration bass drum as other .
To divide into the field of the immigration at least the candidates on the whole the same opinions : sharper borders , intolerance opposite illegal migrants .
This topic , together with fears about poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world , the differences help the republicans with forgetting or minimizing between liberals and Christian conservatives .
But the debate brought unequivocally problematic as other topics for the language .
Mr Giuliani was asked to , for which it supported arm restrictions in the past .
John McCain and Romney discussed about whether simulated drowning should be considered as torture .
One of the interrogators asked whether the candidatesbelieve every word of the Bible .
This resulted in Giuliani representing the point of view that although the Bible is his preferred book , it the history of Jonah and the whale maybe not literal believes .
A further interrogator asked whether Jesus would support the deathpenalty|capital punishment .
Mike Huckabee - now towards all expectations on the first place in an inquiry recently carried out in Iowa thanks to his Christian Konservativismus existing for a long time - it said that the death penalty is painful , but necessary .
When he was pushed on whether Jesus would approve it , he laughed at that and said Jesus was too intelligent in order to apply for a political office .
The race remains unusually far open .
Huckabees rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls recent donation successes and his storms of applause in the debate of Wednesday .
These two shot up from the nothingness , because the two wings of the party up to now not yet onto one of the better known and more traditional candidates of some could .
Per year in 1980 and 2000 a candidate united the party with a victorious message about the size of Americas and a winking to both wing of the party from the beginning and convincingly .
This time the party is fissured and the result is not clear by far .

Fraudulent broker risked because of inferiority feelings billions
Bottomless swindler
So the French bank giant Société Générale , owner of the local Komerní banka , describes his former Done Jerome Kerviel .
She lost indeed almost five billion euros because of it .
It does not seem , however , rather so that Kerviel was only a tall player that wanted to do it like his colleagues in addition surely incapable was .
For the difference to all big bank houses he recognized the crisis in time at the amerikanischenn mortgage market .
`` It is psychologically rather weak '' , was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors that announced it near the police .
It a human being who had achieved profits at the end of last year with his businesses at the level of 1,6 billion euros was how , however , Kerviels which the French media , for example the daily paper Le Monde , published follows from the statements .
Crisis not only in America
`` All which I wanted money was to be earned for my bank '' , he says in his statement .
In the summer he had succeeded in earning half a billion of euros just from the American crisis .
He had already indeed at the year beginning spotted the occasion forthis purpose .
In February there was already first news about so-called sub-prime-mortgages as they are given to income-weak customers or such which already formerly had installment problems turning out in trouble .
This crisis should not have influence on the whole economy , however .
Kerviel did not believe that and was right .
At the end of the year it had screwed his profit highlyup to 1,6 billion euros .
`` Already than I the first half billion had earned , I did not know , as I that should not declare '' , Kerviel adds and passes on that it did not keep anything definitively for itself .
During the whole interrogation he admits that he forged documents so that one would not come him to the pulps .
He succeeded even in leading his heads behind the light even if the Eurex stock exchange was interested in his businesses by degrees .
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up ?
Presumably hardly .
`` I thought , that they the simple fact , that I have earned for the bank 1,6 billion , satisfies . ''
From where did he take the courage to risk so much ?
He had to acquire his position in a step by step way .
It came into the Société Générale in the year 2000 , immediately after it had ended his study at the Lyons university , one .
His annual salary was about 51000 dollars .
After two years he was already assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 he became selfcontinuous broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars .
Nevertheless he knew that he will never earn as much as other ones .
`` Already at my first conversation in the year 2005 I knew that one observed me .
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development '' , Kerviel declared the investigator .
But already soon to his entry the first great success came .
With the stocks of the alliance he earned a lot in his putting half a billion of euros on course losses of this title with the London bomb attacks .
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more .
Solang du Gewinn make , we let to you
`` That is as a snowball '' , he said to the policemen .
But the heads supposedly out of everything knew , and/or foresaw it .
`` As long as I earned money , one closed the eyes . ''
However , then the great stroke came at the beginning this year .
On a single day he lost a billion euros .
At a weekend in the middle of January wanted to balance it that .
When he came to the work on Monday , he was already not anymoreemployees ' of the bank .
And a few days later the bank announced that she lost five billion euros because of it .
And as came they it onto the pulps ?
It looked suspicious through a vacation .
`` I took only four days of the previous year .
A broker who does not take any vacation is one who does not want one to look to him into the cards '' , Kerviel said definitively .

Parallel to the parliamentary preparation , that today with the congress decision in the senate on the ones , the project corresponding , addition-/ amendments their meeting ended , the government published the regulations that follow from the new law with the intention , the coming into effect of both regulations to at the end of the year facilitate .

Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi : Voruteile fade away
To say around the truth I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206 .
His going-properties were not a lot worth , one could refer to the quality of the gear-change , the guidance and also the processing as rather lower-average .
However , now his successor , the Peugeot 207 , is on the market , and that one is better around many things .
The station wagon with the SW denomination is another piece wider , and revising my opinion only remains to me .
When I of the classical Hatchback of the 207 had tested , I had to complain for example about the too small head freedom on the rear seats .
There are not these complaints now anymore , because the bodywork of the station wagon is so formed that not even two meter men will suffer .
Quickly wider
I go through the interior trim only shortly in order not to repeat myself too very much .
It is a question of a quite succeeded design , where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel 's objections .
There I would welcome a little more designerische organization , where otherwise the car does a so elegant impression .
The seats are comfortable , and past the times are where we complained about too short seats or headrests possibly .
Also the side hold improved to that considerably oppositeitself in 206 .
What affects the room offer , one can sense also here the increased measurements of the bodywork .
In the station wagon also the already mentioned lack of head freedom isremoved .
Suitcase into the trunk
The main thing at this car is , however , the loadingspace|hold|payload bay .
I must designate that one ( also because of the drop-down moving-window ) as very well beladbar and space-saving .
The cavities are equipped with safety belts which represent an ideal compromise .
You do not disturb , make yourself be separated and hold also more difficult objects .
But let 's talk about the case volume .
It is according to table in the basic version 428 liters , which is a rather average value in the comparison for the competition .
However not in the comparison to the vehicle of this class , the Škoda Fabia Combi , meistverkauften in Tschechien .
If we compare to the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav , we find , that the Peugeot remains around clearly perceptible 52 liters .
For a foreign vacation or while inviting a pram this value is already critical .
But in order to emphasize the Positiva , I must mention still the loading space very flat after the turnover of the back seats or also the very low sill .
120 hp in four row
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with stroke volume 1,6 liters and an achievement of 88 kilowatts .
And a 1600-cube-engine which stimulates a Familien-Hatchback should look honestly said , so .
It is quiet , has a small consumption and migrateswell .
If I compare it with his counterpart at Škoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust with a cloth would have been blocked , I can be then only inspired by him .
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is just not popular .
We must remember , however , our having tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine .
The basic price of the car with the 1400th gasoline engine at the level of 329900 crowns still starts .
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns what already quite a lot is .
The equipment Premium of the test car is noticeable once again with 80000 crowns besides .
We had , however , head air bags , automatic air-conditioning , automatic windshield wiper triggering , electrical window lifters behind and and ...
So the car costs in total 531900 crowns settles .
That is an amount , however you add up the options of a Fabia once and you will arrive with a very similar sum .
Therefore only still the decision which brand one wantsto choose remains .

Buses return fugitives to the work - and in order to fightAl-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi fugitives from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday , with a stream of marketed ones whose resources or Visas ran out , and other ones who hoped for the city to normality returning .
Some had even come back around the rebels combat , that had marketed it from their houses .
At the bus station Mansour , still before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen of penalties , that one was active to Terminal with fugitives from Syria and Jordan that had returned in private transportation .
`` I decided on going to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad '' , Sabah Al-Qubaisi , a sunnitischer doctor , said .
`` I came today back , because of what I saw on televison and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and as it would be now secure . ''
You say that the Mahdi-army stopped killing people '' , he said , with respect to the Schiitenmilizen of the militant clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr who ordered to put his strengths to the present time back .
Qassim al Atwani , a 38-year old schiitischer teacher from the predominant one sunnitische part of Amariyah , with his two children turned , because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqi to work .
His schiitischen neighbors in Amariyah appealed to him in order to say to him that a militia local , supported by the USA helped to drive out Al-Qaida of their bastion in the west of the capital , and insisted it for the return .
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a sunnitischen and schiitischen tribe who had been driven out of his house by an attack with grenades in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad after who having been called his fellow citizens for the abatement Al-Qaidas .
He was to come back in order to fight .
`` Two days ago some of my friends called me and said to me , that they began one the Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys .
That is why I returned today '' , Sabaah Alu Obeidi , 62 , said .
Many told , that they had been attracted through the increasing rest in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local `` groups affected citizen '' , which one arms and defend their quarters in collaboration with the American military .
However more spoke of that , to have been forced home through visa problems and versiegender resources in Damascus , where more than 1,3 million Iraqis had fled in the last years .
Salaam al-Samarrai , a 51-year old three times father , expressed to force the general suspicion among the Exilanten that Nouri al-Maliki , the schiitische Prime Minister , had requested of the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions for the fugitives , around people for the return .
More than two and a half millions of people fled presumably from the sectarian death squadrons in the country .
`` We were fine until al-Maliki Syria visited and '' it said `` the government was urgent not to give the Iraqis any visas more in order to force her for the return into Iraq '' the sunnitischen pensioners ' .
`` I can not trust a government that supports the criminals , that my house burned down , after I went away . ''
A part of the reason for the drop of the power is that Sunniten were driven out of schiitischen residential areas , where tensions decreased , and vice versa , which led to the creation of many places .

Which insurance is suitable for me best ?
The KFZ insurance that covers a possible damage case caused by the driver contains a high cost whose height wiederrum depends on different factors , and other from age , sex , time of the creation of the driver 's license , marital status , kind of the car to be insured and his use , and so forth .
To own a car is only the beginning .
Because the suitable KFZ insurance is to be found in an even more difficult way than the correct vehicle model is .
At first once it must be clear to one with what we have to do it here .
An selfinsurance is an agreement between an assurance company and an insured .
This agreement to present the corresponding indemnity in a damage case is held in writing by means of a contract of insurance which determines that the society receives the arranged insurance premium and is engaged in the corresponding train .
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists through several factors , and other age , sex , time of the creation of the driver 's license , marital status , kind of the vehicle to be insured or that use .
The insurance enterprises set their prices according to the statistics so that with a higher danger of accident also higher contribution payments become due .
For this reason must both more than 25-year than also women of few contribution payments achieve , because statistics prove that these groups show a smaller accident rate thanks to their caution .
The same one is valid also for married persons , there this according to statement of the statistical values and accordingly also according to conviction of the enterprises , to less accidents tend as singles .
The benefit that is attributed to the vehicle influences the frequency of the driving and in this way also the probability of an accident .
The more frequent the use , the more probably the damage .
The insurances must consider a whole series of points at the installation of the premium .
For this reason also the driver must study the situation thoroughly in order to select the selfinsurance which complies with his personal needs at the ehesten exactly .
We list at this place the most important points that one should take into account during the selection of an insurance now around not only one power- , but to be able to find also a price-oriented choice .
The less than 25-year long ones encounter numerous obstacles , as e.g . the small going-practice and the young driver 's license , during the choice of an economical insurance .
Nevertheless , even if it was for an ideal insurance cover best to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance , there are more economical alternatives .
The cautious drivers can select one Vollkasko with deduction so that indeed the services of a full fully comprehensive insurance are covered , but they are offered for a low price .
This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount itself arisen from the damage .
The amount is defined before end of the contract and by means of the height of the insurance premium . This is more highly ever smaller the sum to be paid , Luis Nogüra , main representative of Spain , declares near ridge Europe , a mediation enterprise for online insurances .
Another option is not the enlarged insurance that insures the customer against external accident damages , however , against the harm arisen at the own car .
In addition this kind of the insurance would cover theft , fire and vehicle loss .
Here a council .
If you are less than 25 years old , it suits in your hand to lower the insurance costs ; so your credit increases itself when you attempt to go cautiously and to avoid accidents .
A credit is a lowering of the base rate near the corresponding assurance company .
In the opposite for this purpose a punishment paymentcontains an increase of said rate .
The height of credits and punishment payments depend from the society and those one profits .
If the enterprise has a profit-rich year behind itself , can be taken the liberty to increase the bonus-payments , Nogüra explains .
As soon as the 25-year brand is crossed , it is simpler for the drivers to sign a contract . Reason for that is the fact that with increasing going-practice the accident rate sinks .
Thus it is most reasonable to decide for a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction .
Usually the young people can not profit from their previous experience no , both in the case of an accident and at the moment of the driving not , explains that one Spanish chief of the European enterprise , and adds , that the majority of the accidents to happen in the second practice year after the fear of the beginner was put aside .
Nevertheless it is with a married customer who does not have any children more advisable to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance ; natural only then , if it also approves the financial situation of the corresponding person .
On the part of the insurers married couples with children are regarded as the customers with the least accident rate , and correspondingly low also their contribution payments turn out .
In This Case a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction would be ( with an amount around the 300 euros ) the best option . In the case that one received a high credit , an enlarged insurance that starts first to the third vehicle year is recommended .
You go more loosely in total and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to apply a higher contribution payment Luis Nogüra states .
For pensioners it is good to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction ( with an amount around the 150 euros ) , or an enlarged insurance which does not start before with a sufficiently high credit .
Finally one must observe that the selfinsurance is something very important not only , because it protects the driver against possible accident damages , but also , because it contains high costs that require it , that a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation is found .

Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
The Venus is more similarly than up to now thought in spite of their life-hostile atmosphere of the earth : The European space probe `` Venus Express '' has flashes in the atmosphere and wind whirl at the poles discovers how they occur in the winter also on the earth .
Since almost three decades scientists presume that it flashes on the Venus .
Now the European probe `` Venus Express '' produced the proof - she traced electro-magnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere : The flashes on the Venus fire in a height from cloud to cloud of about 56 kilometers , Christopher Russel of the University of California tells in Los Angeles in the science magazine `` Nature '' .
According to the famous `` Ursuppen-Theorie '' flashes made the life arise on the earth : Thunderstorms are supposed to have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the education from amino acids the elements of the life .
Not so on the Venus : `` If there were ever lives over there , it must have been in the very early history '' , Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution declares in Washington .
Today there might hardly be on the surface of the Venus something live : The atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on the earth , there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees .
`` The Venus is maybe the devil twin of the earth , but she is a twin '' , Russel said .
Why the Venus is , the the earth in mass and size so similar , a so entirely different development has struck , the Esa-Mission is the basic question .
The start of `` Venus Express '' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus-research since since beginning of the nineties no probe anymore was especially on the way for the exploration of this planet .
The newest research results , that `` are imagined '' now in several `` Nature '' -Artikeln , do not underline in the view of the researchers only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system .
`` You also show that the common characteristics of our neighbor planet with the earth are greater than first of all accepted '' the Esa informs .
The researchers found like this also a cloud whirlpool next to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole at the South Pole which turns still considerably more quickly .
The phenomenon reminds of airflows on the earthly winter hemisphere , a team of researchers writes around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica .
The second-innermost planet of the solar system has the almost same mass as the earth does and is almost just as big with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers .
The planet referred to also as a morning or evening star circles in just 225 days around the sun .
He turns itself much more slowly , however , around themselves : A Venus day lasts 243 earth days .
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees of centigrades and a pressure of 92 cash hardly reminds of the earth , scientists assume that both planets had arisen under very similar conditions .
On both water that remained on the earth on which Venus , however , got lost into the space in oceans was collected .
And while carbon dioxide is being fixed on the earth in carbonate rocks , it defines the majority of the atmosphere on the Venus .

The reunion and the world tour overlap with the publication of a new album which contains their greatest hits and two more new songs , Headlines and voodoo , and that in Spain under the label of EMI appears .

For that , that they has given a teddy bear a name , it was demonstrated today to a court in Khartum .
According to specification of their attorney the British teacher that had been accused of insult of the Islam in Sudan on Thursday evening was condemned to 15 days of custody and subsequent expulsion by a court in Khartum .
The Briton was accused , allowed to pupils six to seven year old to have , a teddy bear to give the name Mahomet although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden .
She would have deserved to be whipped .
After parents of pupils had complained repeatedly near the Sudanese Ministry of Education , the 54-year old elementary-school teacher who was active at the Unity High School of Khartum was picked up on Sunday with themselves at home and accused to article 125 of the Sudanese penal code of the insult of the Islam .
In fact this matter takes their beginning in September when the teacher asks their pupils six to seven year old to select a name for the class teddy .
The children suggest eight names , told to Hassan , Abdullah and Mohammed , under that headmaster Robert Boules .
Finally when the class votes 20 of 23 children of Mohammed choose as a dearest first name .
Certainly , Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet , however particularly also a first name very frequent in Sudan .
Then the children constructed a book for the class , with which photo of the bear on that and the caption is My Name Mohammed .
The bear itself did not bear any label with this name , but the problem that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as an insult of the Islam is very simple .
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian gibbon 's that teaches Sudan at the same school , declared , he knows it well , and she would never have something would have done , with which it could kick a religious belief too near , I only regret that them the children asked for voting for a name his opinion 's acts it at that only around an innocent error .
An opinion that numerous pupils of the teacher divide that these as very attentive opposite their pupils and as a person , who never talks about religion in the class describe .
One considers , that the first name of Mohammed is simultaneously also the one in Great Britain at the second most frequent given second name , for which in the English 14 different spelling exists .
This first name often selected by Moslem families is regarded as a kind of respect at the prophets ( it is given frequently to the first-born of a family ) .
But how loud the rules in the reference to the use of this first name ?
One may give it for example a toy ?
This is as a matter of course a question of the interpretation .

NHS must control foreign employees
The Scotch State National Health Service must improve the controls of the prior conviction registers for employees of outside of Europe , a member of the control organ said . outside
The recommendation of the main finance controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought by Glasgow in Scotland in Zusammmenhang with the assault on the airport in June .
Black expressed also about that objections that the Scotch state National Health Service does not have any precise ideas with regard to the number of his ausländischischen employees .
But his report referred to other important controls being carried out by five health authorities at a random sample correctly .
The main finance controller examined personnel which was recruited outside of the countries of the European market in consequence of the assault for the airport of Glasgow .
Bilal Abdullah , 28 , an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Krankenhaus in Paisley , was arrested at the airport after a ground car was driven by the doors of the main airport terminal .
He was one of three doctors who appeared in October in a video signal transmission in the Old Bailey , and was burdened in connection with the probable self bomb attack in Great Britain .
It is expected that the State National Health Service previously of the employment of foreign employees carries out controls in order to guarantee that these have the necessary qualifications , experiences and authorizations in order to work in the United Kingdom .
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland for the inspection of prior conviction registers , the agency does not decree about the responsibility to obtain these information outside of Great Britain .
The report of the main tester says now , next to other recommendations , that the executive board is supposed to pick up guidelines of the police records departure that helps employers with controls in different countries .
`` Although we found references to these controls in some personnel documents , these were not carried out routinely . '' the report found .
Black said the Scotch health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines before the employment with high measure , however , added : `` Our report shows fields in which the system can be improved in order to guarantee that precise information about the number of the foreign National Health Service employees are available . ''
BMA Scotland chairperson Dr. Peter Terry said it is `` extremely improbable '' , that investigations previously of the employment of potential NHS employees would identify people that could inspect future terrorist assaults .
`` In the report it is called , that current Voranstellungstests of the NHS Scotland function well and it is not clear which added value the recommendations will supply '' , he said .
The Scotch health authorities say that they currently have 1.161 foreign employees the predominant majority of that doctors and nurses .
However , the finance controller warned against the number being probably higher also therefore because the executive boards would have problems to identify those employees that are on leave onto indefinite time .
The investigation kept on finding , that established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire , Arran , Grampian , Greater Glasgow and Clyde , Lanarkshire , to have been stopped and Lothian mainly .
Passport , work permit , and qualification controls appertain tothat .
the Scotch government checks currently their politics and guidelines for controls before employment beginning for foreign personnel in the NHS .
The secretary for health Nicola Sturgeon said : It was to me to carry out a request onto the Glasgow airport this work faced with the terrorist attack . ''
It added that the recommendations of the report consider the Scotch government , in connection with the health authorities , and would guarantee that the best practices reflected in updated guidelines concerning the control investigations previously of the employment of all employees again - under that also that one from the exterior - that publication is planned next month .

In the empire of Angela Wolke
The unrealistic appearance of the chancellor documents that the coalition is at the end with regard to the contents - and that nothing anymore is to be expected by her itself .
In which country does this Federal Chancellor live actually ?
After their hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag that was wurschtig and contents-poor one must say : not here - not in the country that would have to be ruled over by it at last .
Angela Merkel with a badly arrogant sentence rejected the reproach that she concentrates on the foreign policy too very much .
That is provincial , she said and it showed in this way first what it is a question of for the critics that she does not want to understand .
In the Bundestag she documented for all in recognizable form , as very much their reproach applies .
There neither concrete interest nor a feeling at all was to be sensed for the problems in the country .
Instead of this Angela Wolke presented himself : a removed politician who flees into the foreign policy and stays even there in the rough one .
Example climate protection : There she praises itself unbrakedly for the decisions of saint dam , it does not say , however , how the climate objectives are supposed to be reached in these parts .
Anyway , the self praise - the CDU leader would have refrained from so much presumptuousness still two years ago .
Now she clings to the empty phrase , that the upswing arrives at the people .
In this way it damages their image as a Pragmatikerin who solves problems instead of talking the world beautifully .
But in the empire of Angela Wolke inside-political problems are an edge appearance .
Child poverty and the worries of the low earners ?
She has a few subordinate clauses for thatremaining .
It is characteristic in this case how she is often mistaken when it is a question of the children 's allowance .
Merkel needs three runs there in order to bring out a to someextent straight sentence .
She stumbles as on foreign terrain if it becomesconcrete .

Not very below in Moscow
The price of an airplane of the brand Gulfstream G550 , endowed with a Rolls-Royce-engine and range enough in order to fly from Moscow non-stop to Los Angeles is near at least 54 million dollars .
But that is small change for some of the rich Russians .
`` It offers place for up to 18 passengers '' , Dan Firer , a Gulfstream-representative , said .
`` But no one of you asks for as many seats because it is for a private family or an enterprise president . ''
Firer was at the Gulfstreamstand on the last Friday during the millionaire exhibition , one four day 's orgy of consumption set for the show that was organized in an encapsulated exhibition center at the outskirts of a town of the capital .
In addition to Gulfstream more than 200 other luxury providers had built up booths , on that hoping , to interest again to money come Russians at everything , of mahogany-paneled yachts up to diamond-excessive selfcrickets that would be appropriate for 50 cents .
Firer took cautiously a shining orangenen Porsche into the visor at the next booth .
`` That is a beautiful car , but it is small change in comparison with us '' , he said .
`` To the United States Russia is the second-largest market for private airplanes . ''
The Russian capital seems heated from an oil boom as floodedly with money as Dallas to his heydays does .
`` We went through the same phase into the 1890ern , as if Amerikaner unites too gigantic fortune came and into crowds to Europe would go where they were regarded as materialistic '' Mars resonance Goldman , a scientist , would say at the Davis center for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Harvard university .
As the Saudi-Arabian Überflieger of the 1970th and the Japanese in the 1990ern , the Russians protrude as the free money output units most visible in the world .
The most excluding luxury brands search theirpart at the gold drunkenness .
Elsewhere in Moscow in this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault , the chairperson of LVMH , put on in order ideas over how one can sell hochpreisige goods on markets as Russia to be exchanged .
( The conference is organized by The International Herald tribunes that the New York Times Company belongs . )
Russia has 53 billionaires who have in total 282 billion dollars , according to the Forbes list of the richest people .
In addition 103.000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class that a total of 670 billion dollars are worth according to a study about the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union , that of economic experts of the center for economic and finance research , an expert committee here , was written .
( The World Bank says that per year in 2005 15,8 percent of the Russians lived under the bare subsistence level . )
`` There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - therefore we all are here , Nicole Marais , a sale and marketing representative of David Morris , told to a London jeweler '' .
She had gone to the fair for the first time together with the Russian trader of the brand , the Soho Jewelry Group .
`` The women are all exemplarily well-kept and the men are all property worth . ''
While they are pulling Sunday night into evening dress through the halls , two immovable brokers , Evgenia Yumatova , 21 , and Svetlana Turovtsova , call 26 , themselves and their clients millionaires .
`` I looked after the cars and I attempt to decide between the Infiniti , the Mercedes and Porsche '' , Ms Yumatova who delivered the designer clothing which supported it , as a Roter-Teppich-Veteran with Joan Rivers , said .
It seemed the fair in the first place to aim at the new-rich ones to stand the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers that would be ready several hours in the jam in order to go to a drafty warehouse that geschmachloserweise Cadillac of Escalades , jackknives of platinum , Mövenpick Eiskrem , tailor-made Billiardtische , flatlets in Dubai and Gund teddy bear next to each other set .
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ( 44.57 dollar ) .
`` The Russians are interested to learn at that which brand the most expensive and best is '' said Mr Gijrath that at a booth of the Dutch Porcelain Manufacturer Royal Delft fit patriotically before a wall-large Imitat of a Rembrandt picture from hand-painted , blue tesseras .
`` Russians are natural more at Klimper-Klimperinterests . ''
In Fact the traders say here , that the Russians with old money ( 10 to 15 years is according to Russian standards old ) already of pretentious logos for the kind of sober brands with restricted numbers of items have moved , that would not commercialize themselves with a commercial show .
In spite of that several thousands of people pushed , whether millionaires , envoys of millionaires or simply tourists every day through the halls .
And some of them bought .
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday Roman Ershov said , the general manager of King Koil beds here , he would sell two 70.000 dollar mattress sets , produced from silk , Kaschmir and cotton , with gold threads sewn in .
Also in the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov , a sale manager for A1 Moto , of a company said the High-End-Autos with High-End-Alarmsystemen equips , that his company sold the garish orangenen Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170.000 dollars .
Up to the Sunday afternoon Andrei Karapetian , the president of L.A , said . Connection , an enterprise that adjusts luxury cars onto customer requirements , he would have sold three car radiator grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that resemble chain bracelets tied together with each other for each 55.000 dollars .
It showed a reporter a car tire which was developed for a Russian casino owner with spokes which it had cladded with colored Swarovski Kristallen so that it looked like a roulette wheel .
The costs : 22.000 dollars for a four substitute .
`` The Russian millionaire , the bunch leather wheels ' or a picture of the face of his wife of cubic zirconium would like to have '' , will not `` go '' unconditional on these wheels '' , Mr Karapetian said .
`` He will keep it in his 30 or 40-cars ' garage . ''
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich , Mr Karapetian said the phrase `` Russiche Millionäre '' would currently not express a lot of exclusivity faced with the rise of the local immovable prices .
`` If you three or four years ago have bought an apartment in Moscow , they are already presumably millionaire , at least on the paper , when already not in cash '' , he said .
`` There are more of those ones than you believe . ''
Those ones , that no millionaires could be at least so to do as if they were rich at a state that was practiced from Alliance Continental , a Russian property administration enterprise .
The enterprise had set up four red telephone boxes according to British Model which were crammed with mountains of wrong million-Dollarscheinen .
Azad Karryev , the marketing director of the enterprise , said his employees would have printed 500.000 wrong bank notes for the millionaire fair .
Passers-by stopped in order to throw around the money heaps , mobile telephone photos , while they are leaning back among the replacement fortune , to make be punched from friends , or simply past a few a million put in .
`` See in Moscow everyone as a millionaire can feel '' , Mr Karryev said .

Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades of the crew of the International space station ( EAT ) will have needed more than seven hours in the space in order to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar thermal collector which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific works on the station .
A risky exit that achieved several records due to his duration , the distance of habitable modules , the quickness with which it was organized , and the tools made by the astronauts in order to carry on the repair .
The problem occurred on Wednesday , when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery , a big cylindrical part that is supposed to include soon the European and Japanese scientific labs .
This module is a kind of pier for the module-labs .
But one must be able to supply it with stream .
It was the second task of the crew therefore to turn over a 17,5 tons heavy module for the electric power production above solar thermal collectors which was already on the ISS in order to bring it into his final position .
After she had moved it , the crew got down to the restructuring of the solar thermal collector of the module whose span is 76 meters .
And it happened , that one of the commutators that can be folded as accordions was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of approximately a meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the commutator anymore yet .
The astronauts who leave the space shuttle Discovery originally for a control walk and then should repair other solar thermal collector whose rotation system was faulty saw themselves forced to dedicate oneself to the damaged commutator .
And Scott Parazynski was selected , to stroll around at the end of the 30 meters long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to that of the station in order to carry out the repair .
He is one of the best Spacewalker ( Wetraumgänger ) of theNASA .
Large , resistant , very sent , he has a well developed upper body and long arms .
The 46-jaehirige learned doctor was selected therefore , to operate on the hurt solar thermal collector .
After he had examined the damages exactly , it cut the faulty cable and attached a kind of rails on the damaged place .
He was supported by a second Spacewalker to stay near the sluice , and , of inside , of the other astronauts , among them Peggy Whitson , commander of the crew .
The astronauts had devised the tool which he used , a mini hockey stick , wrapped around with insulator in order to prevent an electric stroke on the solar thermal collectors which produce several hundreds of volts , on board the station and made the tool which he used , a mini hockey stick , wrapped around with insulator in order to prevent an electric stroke on the solar thermal collectors which several hundreds of volts produce .
When the action was ended , Scott Parazynski waited , until the commutator was completely folded , before he counted his tools and before he turned his tools back into the station .
Yesterday afternoon enjoyed the astronauts half a day of relaxation , before seven astronauts turned round today onto the space shuttle Discovery back in order probably to enter upon the moving-flight to the earth Wednesday .

The fathers of the cabbage skirt return
Germany 's supergroup of the seventies plays music again : The three volume members of Harmonia planned their consoles once again at a concert in Berlin .
To the Revival a monitoring appears from their large time '' Live in 1974 '' .
Already then it was abroad considerably more famous .
The arranged sensation happens then in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening board .
Everyone has his box in front of themselves , his cables and particularly his buttons .
Dieter Möbius thrones in the blossom-white shirt with 63 years inthe middle .
To the left flanked by Michael Rother , 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar .
To the right , considered from the auditory , bends Hans-Joachim Rödelius , 73 , concentrated at the console .
Everyone contributes noises , sometimes even a Beat .
And sometimes it matches by mistake to a traditionalpiece of music .
That seems not to disturb also the gentlemen themselves then in a largeway .
That the band Harmonia plays music again worried among cabbage skirt lovers for some excitement .
At what here may reveal : Purposeful demands did not show that the name buzzed indeed through the collective pop memory , however , by no means so lastingly in order to miss this band painfully since 32 years .
But why is also the German not supposed to be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the Siebziger years ?
Especially as what is called Krautrock misleadingly was valid always more in England and America than in the own country .
When the music economy awarded the survivors of the group of Can 2003 of Cologne with the reverberation-price for the life 's work , one looked in the hall into asking German pop faces .
As the Red Hot chili Peppers in the eulogy also still near the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu ! thanked , the amazement did not know any borders .
In the case of concerts Michael Rother sat later with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage as an old pal .
The problem of the ignorance at home and the transfiguration abroad isone .
The memory is already therefore overtaxed because the trio existed only two years and unfolded also a far smaller effect power in this time than they subsequently were assigned to by other with Harmonia .
Möbius and Rödelius had played music already before with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the name cluster promising a lot .
First of all one played in the cellar under the Berlinshow stage .
After that in Düsseldorf , for economical reasons for a plate label maintained by the church .
Rother had helped out shortly near power station and connecting oneself as a guitarist at Neu ! , the then maybe most radical German group , a call erspielt .
Around 1973 Rother followed , however , the cluster-musicians into the exile after forest in the Weser mountain country .
There , in the Old Weser yard , a ruin from the 16th century , they lived as city-fugitive Kommunarden .
Less ideological than in the commune I , where Rödelius was still allowed to take pains as a nurse .
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist existence .
Also a pennon of the song association Harmonia Ottenstein was found alleged in the bulky waste and for the art a name .
Some held Harmonia of that .
`` Music of Harmonia '' and the following `` De Luxe '' was called thefirst album .
Because so calmly and modestly the music also rang , the band suffered from material need .
The brushwood compiling was not used only for the Selbstfindung .
The now appeared CD `` Live in 1974 '' was logged at a concert in Griessem , before a just 50-headed record scenery , how anyone to remember believes .
The wish came of Rother then , Harmonia to force and to practice sometimes .

Who here `` '68 ! '' calls , does not have very improperly , and Harmonia can not be brought from that also now from the rest .
Still the most natural thing is reconsidered on the stage thoroughly .
Where does music begin and when does it stop ?
That can rob one of the nerves or give to fleeting moments of great luck .

Banks want to overcome crisis
The American Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain , Switzerland and Canada decided on fighting against the crisis together on the financial markets .
So more than 100 billion dollars will reach by means of auctions onto the currency markets .
On these auctions the banks interest rates auction , to which they are ready to lend money mutually .
For example the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction , wider she forks out 24 for the European one and the Swiss central bank .
It is after the assaults of the 11.September the first time that the central banks of the single states agree on a so coordinated procedure to the defense and/or Abmilderung of the consequences of a financial crisis .
`` This step is supposed to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy , therefore '' Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote `` the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend '' in a report for his customers .
`` The probability of a recession reduced the coordinated action of the central banks in the USA of 65 % on about 50 % '' , Baumohl added in his report .
The banks lost because of not operated credits already around 60 billion dollars , particularly in the United States .
Analysts expect even further billion losses .
`` This central banks must have been afraid of what still everything can follow when decided on this procedure real '' the chief economist of ABN Amro , Kieran Davies , said .
`` It looks like this that the situation is in fact bad '' he passed on .
The central banks have the apprehension that if the banks themselves have access to loans heavily , to become also more expensive for their customers credits .
That would reduce the consumption and to fling the American economy into a recession , possibly with effects on the economic growth on the whole world .
The central banks decided to that after their not having succeeded in it on lowering the so-called LIBOR , the London interbank interest rate that is used with the money rental company between banks .
That means that the banks were afraid continuously to lend money mutually , and that although the central banks of the USA , Canada and Great Britain during the fall had lowered their interest rates repeatedly .
`` That will have the same effect as a further drawdown of the interest rates '' , Greg Salvaggio of tense said to consulting of the agency of Reuters .
Some analysts think that this step of the central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem and indeed the case of the property market in the USA .

Food guilty at European inflation
The food prices in a fast way increasing are main reason for the rise of the inflation measured in the euro zone .
In the 13 countries of the euro zone the price increase was in November higher than expects - after that 2.6 percent in October was registered an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent , reported as the Statistical Office the EU in Luxembourg .
Official predictions took only 3 percent as a basis , Bloomberg announced .
Unlike the American , British , and Canadian issuing bank the European central bank ( EZB ) did not lower the Leitzsins . According to your discretion the increasing raw material prices and the easy drop of the unemployment would favor the origin of an inflationary spiral the reduction of the rate of interest .
The EZB is eager to hold the inflation rate under two percent , or at least just at the two Percent-brand .
According to an analyst the EZB is in the fix : One must `` arrange '' the inflation in order to exclude later action need .
With 3,3 percent the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve Year record high ; in Spain the rate climbed from 3,6 on 4,1 percent .
The climbed food and energy prices are responsible for the rise of the inflation in the euro zone .
The MATIF wheat notations climbed around 88 percent , and the course in soybeans reached also a record high since 1973 .
Also with edible oil and milk products there was aconsiderable price increase in 2007 .
The world market price for crude oil increased this year around 52 percent - in the last month the price reached dollar to almost 100 US per barrel of the black gold .
According to the EZB the inflation will climb in the year 2008 from 2,1 on 2,5 percent , however , one counts in 2009 with a drop on 1,9 percent .
For the coming 3-4 months analysts take a 3-percent inflation rate as a basis , number the annual average rate , however , with 2,1 percent .
For 2008 experts reckon that the EZB will decrease the intereststwice .

England confronted with decision on the statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas , each of them in an almost just as difficult way asthe other one .
Who is supposed to beat as a number 6 for England into Kandy at this weekend , Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara ?
And , not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka , who is supposed to make the decision ?
The second question is important , because David Graveney , the choice chairperson , on call at least under this specific title , here is , around which to help Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan with deciding manager , and because the table of High Morries , the English managerial director , fills itself with applications for national voter offices by degrees , otherwise even for which ones in partial time .
Whoever does not get the sixth brawler position will be unhappy , but the life is often unfair and the sport is it beyond doubt .
It is never simple to nail exactly what a human being facilitates to reach the top of his of Berufszweiges while somebody is differently never coming out about the lowest rank sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability .
It is not only in the cricket where the selection , where judgments which are always at the end subjective are necessary , is difficult .
It is the correct time for Bopara climb up ?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it ?
That resembles can be asked maybe also in one further field , whether for example John Edwards or `` Tubby '' Banerjee should be conveyed , both intelligent young managers with good ends that know the business well .
Who can say what the correct class is for a cricketer , unless , the possibility to swim or to sink is given to him .
As a matter of course numbers have a great influence on decisions , but chances also have this .
Within a team a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain to the correct time , if it can take a Wicket and a brawler must get regular chances on the order if it wants to do impression as a one-day cricketer .
To catch the eyes of the selectors is more complicated .
There were many which were better in the last season than , for example , as James Anderson , who will play seemingly in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares itself as healthy and bowls as the wind into the nets .
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with each 33 runs in order to earn a position in this tour .
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average , but they both had their highlights and hope for still more .
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiriya Stadium can be only an opinion question .
The choice could decide on the careers of both men , or nevertheless maybe it does little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first , with five Wickets and 40 useful runs , it was , however , Paul Collingwood to consolidate then still fightingly around himself that created the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and that , although it scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia , maybe still is underestimated .
Probable is , that Graveney , Vaughan and bog , after a further discussion in the course of the present net meeting in the Asgiriya Stadium will follow their conservative instincts and stomach feeling for Shahs greater experience above Boparas youthful enthusiasm .
There are arguments for both of them .
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 Test-Debüt-Innings into Bombay , 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara that is younger with 22 years seven years , and an excellent balance against rolling turned on .
But Shah did Indies only ten runs in his two Innings in the May against west in the test in lord , his home arena as a player from Middlesex , and this , plus his immediate refusal of the selectors as Vaughan healthy was in order to take back his position for the next game it seems to have taken the swing that was still manifest in Bombay from his beating .
In Contrast the all-rounder has shovel-wise high spirits from Essex .
It is not impressed from anything on a cricket place and was brought his attitude off on the point , than he had estimated a vehicle with four wheel drive recently in an exhibition for England 's sponsor Volkswagen .
He suffered smaller injuries and presumably a shock , but the First that he did was his Vodafone ( natural also gesponsort ) to get out and to call his team colleague Alastair Cook that had observed this from the distance , and to say his team colleague Alastair Cook that had observed this from the distance with enthusiasm : `` You saw that '' ? .
Bopara is a much better field player , he bowls his central speed with some effect here on the grounds , what it seems to match to it and beats with confidence and fate .
To elect the correct man is a thing , to choose the correct time another .
Maybe that is the actual art of the selection .
I bend for this purpose his chance to give to Bopara now , what does not mean that nevertheless maybe Shah will not stand good if , suggested as the tea sentence from Ceylon , he is that one that will play here this weekend .

Gallup locates government crisis
After long stagnating the number of the Fidesz-sympathizers grew until beginning of December considerably . First times since 2002 the party has the biggest base warehouse while the approval was reaching a never yet been low of 13 percent for the socialists according to Gallup .
With the party-loyal voters the difference turns out thanks to the high determination of the opposition proponents clearly : More than two thirds ( 71 percent ) stand a fifth ( 20 percent ) opposite approval for the MSZP .
MDF and SZDSZ lie according to inquiry under the parliamentary entrance hurdle : You come in the total population to two percent .
The number of the party voters grew in bothwarehouses around a percent .
In the comparison to the last low the general economical atmosphere kept on worsening - never before yet the part of those that judge the economic position of the country `` badly '' as being `` expressed '' was not so high ( 41 percent ) while further 46 percent of them are holding for `` quite bad '' .
According to more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer the families see the change of their financial situation once again more pessimistic .
For the coming year the majority of the population reckons a further deterioration of the situation ; only a tenth goes out of an improvement .
A Gallup-inquiry carried out in December showed that 71 % of the interviewees - a historical high - `` judged '' the work of the prime minister as bad `` rather than right '' .
Thirteen percent of the interviewees have great confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány while the part of the proponents is forming 38 percent for Viktor Orbán .
In about 54 % do not trust the head of the government at all , compared with 27 % of distrust of the party leader of the Fidesz .
One of the indicators of the political atmosphere is the number of those , mine , one could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister also without government changes into the grip .
Had themselves to the riots in last October still expressed 35 % for the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government , this part amounts today only to another 20 % while the relative majority ( 33 percent ) is seeing the solution only in new choices .
Asked for their interest at the plebiscite answered 60 percent , that they participate `` with security '' , and would give further 20 % their vote `` probable '' .
For the comparison : if the parliament choices occurred on this Sunday , only 55 percent `` with security '' would go to the urns , further 15 % hold their participation for `` probable '' . Faced with these tendencies the result of the plebiscite would be forseeable .
74 % would become against the tuition fees , 79 % against the practice fee , and 84 % against the hospital day money make .
Moved onto the group that at the plebiscite `` with security '' The parts of the opponents of the study , practice and hospital fees would become to participating even 81 , 84 , and/or 89 percent are .

High days are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary holidays are controlled so that the practice of the planning of the working days established itself in the meantime around the holidays , however , given by law exactly us the coming year little such days .
Also in the EU and in America one means something different by '' holiday '' .
The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and work-free days .
Work-Free Days are mostly ecclesiastical holidays , or are related with significant historical events .
We celebrate for example also New Year : Both the last day of the old one , as also the first day of the new year work-free days are - latter alone to be able to rest already with that the New Year 's Eve revelers .
In the whole year we have in total fourteen holidays .
The state holidays are the 15th March to remind of the revolution of 1848 , and the 23rd October , the commemoration day of the revolution of 1956 .
On 20th August the state foundation is celebrated on 1st May the work , at the 1st and 2nd November we commemorate our dead woman .
In addition there are each two holidays to Easters , Whitsun , andChristmas .
There ours State- , National- or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall , the practice of the `` working day shift '' persisted in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday only a day .
The price of the prolonged weekends is , however , that we very presumably work on the Saturdays in front of that , or must go into the school .
When this day , that before or after the holiday falls , final is supposed to be worked off , is defined since long years by the work minister in an own regulation .
The right regulation is valid for all work donor and taker , for public employees and officials of the public service equally .
Only companies and facilities are excluded , in which the company without interruption is carried on , therefore also on the holidays .
The working regulations are only still brought to wage a little messily by the holidays at the end of the year : From the 24th December the life conks out in these parts ceremonially since most take time balancing , or the vacation especially picked up for that for the days between Christmas and New Year 's Eve .
In the next year more holidays fall into the week middle , and/or onto the end of the week so that there will be less rescheduling at the working days than this year .
The calendar is put first on the head around the day of the work so that the people can remain four days now at the piece at home .
Saturday , the 26th April becomes a working day , in this way the Friday , 2nd May a rest day can be .
The second rescheduling is associated with the holiday on 23rd October : On Saturday , which 18th October becomes one the Friday , to have to work off 24th October first of all .
The end of the year will completely stand , however , in the sign of the holidays after from the 24th December it remains to lie everything and to stand even if New Year 's Eve fells on a Wednesday .

Political Capital : Hungarian guard increases state risk
In the view of the department of risk analysis ( Risk Analysing Division ) of Political Capital the activities began the Hungarian 's founded in this August with support of the `` movement for a better Hungary '' guard the risk Hungary 's and the region 's in several respect .
In the `` risk warning report '' of the institute it is called among other things : In Connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard the highest political risk sets the `` sharpening of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary dar , that could lead to violent ethnic quarrels even at short notice '' .
Main reason for that is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which presumably aims at the provocation of such a quarrel , according to the research institute .
How tells looks this as a lapse on the part of the political persons responsible : `` Persons of the public life left the discussion of the Roma-question with representatives of radical political grouping who now based their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian-contrast '' .
One presumes , that this the problem intensify , to make the reasonable dialog impossible , extremities favor as soon as the probability of violent quarrels would increase .
The Forschungsinsitut in addition thinks the activities of the Hungarian Guard would have last but not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media , `` the picture of Hungary abroad considerably damaged , in particular what `` affects '' the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity .
We remember : Since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups is continuous in Hungary in the upswing , so that since summer 2007 several were founded , `` national self-defense association '' naming organizations .
`` This grouping is common , that they call themselves as civilian organization in each case while they are boasting about that openly their members on - sometimes armed - defense tasks of preparing ( Disaster protection , national defense , Ordnungshütung ) , under appointment on the unsuitability of the police , the army , and/or the state itself , '' called it .
And wider : That all happens according to that method , that one attempts to camouflage as middle class initiative attempts different , based onto the political and party moroseness of the population , political .
The stress of the civilian character and the association form are only not used therefore for the avoidance of juridical hurdles that could emerge in the course of the registration near court - it is at the same time a political strategy .
As is to be understood from the analysis , the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent a risk-increasing factor also for the relationships with the neighboring states .
`` In the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighboring states as a potential safety hazard , some ultranationalistischer politician of certain neighbor countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of his own anti-Hungarian politics .
That all has effects on the political stability of the region - '' it was called '' .
From the Viewpoint of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in central-east-Europe , thus the political risk increased for the entire region .
As tells , the activities are comparable to the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian National Guard , whose foundation in August 2007 was announced of the right-extreme Bulgarian 's National union ( BNU ) .
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard the Roma mass outrages which occurred in a quarter of Sofia ( Krasna Poljana ) stood .
The BNU took as an opportunity the incidents for the foundation of the National Guard now , with the argument that the objective of the organization is the `` national protection '' .
In your opinion a regular `` gypsy terror '' was indeed perceptible in the last 17 years in Bulgaria , the state remained , however , idle and indifferent - so Political Capital .
And wider : The initiative would have kicked a vehement debate loosely in the Bulgarian public .
As saidly , the increased risk for ethnic quarrels is proved also by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to resistance purposes .
There the activities of the Hungarian Guard up to now many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard shows , not to exclude it is , that the Hungarian Roma also , it means to react to the threats with the organizing of their own protection , in the risk warning report by Political Capital .
Attila Juhász , research director with Political Capital said on demand the news agency : The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute .
Annually risk analysis reports would be published , and should be recognizable risk-changing tendencies , the public opinion is informed , as in the case through the publication of the risk warning-report .

Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
On the Philippines rebelling soldiers who had entrenched themselves behind a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall from president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo gave up .
He can not account for any bloodshed , the chief Antonio Trillanes who reproached the president for corruption and choice fraud said to reporters in the hotel .
Government-Loyal Soldiers had stormed the hotel before by tear gas application .
The about two dutzend soldiers had entrenched themselves since hours behind the building .
About half of them protruded on Thursday because of a failed coup d'etat attempt in the year 2003 court - among them Trillanes .
It used the negotiations in order to drop oneself off suddenly with about 30 sympathizers .
Apparently the military policemen who should guard it actually had overflowed to it and followed his mutiny .

Loyal government troops shut off the district around the distinguishedhotel .
The president called an urgent meeting of thesecurity cabinet .
The national security consultant Norberto Gonzales condemned the procedure of the soldiers .
`` The people have enough '' , Trillanes said .
`` We appeal to the people to follow us . ''
General Danilo Lim who formerly commanded over the elite unit of the Scout Rangers said other army-units wanted to follow the march shortly .
Government critics had called for Friday for great demonstrations against the president .
Your government is overshadowed since months of corruption reproaches .
Manila 's finance district was in already 2003 main scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military members against Arroyo .
The revolt failed after just 24 hours because of the refusal of the army to connect oneself .
Since 1986 there were already at least seven coup d'etat attempts against democratically elected governments on the Philippines .

The 47 million documents of the archive that are placed on an overall length of 27 km in bath Arolsen could not be inspected until now , unless with a humanitarian intention , therefore individual and name-gotten , therefore on query of a former victim or his members .
The eleven charged their administration Staaten- under that Germany , France , Israel and the USA- agreed in May 2006 on making it accessible to researchers and historians .
After the ratification process of this decision was finished , the opening is since yesterday valid .
Tricky information
The access of the historians to bath Arolsen will make it possible to practice enquiries particularly about the deportations of prisoners , the occupants of the concentration camps and the health state of the mandatory workers declares Reto Meistern , conductor of these archives , that of the International committee of the Red cross ( CICR ) are administered .
Until recently still several states were , under that also Germany against making these name-related documents accessible to the public due to the particular character of certain information .
As for example the alleged homosexuality or the intellectual hindrance of some deportation victims .
The occupant listen of the concentration camps or the warrants of arrest exhibited by Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical reason : To find civilians who had been deported or subordinated to the forced labor , and to provide them with a confirmation of their arrest possibly in order to smooth the way for their compensation for them so .
Still today more than 300 celebration employees work in bath Arolsen zehntausende personal inquiries .
Nevertheless , a part of the scientific community shows only a restricted interest in the access to bath Arolsen .

The Spanish private sender Telecinco doubles his market value and in an outdated way thus his rival Antena 3 for the first time .
We created it .
With this sentence the manager of Telecinco , Paolo Vasile , made his contentment known with stock exchange end . The sender guided by it had increased his value around the twofold one of his rival Antena 3 .
An aspect , however , subdued his joy : That is exactly that something me is hurt ; not , that we a higher growth , but , he stated that we had smaller losses .
It stressed that they did not sink in spite of the weak market far too deeply .
Telecinco ended yesterday the day with a plus of 2,54 % .
This profit reduces his previous this year 's losses on 15,66 % .
According to information of Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4.488,88 million euros at which Mediaset controls the main part of the capital ( 52 % ) , and is shared to Vocento only with 13 % now .
The rival Antena 3 lost 1,52 percent points yesterday and has to announce since January a loss of in total 40,5 % so that his market value with 2.193,46 million amounts to half .
The market value of other stock exchange-noted communication enterprises on the other hand climbs ; in the case of Sogecable on 3.571 million , at Prisa ( Editor of the magazine Cinco Días ) on 2.518,53 million and at Vocento on 1.779 million .
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is a question of two similar enterprises , according to Vasile .
Still the question in which extent in fact we stock exchange technically can act appears uncertain for which price and as we can design it lucratively on customer level .
Telecinco explained his intention to climb up from advertising-gains this year to the first television broadcast station with more than 1000 million gross profits a week ago . This insured Guiseppe Tringali , the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña , the advertising-enterprise of the group .
If the intention should be turned over , the sender would increase his advertising-revenues by 3,6 % in comparison with the 965,4 million from the previous year .

The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange course of Telecinco better in the comparison at the high Payout reason , that the company could show up to the present time : In 2006 the enterprise guided by Alejandro Echevarría arranged for a 100-prozentige dividend distribution .
Vasile insures , however , that the reason after the purchase of 33 % of the parts of final moles , with media set as a holding company , still could vary , even if it is still too early for an official announcement .
We are obliged to the official compromise , to pay at least 50 % of the parts even if we have declared more up to now always considerably .
I hope for our being able to satisfy our stockholders whose stock values we could already increase through the purchase from 33 % of the final mole parts this year .
According to statement of the analysts themarket points at the time of certain loss tendencies on .
Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently his profit calculation around 7 % at Telecinco for this year around 4 % and for 2009 .
This is the consequence of the shortening of the probable growth rate which will go back to 8,4 % and 2009 in 2008 of 10,5 % from 5,5 % on 5,1 % .
This reduced also the probable profit calculation from Antena 3 for 2008 around 4,5 % and for 2009 around 7,5 % .
3 options .
1 .
Ibersecurities : comes down his high effective net yield and be lasting potential and recommends therefore the purchase of both stocks .
2 .
Caja Madrid : Telecinco attributes ( to buy ) due to the multiple stimuli and the prosperierenden market a more useful position than Antena 3 ( to hold ) .
3 .
JPMorgan : recommends faced with the similar threats to neglect ( satisfied market and worse economic climate ) the expectations in both cases

Nicaraguan court confirms twenty year long prison sentence for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty year long prison sentence for the former president Arnold Alemán to whom he had been condemned in 2003 because of finance fraud at the level of 100 million dollars ( almost 1,8 billion crowns ) .
Later , however , he had been released from the prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda near the nicaruanischen metropolis .
Whether the former head of state ( 1997 to 2002 ) of this Central American state finds out grating again is currently unclear according to the AP news agency .
According to the chairperson of the court of appeal , Ileana Pérez , it will depend now on the custody officials whether one makes Alemán sit out his punishment at home or whether it into the prison must .
A court proved that Alemán had moved money of the government regularly onto accounts of foreign companies in Panama four years ago .
These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in reality to his relatives and narrowest supporters .
Some of this money landed finally in a fund that Alemán for the financing of his election campaign 2001 had established .

Card sharks
Does the credit crisis of Americas infectKreditkartenmarkt ?
If blood is in the water , it is is only natural , that dorsal fins spin annoyed .
Now where Americas ' property market kränkelt , the predators have the credit card market of the country in the visor .
Analysts of Goldman Sachs reckon that the credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the danger of infection of unterfinanzierten credits onto other forms of verb smoking credits spreads .
Signs of the strain are clearly visible .
There are rises both at the Ausbuchungen and with the delay rates which measure the part of the credits which are not too late in each case in a retractable way or more than 30 days .
The HSBC announced in the last month that it took one to 1,4 billion dollars fee elevation from their American consumer financing partial because of the weakness of credit card takers .
Nevertheless it is too early in order to sink into panic .
Losses and delays are still low .
According to the rating agency Moody the Drittquartals-Säumnissrate of 3.89 % was almost a full percent point under the historical average .
The deterioration with the rates can be explained partially by technical factors .
A change in the American private insolvency right laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case from bankruptcy registration that form in turn for a big part of the Keditkartenverluste ; the number of the registration ( and in this way delay fees ) would go up again , whether the general conditions for applicants for the credit worsen or not .
The industry reports also about sound payment rates which show how much of their debts the consumers pay off every month
and the confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong , in spite of the standstill in other corners of the structured financing .
Catalan-English English-Catalan Catalan-Spanish Spanish-Catalan Catalan-French French-Catalan English-French English-German English-Italian English-Russian English-Spanish French-English French-German French-Spanish German-English German-French German-Spanish German-Russian Russian-English Russian-German Spanish-English Spanish-French Spanish-Galician Spanish-German

The card exhibitors look , however , at the money river instead of onto capital values , therefore falling house prices do not activate of necessity a change in the creditworthiness of the applicant for the credit .
You can be even for the card exhibitors of advantage .
The stimuli for consumers , to keep on paying the mortgage rates , sink if the immovables are less value than the value of the loan ; as a result the card debts become more important under the repayment priorities .
Card exhibitors can react to the stormier conditions also much more quickly and more flexibly as credit grantors when they change interest rates or credit borders .
That should reduce theoretically the risk of a fast re-evaluation of the capital values .
`` We will not wake up one day and completely revalue the loans '' , Gary Perlin , Capital Ones main finance speaker , says .
Even if a sudden shortage crisis is improbable in the credit card market , the risks of a lasting downturn are considerably more real .
If lower house prices and a credit decrease America are urgent into the recession , the industry will stand beyond doubt a grimmer future ago .
They keep on holding look-out to these shark fins .

Small Saarland , good education
The smallest federal state is during the professional training carrying on and shines even with the international direction of his colleges .
Only in an education field the same deficit presses the Saarlanders as the rest of the country .
`` I have'declared to a non-Saarlander yesterday for the 50th time , that we are not French - this slogan plakatiert the smallest federal state selfironic to his 50th birthday '' .
In this case France and Luxembourg play a big role in the education system of the Saarland which lies in the education monitor of the institute of the German economy Cologne ( IW ) on place five .
So the colleges co-operate already from tradition withthe neighbor countries closely .
The university in Saarbrücken was set up in 1948 of the French .
Until today studying keep up their study here one double or three compartment diploma close .
The part is correspondingly high foreign Studying with 15,6 percent .
However Saarland brings also the subjects onto the colleges in number above average - many of them without an end at the grammar school .
`` In Saarland one uses the professional education system '' , Axel Plünnecke , education expert , says at the IW .
More than every fifth young person gains his study authorization at a vocational school , Saarland lies in this way more than seven percent points above the federal average .
Also the possible combinations of professional and academic training are comparably strongly built up .
The equipment with dual courses of studies is measured by the population number the second-best one in Germany .
In spite of the practical training and increasing demand the number of the engineer graduates in the last years , however , around a third sank .
For that the Saar education ministry obliged the colleges to a marketing campaign now for engineer-scientific compartments .
`` At the general education schools we initiated according to the first Pisa-study many reforms '' , a speaker of the education ministry says .
So the government introduced national benchmark tests .
In this way the children to begin formerly to learn is the last Kita year free of charge - a model that meanwhile also other federal states copy .
First future comparison studies will show whether the services of the pupils improve lastingly .
Near Pisa 2003 the part of the risk pupils of 29 on 20 percent shrank .
In total Saarland did not increase itself as strongly , however , as other federal states did .
The Bavarians calculate better .
And for the annoyance of the Saarlanders Fremdsprachenkenntnise are not measured near Pisa - in this field one could score otherwise .
Because the language of the neighbors is duty at grammar schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French .

Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister for the environment , gábor fodor bekanntgab , the meeting of experts on Tuesday at the end , and the debate on the international climate regime is after 2012 by the ministers on Wednesday the official opening .
Experts and politicians from discussing 192 countries on the road map of Bali , in which the emission reduzierenden measures for the period after 2012 , after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol are established .
There is a heated debate between developed and developing countries in progress .
The USA has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate on specific figures , but would you be prepared to the greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 to reduce 25-40 % .
The other great issue of the conference is whether the industrial countries are ready , apart from the reduction of emissions in the developing countries , both financially and technologically .
It was also an agreement on support for developing countries .
The Kyoto Protocol implied adjustment fund should be managed by a 16-köpfigen Council , probably in the Global Environmental Facility ( gef ) of the UN , as in the piac profit is all és ' .
Hungary six per cent
Environment Minister gábor supports fodor on behalf of Hungary the aspiration of the EU , its pioneering role in global climate measures to be retained until 2009 , and a new international agreement .
The Minister said that the EU will be the year 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduced by 20 % ( from 1990 levels ) , irrespective of whether the 'convention ' after 2012 success will be reached , or the Union would not even be willing to use a 30-prozentige reduction , soferne other major industrial countries of the world , or developing countries are also prepared for its commitments and responsibly .
Gábor fodor stressed that the objective of the States that have signed up to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 , a reduction of only 5.2 % , whereas the EU of the 15 Member States at the time to a reduction of 8 % was required .
The target for Hungary is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 6 % in comparison to the years 1985-87 - a figure that will meet the country , as the press release is all department of the environment .
The stakes are high in Bali - after all , the long-term international climate political agreement within a period of two years , otherwise it would be ready to enter into force only after 2012 and , in this case would be laid down in the Kyoto Protocol reduction project , not a new system of international emission consequences , the importance of which the IPCC , the international , with the Nobel Peace Prize climate excellent scientific committee of the UN in its latest report .
That would delay the reduction in emission levels , and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable , according to the wissenschaftern extremely serious and irreparable consequences .

Klaus debates the ecologists is quite incredible .
Global climate change damage claims in the majority of developing countries .
President Vaclav Klaus , back to the problem of global warming .
The criticism referred to the drawing to the UN International Conference on climate change in Bali .
In Vienna , where his book 'a blue , green planet ' , he was presented , that the debates of the ecologists quite incredible .
Klaus , not only the structure of the conference , which is unacceptable in a strange mixture of government representatives and of such cases of organisations , but also aware of the fundamental difference between the rhetoric , which you , begleite and the reality of the situation .
The debate is unstrukturiert there , it is a point that feuerwerk replacement is only for a real solution to the current problems , `` said Klaus .
The Czech President said in his book the idea that the issue is very important to him , and that it is therefore committed to it .
It made its satisfaction about the fact that the German translation appear in his book ' , because I often make my views on cartoons . '
It could therefore be interested to read it out and undistorted .
Klaus pointed out that it is not a klimatologe , but he is of the opinion that sufficient conditions for such a paper .
It is , after all , academics , able to technical pamphlets to understand and to assess with statistics have experience and should also be public economists .
The main thrust of the book he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore quite natural to global warming , that there is no consensus amongst scientists , recognise that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and , therefore , is not a threat , and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate , superfluous , ineffective and unacceptable consuming .
It also consider , as the experience of totalitarian sytemen to impose unacceptable other unsubstantiated views that he can see this as a dangerous restriction of freedom .
On issues of present on several occasions , he said that he is not against 'a reasonable environmental protection , but against militant environmental activists , which does not take into account the relationship between effort and yield . '

It is widely used to save
Today , more than a thousand infections in hospitals , registered in an improper use of antibiotics were due .
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals , the overcrowding of beds , the surfeit of personnel - the tide of all factors that are not necessarily the infections , such as the chief doctor of the national epidemiologie # centre .
It is widely used in the right .
In the traumatologie- department of the jános hospital has recently been diagnosed in a mrsa- infection .
The antibiotic-resistant is possible in a male patients , found after a serious accident in hospital .
The patient is isolated .
At the beginning of the year , there was already a similar infection here .
The people of a serious car accident was released from the hospital , the man who had , however , with a mrsa- infection , to return to an important operation since then , because of the bakteriums still in the body of the patients , is still not being carried out .
By 10 December of this year for hospitals 1094 resistant strains infections caused by multinationals in the national nosocomialis surveillance system , so to speak , the chief doctor of the national epidemiologie # centre , karolina böröcz .
So many resistant strains infections caused by multinationals in the hospitals have been registered with safety so that the number of unreported cases is higher .
Around two thirds of the infection ( 683 cases ) , the mrsa , against methicillin-oxacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus .
The staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) is possible , approximately one third of the people in their nose , without that it would cause a disease .
Sa-bedingte infections ( such as hals # , entzündung almond , entzündung inflammations of skin or tend to react wounds ) Well , they are well curable antibiotics .
However , the funds are too high or incorrectly applied extent , due to the good respondierenden antibiotic resistant bacteria , under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly .
Particularly in patients with geschwächtem , or for bad funktionierendem immune system , but also in the elderly , or patients with low body weight , these bacteria serious infections , such as wund # infection or blood poisoning , therefore , sepsis .
The medical head of the hospital jános according to the mrsa- infection is nothing special , these events are among the kranke # House of daily life .
It should not confuse the epidemic , manhte tibor nyulasi - there is mrsa not only there , where they are not .
Resistant to antibiotics
'these patients in isolation , nursing staff will contribute to empty shoes and masks of supplies , and we have the necessary for the treatment of antibiotics ' - so tibor nyulasi .
In its entering the hospital at the patients mrsa , however , does not always an infection can not be avoided .
Very rarely sampling
The majority of the infection triggered by mrsa in hospitals , however , would be avoidable if the current conditions and circumstances detrimental to the control of the creation or the spread of the multinationals , böröcz karolina resistant anthrax .
After this infection found in hospitals and retirement homes , which should examine the hospital with eingelieferten patients and isolate infected mrsa- immediately .
In the Hungarian hospitals , the microbiological samples but not so often .
Not least because on the part of the public health insurance fund is no support for this study .
The majority of cases , therefore , would only come to light the patient , if a bemerk # mrsa- infection , that has the medical head of the epidemiologie # centre .
On the part of the European Union , there are strict recommendations on the use of antibiotics in human medicine , but there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures .
Antibiotic treatments will be targeted , that is to say , microbiological studies are necessary so that no resistance to the resources can be , however , this directive of hospitals , not always respected .
Under the ambulanten , or in the basic needs of patients are microbiological sampling , even less so karolina böröcz .
The cuts are being made used
Scientific evidence demonstrates that a mrsa patients on the other most of the staff .
That is why the handwashing just , or the wearing of gloves and masks a great importance , however , there are also considerable shortcomings in this area in hospitals .
By mrsa infection contact , or rather in the domestic hospitals , but not always the possibility to isolate the infected patients .
The rooms are often overcrowded , the beds , just one , although it is ranked between epidemiological point of view , from a distance of at least 1.5 m .
As karolina further böröcz points out , it is unfortunately less well placed in the financial hospitals even before that used to be saved , there are few nurses , many patients - all factors that actually favour the emergence of infection .
Such infections are much less often proven , or the further spread of the infective agent inactive can not be reversed , where these protection measures are complied with , böröcz karolina .
Against mrsa intergovernmental programme
Mrsa- infections to get to grips with the health insurance caused enormous costs , it will therefore be combatted everywhere .
In England , for example , the prevention of mrsa , or their containment in the legislative programme .
The first signs the programme is successful , as published data show that the trend is the mrsa- infections in England .
The European Centre for Disease Prevention ( ECDC ) , the prevention of the emergence of big resistant cause ( including mrsa ) , and the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities .

 we are aware of the price of a genuine democracy and we hope that honest elections , very clear and open elections without fraud , `` added it .

Since it was elected in 2000 and 2004 , Vladimir Putin can secure not for a third term of office in consequence .
And there is no successor now .

Today ``  abandon the Russians  fated to the personal responsibility , `` after the collapse of the USSR in a short time .

This is a phenomenon that affects all social classes , including the business world .
And the administrative elite is to maintain the status quo : 65 governors ( of 85 Russian regions # chairman ) , the local election lists of the United Russia .
The new , from the West next freedoms are often synonymous with chaos , as in the 1990s .
The general public stability prefers .
In this sense , the Russians will not vote in favour of the extremist parties .

In the islands of the Caribbean , you will find that in überreichlichem level .
You will find only on an island and a great deal more , and these island of Cuba is the biggest and best of the great Antilles .
At the time of the Spanish people whose Cuba bastion of the conquest of America .
The most beautiful place called it head , ever seen a human face .
Havana was once a camp or transit camps of resources , the Spaniards were stolen in America and then transported to Europe .
And then came the American era .
The hotel was Nacional at the end of the 20th century .
Inevitably create one of the leaders of the American mafia , Lucky Luciano , because everything in the United States was regarded as a crime ( particularly during the prohibition on Cuba , was welcomed and supported , gambling , drugs , prostitution .
Under his guests was partly
Winston Churchill , ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
Seen in Havana high-rise blocks , on the broad avenues cars which went to the kult # symbols of the 1950s of last jahrhundets involved .
Ernest Hemingway bought a plots in San Francisco de Paula , near who he had cojímar , and in its jacht .
To the walls of the bodeguita del Medio left stars of the show business and politicians from the whole of America their signatures .
And today ?
To the walls of the bodeguita of Havana can also leave their car grammes .
In the bar in the hotel for you mixt Nacional cocktails entirely satisfactorily .
And the kult # cars drive the fifties until today in Havana , because once and schigulis Fiats imported in the salzigen and auseinandergefallen air feuchten long ago .
Havana may , in particular his eldest , strong , heruntergekommen anywhere in the field , there are so many wonderful colonial sehenswürdigkeiten as it is here .
The other places , for example herausgeputzt Trinidad .
In view of the fact that tourism is the essential means of money , there was the green light to this development .
In the last fifteen years , not only in Havana new hotels , but also in varadero , on the coast of the province of holguín and also , as inselchen cayo Coco cayo Guillermo and others .
Cuba is still a marotte , which is unique in the world , and in particular rail lovers .
The sugar cane plantations from remote methods and dampf- diesel run narrow gauge track to prepare the sugar factories .
Their cars was not renewed for decades and , for example , you putzige and fully functioning locomotives , the same age long elsewhere in the museum .

The bedeutendendsten places , the majority of the people of Cuba .
It must be about varadero Havana to write or not .
We just have to mention that , in the above-mentioned plots of a museum is hemingways , whose visit he who these writer , may not be missed .
The viñales-tal in the west of the island of Cuba is one of the malerischsten .
The many vegetation is growing at lime soil .
The mogotas lime hill , and , -felsen stand out from the steep on talboden in their rooms , there has been a fruitful ground , also by the rock verwitterte areas covered by dichtem bewuchs .
This Valley , where it is perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown .
In its endform can you make to it , if it is one of the zigarren # factories to visit Havana .
Some may find it interesting that the Chilean consequence of the television series of major Zeman 'business ' .
Trinidad
An ancient city , just after the Spanish Members of the island , colonised was established .
Glory and wealth , the trafficking of slaves and sugar .
The wealth represented in the schmucken beauty of the small town .
The Spanish colonial architecture , heavily influenced by the subsequent French settlers , has changed very little for four hundred years .
Trinidad , between the sea and the escambray- mountains , is such an isolated place that it still there in the 1950s of the last century was a road that the area with the rest of the country .
This isolation has helped that this issue was ignored .
Nothing has been built there , but why not demolished , everyone is happy that he had a roof over his head .
If one for Trinidad over a period of time , then this afternoon , it is worthwhile interesting places in the environment , such as the beach playa ancón or the valley of sugar factories .
We should then in the evening in the Casa de la música , which after dark crowded , and where the music until tomorrow is not silent .
Baracoa
This städtchen on the East of Cuba , as some people call the best of the island .
Certainly , this view is also influenced by the way .
Both roads , the Guantánamo , and there must be zerküftete mountains and overcome by a landscape of human intervention , which is only touched upon .
These Eastern outposts of Cuba , the UNESCO thanks to the local untouched nature in their welterbe- list .
There , the best chocolate in the Church , shows the Cross of Columbus ( in fact , it is about a hundred years after the journeys created by Columbus ) , and from the top , where the former Burg , the current hotel , El Castillo , several table mountains , which is the most well-known El yunque .

Auchan at the most expensive , Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the budaörser trading area , this year too , the average increase in price of 16 % of the last year , maintained with the difference this year that there is no increase in VAT .
Article from napi gazdaság
In the budaörser trade triangle , the price of the usual Christmas korbes of this year 'napi 16 % have been increased , but in all hypermärkten over 1 000 huf price increases .
After the prices in the food markets in the last December 'davongaloppiert ' the drastic rise will not prozentuell compared with the already high , former initial level .
However , the consumer is intended to act as a deterrent , and that , in the last year far below 9 000 huf had paid for , this year , not even for 10 , 000 huf is available .
The price of the 'napi ' movement of korbs exceeded the magic 10.000-huf-grenze by at least 91 huf in the markets under scrutiny .
The high price 10.573 huf fraud .
( in 6800 was the price in 6.800 huf . )
The price of fish and living unicum remained almost at last year 's levels have increased considerably , on the other hand , the price of putenbrustfilets poppy , and nuss .
Prices for meal and stick with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary , however , there have been auchan 1kg bread for 139 Ft can raise .
There was the product of competitive price tags fall to less than 200 Ft can .
Also surprising was here two , the price of a litre of Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 Ft can cost , thus including a drink cans huf only 257 .
Nevertheless , this year in the 'average ' napi than warenkorbs- auchan at the most expensive , and cora most advantageous .
Our calculations have shown that the cora prices in the napi 'shopping basket ' of the Christmas prices in the last year , around 15 , while Tesco and each auchan by 18 % .
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of last year and the most expensive of fraud 12 % this year , while the increase between billigstem shopping basket of the last year , and teuerstem 21 % of the current year .
The average price increase in fraud 1.480,00 huf .
The average price increase in the previous year in 1.206,00 Ft can still , however , the VAT mooted in the last Christmas prices .
Precisely this process has taken the trade seriously , it would seem that the movement of houses were difficult to decide what price margin in the individual articles should apply , since the effects of the increase in price on consumers were immense .
( if the traffickers the circulation of a product is a bad thing , it can come about substantial profits in the price range , following the transport intensity . )
The rise will mehwertsteuer- was caused by the 'napi ' movement in the last year korbes so radical that the most expensive basket of the value of 2006 Ft can 1720 exceeded , whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket 844 Ft can simply be fraud .
This year , these extreme not seen as the most expensive basket 1.630,00 Ft can , with more than in the previous year , and even in the cheapest , there has been a price increase of Ft can 1.284,00 .
In comparison of the two last Christmas seasons a disastrous price increase , the price of day-to-day consumer article in the hypermärkten is in less than 20 months have increased by more than 30 % .
( this is not necessarily the data confirmed the Central Statistical Office of Hungary , in some basic foodstuffs , the statistical office in the period of 12 months rise will be more than 30-prozentige .
So in some alongside meal in eggs . )
However , if you look in the napi 'shopping basket ' , it seems almost impossible in respect of the latter , because the price level of the already expensive product in the previous year , even in the worst case , little more than 10 % .
Obviously meal suppliers are in a stronger position than the eilieferanten - after all , they were the drastic price increase to the multinationals .
In the golden triangle of trade , are n't the hypermarkets starting ; it will not constantly reported by good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of consumers in the three at nothing on prices .
There are large quantities of anything , sustainable food in paletten go over the shop tables .
Wednesday morning it was in all three at endless queues in the kassa when suddenly exploded in the number of customers .
However , the country is a lesser frequency of customers , so many multinationals in the opinion researchers , they could not even achieve the planned turnover , and not only in the case of food , but also sustainable consumer goods .

The deterioration in the rates is partly explained by technical factors .
A change in the American private insolvency law in 2005 laws has led to a dramatic change in case of insolvency applications , which in turn represent a large part of the keditkartenverluste ; the number of applications ( and therefore säumnisgebühren ) would return , whether the general conditions for borrowers or not deteriorate .

Mr gere is simply not cynical enough
With 'the hunting party ' and 'murderous peace ' are two films again with the Balkan war .
But both are not convincing .
Either the approaches too much on action and geballer or sentimental but they are too .
There is also Richard gere in 'the hunting party ' .
The good news first : while the war criminals hide Karadzic and Mladic still in the mountains of the Balkans , but it is there , in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war , is now the actors Richard gere has been found .
We have had the most beautiful man in the 1980s , lost from sight , because too many nett- belanglose roles in the fühl # films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism a desire austrieben on inspection .
Richard is now suddenly gere the main argument that 'the hunting party - if the hunted hunters ' ( why should film title are , in fact , always so long , and wirr as lokführer- ? tarifverträge but perhaps .
It provides a wonderful augenzwinkernde presentation : in fact , war is the hunt reporters Simon , which could well have been gere if the fate and the film industry would not help : a man , the best of times , has for a long time , but even in the same ruinen # monument of its decline in considerable vestiges of the former charmes has protected .
But in spite of this , trumpfes ' the hunting party ' , together with the German production ' murderous peace ' , which is also in this week , only the endless series of failed balkankriegs- films .
With 'murderous peace ' , we can make short process : it concerns two German soldiers in Kosovo , topol ( Adrian Max riemelt ) , which is a serbin in Kosovo , to protect the hecken # save a prompt in love with them .
Although it is a good thing that there is not only the Serbs as the root of the evil , will be presented in the television shallow film too quickly in geballer and action .
It is a sort of sounding the alarm for Cobra 11 but without motorway with war .
This can be seen in 'the hunting party ' is a textbook case study , why it is never a good balkan-kriegsfilm .
The history of three us-kriegsreportern , in order to make the Serbian upper war criminals ' , 'the Fuchs track with another director and another the author ( both Richard in shepard ) at a different time perhaps a new ' Apocalypse Now ' .
Because the stories are fairly similar , frappierend both times are small teams in the wood , in order to achieve something , not on the military and on both occasions , there will be a trip to the madness .
One of the reasons for the failure of the hunting party 'is that we do not simply Simon hunt the run-down cynic with heart than the US will be presented at the beginning .
No , the script to a romantic affair to a later Muslim bosnierin andichten murdered .
Finally , 'the ' to go hunting party will be cut if the reporters within the last five minutes in the procedure raffer # succeed , and NATO , the CIA and the head of the world monetary hunters in five years have not managed to achieve : the war criminals and the Muslim Bosnians are left to the fair revenge .
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the cinema logic of justice .
The film has a very human concerns .
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still rumlaufen suspected , and the Americans and the French ( here , for once , it is time to be united in the persecution of secret political agreements not so hard .
But the well-intentioned and this evil is sometimes the case that a similar to a famous poem brecht- in the sense .
It says on the wood form of Asia in the labour dämons before the poet , 'compassionate , I see the geschwollenen stirn # arteries , andeutend : it is like trying to cross ' .
Films as ' the hunting party 'have exactly such schwell # minds but indicate how demanding , it is a good thing .
The problem is not limited to the gender balkankriegs # films .
Recently , this newspaper reports that all major Hollywood flops films in Iraq .
We can also add that there has never been a good südafrika-film .
Almost always applies : if a star or minefields the trouble spots of the world , then herumtreibt is something the results such as ' Rangoon with Patricia arquette ' , ' beyond the borders of jolie Angelina 'or ' blood diamonds ' with Leonardo dicaprio .
It is possible that all the conflicts simply to a close .
After all , it had decades before Hollywood , schindlers list 'with ' a good film dwelling on the Holocaust .
Some film is a mature - which is now in force as a classic works of Vietnam , `` the deer hunter ' , ' Apocalypse Now 'or ' full jacket metal 'are , of course , not at the time to be celebrated championship works .
But perhaps we know today , where each mass murder in real time two screens at home , is simply too much about the conflicts in the world .
And the available the black box , the bedenkenlosigkeit it needs in order to give good stories .
'and ' or 'the great dictator ' are also become so well , and lubitsch Chaplin not yet know how serious the Nazi regime really .
It might not be a good thing if we want to make good films .
Perhaps we must distance sarkastisch artists ' view of the romanciers Lawrence Norfolk .
As the parallels between his historical novel 'lemprières dictionary ' and the Balkan War was consulted , he said : 'It is only that never change a number of things .
Cities will always be very dangerous , people will always be murdered on horrifying way and , as always , there is war in Yugoslavia .

We want to make all rightly - or , as we will be appealing for other
Stop and go-verkehr , the car in the middle of the allmorgendlichen traffic jam .
From the radio erklingt a strange refrain : the tone of a violin , coupled with electronic effects .
I have the discussing now higher volume .
The pace is to change the date for the klängen bass , and as the real klang # a jewel of female chorus .
It is ' wings of love 'of the zagar on mr2 erklingt .
The indigenous music scene has for a long time with the widest scale to quality electropop luxury .
But now , even the congestion , differently if the new album of zagar .
The appearance of yonderboi , thus many new and exciting production from the domestic scene of digital underground- slowly to a change in the overall picture , and even to the garages with his gitarrengequitsche rock in the domestic electropop shows that there are new under the sun .
In pécs Balázs zságer has started musizierte even in the bond , yonderboi before it , perhaps because a wirts # House two pfeifer does not - its own path began .
The breakthrough with his project ( zagar ) and its music , the elements from jazz , electronic and POPs verschmilzt , as it is only concerned with the request that the latest in a cinema fast , komponieren it was approached ( for example ,
'szezon ' of Ferenc török ) .
The formation , which initially appeared in smaller clubs , was only the wider public , known as the Journal 'wan2 their first album from the year 2002 among the top 50 domestic alben reihte and zagar , together with yonderboi , almost one , even in the West kürte marketable trend setter .
There is no doubt that zagar and his band were 'trendy ' , but it is not interested , whether they also want this brand .
The bond has reacted as it should be : with a new , better album .
This new appeared album entitled ' can not walk fly instead ' could open up new paths , but is the title of the desire for continuity with the pécser years .
The expression stems from the time when Balázs zságer even with a different bond .
The luftige , flying reference would indeed be in order , but it is not only the ätherischen nature of music , the spirit and the trends gitarre appropriate - fair , the influence of the coat '-roll is ' n ' .
With this , the liedern in England and living with the bond 'the jigsaw puzzle ' working in the ligeti singer György first in the millenáris .
A song of the album has even managed to the radio - which has been hit by neuestem early morning until late origin popmusik mr2 petöfi has , with the hörern wings of love '' no ' , the participation of six domestic sängerinnen ' ( 'under # divas ' ) , the ohrwurm gradually .
So everything in order ( ? ) .
The . Hvg Hu has zságer demand in Balázs .
. Hvg Hu : this new bestseller raises the question : what is your music reserved for a certain class ?
Balázs zságer : the term 'shift music ' is not just a lot .
In my opinion , there are two box in the popmusik , not mainstream and under # ground , or alternatively and POPs , but commercially and honest .
Even the so-called proposing alternative or underground- music and can be rather meaningless , but as you can only be produced for the sale of commercial power to music .
A good pop-nummer can arise from an honest motive .
The willingness of the hörers will also work on that principle of languages and independent national borders .
. Hvg Hu : you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience with your music ?
Example . Zs : abroad , especially West of us has the popmusik greater tradition .
Because not only on twens teenagers or konzerte , but also the elderly audience .
They are the trends in the popmusik , around them much more closely , because they have for a part of the contemporary culture .
. Hvg Hu : what role will the audience in your work ?
It is important that those who , when you hear how music ?
Example . Zs : it is of course a good sense , to see that more and more to our concerts .
But we have never komponiert for the market .
We are not the music , in order to serve a purpose , but for a particular reason .
The role of the public is performing too greatly , where there has already been a mutual interaction , but it is only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment .
Nonetheless , I am struck by one thing : are you going to make it all right , but if you are not more interesting .
. Hvg Hu : as far möchtest you follow the example of yonderboi ?
It is the solist and his career has rather built in the West .
Example . Zs : we are not really its way as time that people are always tried to interpreting it in our music .
We are looking , rather , as a team player on the musical presence of the other trust and they can develop .
At the beginning , of course our work to make comparisons with the inevitable yonderboi , since several of us and be recorded in a different way .
. Hvg Hu : in the charts of mr2 is petöfi 'wings of love ' ' .
Many have discussed in connection with the name of this number zagar .
Was the opening up in a somewhat populäreren style in the direction of a broader public stage-managed aware ?
Example . Zs : we had no plans to write a bestseller , which can be used as a motor for album .
In this story is about more .
It was the final leg of the albums thought that with the klang # orgy and the somewhat more difficult issues to resolve .
. Hvg Hu : as you have chosen the six sängerinnen ?
Why are you , what was the guiding principle ?
Example . Zs : the basic idea was to make a gospel-artigen chorus .

Banks crisis want
The American Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom , Switzerland and Canada have decided jointly against the crisis on the financial markets .
So more than 100 billion dollars on the currency markets through auctions .
On these auctions auction banks interest rates , to which you are prepared to lend money to each other .
For example , the American Federal Reserve is sending USD 40 billion at auction , further 24 power for the European and the Swiss Central Bank .
It is following the attacks of 11 September , this is the first time that the central banks of the Member States in such a coordinated action to combat or alleviate the effects of a financial crisis .
'This step is to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy , in other words the increasing lack of free verfügbarem capital , the banks can give written in a report for its customers Bernard baumohl of the consultancy firm economic outlook group .
'The coordinated action of the central banks , the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 % to around 50 % reduction added , ' baumohl in his report .
The banks have not been bedienter loans for 60 billion dollars lost , especially in the United States .
Analysts are awaiting further billion-euro losses .
'the central banks must really have a fear of what still can not respond to this approach , as is determined , `` said the chief economist of ABN AMRO , kieran Davies .
It would appear that the situation really is poor , 'he said .
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans , credit for their customers also rise .
This would reduce the consumption and the American economy in a recession , may cause with effect on economic growth throughout the world .
The central banks have decided , after you have not succeeded in reducing the so-called libor , the London banking interest rate in the distribution of funds between banks will be used .
This means that the banks are constantly were to lend money to each other , and this in spite of the fact that the central banks in the USA , Canada and the United Kingdom during the autumn on several occasions have reduced their interest rates .
'It will have the same effect as a further cut in interest rates , `` said Greg salvaggio Tempus consulting the Agency Reuters .
A few analysts are of the opinion that this step of the central banks of the aufheizung contributes to the crisis , because it is not the fundamental problem , which is the case of the property market in the United States .

Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has another hole someone discovered to fall ; his way out of this will remain the same .
For British scandals , this is not particularly schlüpfrig .
No adels # title seem , sold any politician Paris hotel bills , paid no zehen gelutscht wedlock .
But the discovery that a rich businessman donations for the British Labour Government , on more than 650.000 pounds ( 1.3 million dollars ) on four years under the name of other people , and to conceal the party that has failed to declare the disputed territory is something without Gordon Brown , would be well managed .
Two months ago , as the Prime Minister of the demand for an election , away from dämliche way on the intelligence of the British offensive by he claimed that opinion polls , this decision would have been influenced , there was hope that it will provide a strong , efficient government .
Instead , as vince cable , the increasingly incisive representative chairman of the Liberal Democrats , said , the dreaded brown formerly by Stalin to Mr bean .
The unwise , saving Northern Bank , a fragile regulatory weakness and poor judgement under fire .
Ill thought-out proposals to amend the tax laws against the government business associations .
The tax system of loss of the personal data of 25 million people showed incredible administrative to pick .
A trio of generals in the retirement , an uprising in the House of Lords in protest at cuts of military expenditure , the Ministers of the armed forces , it is claimed that a teilzeitjob .
There is now the wide range of donations of David Abraham ; Mr Watts , Labour 's Secretary-General ( and your former head ) compliance is already resigned .
None of this means that brown waived irrevocable direction .
Governments can , however , be a turning point that you feel it impossible to govern .
Neither politicians may still have confidence people , but they are usually their scepticism , if a new force takes the office .
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister to improve the situation , and it does not even to be too long is this postponement : over the public service will begin to leak ; the cabinet ministers to start plaudern ; the press is looking for bad news , and the government is too defensive and no ambition .
In a way , the position of brown is particularly difficult , because in contrast to other political leaders can not say that a new besen .
He is so keen to Tony Blair would be denied , he was upper lieutenant .
The problems with northern rock and the tax documents of competence , for example , hang together with decisions of the brown , as Chancellor of the Finance Ministry .
And even if this was not directly involved in Blair 's mishaps , as in the case of long 'money for adels # title ' -untersuchung of political party funding may be - the electorate that he was .
Nevertheless , brown 'situation is not as bad as it seems
The failings are not so terrible , as you describe the Conservatives .
Like Mr bean , no one is entirely beschwindelt or has died .
And the antidote , painful as it may be , is , of course , seeking brown Stalinist tendencies are promised : a reliable , solid and easily brutal government .
The new political gesture donation is a good example .
The garboeske Abraham , of its donations compared with its non-profit-making gave , he says , do not want any public recognition for its goodwill .
That may be so , but the decision was not to him .
The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear and they are from a clear reason : the public has a right to know who is able to buy access to those who govern the country .
Watts , who says he would know from Abraham agreement , but that it is illegal , will naturally need to ask some questions ; just as jon , mendlesohn Labour 's hauptfinanzeintreiber , about the bizarre donations in October have been told .
But so far not involved is brown : there is nothing that evidence that he knew of this confusion , although most of the payments for his appointment in June .
To date , the Prime Minister , half of the job .
He has quickly the violation of the law by his party , but he condemned watered-down this determination by seizing a well-known instrument , a committee of inquiry on this issue - , to complete the picture of a bishop of the retirement and a judge .
In this case , the 'lessons ' is not very complicated .
If the law has been broken , it is a matter for the police .
Apart from that , there are other things to which Mr Brown , as something of a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life , of the last six months is unfilled , and move forward with a drastic reform of political party funding .
It would require the hard-liners of labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and the special financial relationship with the unions bitter pills , for a party members , such as Mr Brown .
But it should be aware of some partisan facts .
The Conservatives have a clear lead in the opinion polls in two years ; he has voters ; and the only way in which he has achieved is a victory by indisputable probity and solid competence .

The United Kingdom , in the face of decision on the statements by owais Shah and ravi bopara
Each of these two dilemmas , almost as difficult as the others .
Who is supposed to be no 6 for England in kandy this weekend , propose owais Shah or ravi bopara ?
And , not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka , who is to make the decision ?
The second question is important because David graveney , chairman of the elections on call , at least in this particular title , this is the chief coach Peter Michael Vaughan - showing the captain and moores to help and to decide on the table , because of the high morries , the English executive director , beginning with applications for national electoral offices , or even to fill in part-time work .
Whoever gets the sixth thugs position , will be particularly unfortunate , but life is often unfair and it is undoubtedly the sport .
It is never easy to apply a person , what exactly is the tip of his professional activity , whereas someone else to achieve never on the lowest status , hinauskommt sometimes luck instead of a lack of capacity .
It is not only in the cricket , where the choice is difficult , where decisions are needed , which are at the end of subjective .
It is the right time for bopara levels ?
Is it fair to Shah if he is doing this ?
The same may also be asked in a further area if , for example , John edwards tubby 'or ' , banerjee both intelligent young executives with good qualifications , which are well acquainted with the business , should be promoted .
Who can say what the right class for a cricketers , unless he will have the opportunity to go to or swim .
Of course , pay a great influence on decisions , but we also have opportunities .
Within a team , a cricketers , the eye of the captain at the right time to start a wicket can and must take a bat regular opportunities on the regulation , when he , as a eintägiger cricketers impression .
The eyes of the auswähler to catch is more complicated .
There were a lot in the last season , better than , for example , as James Anderson , were to play in the first test , even if Stephen harmison itself for healthy and declared as the wind in the networks kegelt .
Anderson , 32 first-class wickets with the 33 , runs a position in this tour .
Mr tremlett only 29 , with the same modest average , but they had their own high points and hope for even more .
Whether or bopara Shah plays in the asgiriya stage , can only be a way of looking at issue .
The election could decide the careers of both men , or perhaps it makes little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka played batty Gareth in each test and has been successful in the first , with five wickets and 40 useful runs , it was , in fact , Paul collingwood at the time to consolidate kämpfend , of the breakthrough on an important test cricketers , even though he has used and of a double hundred against Australia in Australia , punktete perhaps still being underestimated .
It is probable that , graveney Vaughan - showing and moores , after a further discussion in the context of the current network meeting at the stage asgiriya its Conservative instincts and heavy feeling for shahs greater experience on young people boparas enthusiasm will follow .
There are arguments for both .
For its funkelnden Shah speaks and valuable 88 test-debüt-innings in Mumbai , 43 first-class hundreds and only six of bopara , with 22 years of age , and seven years is an excellent record against angedrehtes bullets .
But only ten runs Shah made in his two innings in the West Indies against may on the test in Lord , its own arena as a player from middlesex , and this , plus the immediate rejection of the auswählern Vaughan - showing healthy , as was his position for the next game , seems to withdraw from the impetus to its proposal , which was obviously in Mumbai .
In contrast , the alleskönner Essex schaufel # way of life .
It is of no place in a British impressed by his attitude and out of this has to come to the point , as he recently with a vehicle in vierradantrieb an exhibition of England sponsor Volkswagen succession .
He has suffered minor injuries and probably a shock , but the first thing he did was , of course , also be gesponsort ) ( Vodafone and his team was Mr Alastair Cook of justice , of this from afar , observed with enthusiasm and say : `` Have you taken ? ' .
Bopara is a much better field , it will be kegelt central rate here with some effect on the playing fields , as he seems to fit and proposes with confidence and skill .
The right man is one thing , to choose the right moment to choose a different .
Perhaps that is the real art of choice .
I tend now bopara its chance , which does not mean that Shah not perhaps be doing well , if , as the teesatz from Ceylon suggests that it was he who will play in this weekend .

Test Peugeot 207 sw 1 ( 6 ) vti voruteile disappear .
To tell the truth , I was never a particular fan of the Peugeot 206 .
His driving properties were not much , the quality of , the control and also the processing could be described as more below average .
But it is now its successor , the Peugeot 207 , on the market , and the situation is much better .
The kombi with the name of sw has moved on a bit , and it only remains for me to change my mind .
The traditional hatchback of 207 tested , I had to , for example , about the lack of a freedom on the back seat .
These complaints are there , because the dimensions of the kombi is designed in such a way that not even zweimetermänner suffering .
Soon further
The internal resources I start by briefly , in order not to repeat myself .
It is a very successful design , where I only because of the poor central tunnel reservations .
I would like a little more designe # criminal organisation , where the car is otherwise a very elegant impression .
The seat is convenient , and the time is over , where we may well be short of beschwerten seats and head restraints .
Also , of course , the back towards the 206 has improved substantially .
As for the space , can also be compounded here if the size of the market .
In the kombi too has already been mentioned , is the lack of their freedom .
In the boot suitcase
The main thing is that car but the loading area .
The , I must aufklappbaren ( the window backwards as well and beladbar platzsparend .
The areas are a restraint belts , equipped with a perfect compromise .
They affect not , auseinanderziehen and are also more severe objects .
However , we are talking about the loading volume .
It is under the table in the basic structure of 428 litres in comparison with the competition is a rather average value .
Not , however , in relation to the car sold in the Czech Republic offer this class , the fabia Skoda combi .
If we take the 207 sw with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav , we find that the Peugeot at hefty 52 litres .
For a holiday abroad or in a child car invite this value is already critical .
However , I must stress the positiva nor the after the umklappen of very shallow loading area or the very low loading kante .
120 PS in four ranks
Our test vehicles with a vierzylinder- was 1.6 litres with benzinmotor 's cylinder capacity and an output of 88 KW .
And , quite frankly , there should be a 1 600 kubik- engine , propels familien-hatchback .
It is quiet , has a low consumption and a good way forward .
If I compare Skoda with his counterpart in the works , as would sometimes be with a auspuff lappen blocked , then I can only be impressed by it .
The price list speaks volumes
The price of the car is not just volkstümlich .
Nevertheless , we must remember that we have a well-funded car with a geräumigen innneren and a very good engine have tested .
The basic price of vehicles with the 1400er in petrol engines of SEK 329900 is still on .
With our engine costs from 410900 Crowns which is quite a lot .
The allocation of the premium is proposing test car again with an extra SEK 80000 effect .
However , we have had difficulty airbags , automatic air-conditioning , automatic scheiben # wische # raus # solution , electricity and the fensterheber and ...
It is costing a total of SEK 531900 car pure and simple .
That is a lot , but do you anticipate the supplementary budget of a fabia together and they will arrive in a very similar amount .
Therefore the decision , it only remains to be chosen which brand .

Continental days are not widely holidays
In Hungary are holidays carefully regulated by law , so that the practice of the umdisponierens working days around the holidays , however , has now been established , robbing us less such next year .
In the EU and in America , it goes without saying , 'holiday ' .
The Hungarian legal distinction between public holidays and working free days .
Labour free days are mostly church holidays , or are in connection with major historic events .
For example , we are celebrating neujahr : both the last day of the old , and the first day of the new year , working free days alone - the latter for the silvester-feiernden can rest .
Throughout the year , we have a total of fourteen holidays .
The public feiertage , on 15 March , the revolution of 1848 and reminded of 23 October , the day of the revolution of 1956 .
On 20 August , the political establishment , on 1 May , the work on 1 and 2 November we remember our deaths .
In addition , there are two holidays , pfingsten at Easter and Christmas .
As our Heads of State , nationhood or religious holidays rarely come to a weekend , the practice of 'arbeitstags- postponement ' in the cases where we stood before or after the day would only work for one day .
The price of the extended weekend , however , is that we , on the samstagen to work very well , or in the school must go .
When this day , before or after , at the end of the day , will be worked for many years by the Labour Minister in a regulation .
The legislation applies to all employers and -nehmer , for public officials and officials of the public service as well .
Are only exempted companies and institutions , in which the operation without interruption , and therefore also of the public holidays .
Today , the organisation of work only by the end of the year , slightly confused with effect from 24 December , the life formally here at home , as most of the days between Christmas and New Year 's Eve , or the economic balance of time to leave suspended .
In the next year more holidays in the weekly centre , or at the end of the week , so that the working days will be less umdisponierungen than this year .
First the calendar around the day of the work 'upside down ' , so that the people of the same four days in a row can stay at home .
Saturday , 26 April will be a working day , so that the Friday , 2 may be a day of rest .
The second umdisponierung is linked to the day , on 23 October , on Saturday , 18 October on the Friday , we will have to deal with 24 October in advance .
The end of the year will , however , completely in the name of public holidays are from 24 December , after all , to stand still , even if New Year 's Eve falls on a Wednesday .

By budget
Yes , it is .
The public budget is adopted .
What is particularly on this budget ?
It is the first budget that this government has drafted , and without the support of opposition by the coalition majority was adopted .
The for the current year , with the support of the cssd ( social democrats ) , because it sobotka ( of this party Minister ) , and the cssd therefore could not afford to reject it .
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government nothing drastic happened this time .
The Congress of Deputies approved this traditional little attended , nevertheless very important act calmly .
This is somewhat paradoxical .
Everything governance begins and ends with the various chapters of the budget and , whether we like it or not .
The budget is an integral part of the policy , but by means of full power struggle of the government and the opposition .
This is a dankbareres subject for the media , and that is why they devote more attention .
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public as a sober figures .
The public budgets have suffered in the last social democratic governments under three weaknesses , the budget for the year 2008 can eliminate not at once .
The first is the high percentage of expenditure , which is binding in law , because it is not only the pensions , but also social expenditure , the 'tacit ' coalition of cssd and kscm ( Communists ) in the last year before the elections .
The second is the deficit of budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point .
The third restriction is the deficits of the public finances , in other words the budgetary deficits of the Communities .
The main risk is , however , not the state budget deficit .
This budget is public and eingermaßen under control .
A veritable time bomb is the budgetary deficit of the Communities .
Many mayors , gave no revenue from tax , levies and other sources for investment bank loans , often for consideration by the bonds of their halls in the excessive indebted .
In recent years , this debt managed by massive selling shares and other supplies of energy networks in the train of privatisation of the State , a result had received .
This source is now already be extinguished .
As far as we are only of official and verifiable facts , we find that :
Our economy has , for a number of years , as the rest of the world , which is currently going through a period of growth , the cssd boasts about constantly .
This was a unique opportunity for their governments , public finances in order .
Instead , the governments of the state debt , however , still more .
Other countries , apart from a few exceptions , such as Hungary , Pakistan , Albania or Egypt , have spent much more sensible than our Republic .
That is a great shame , mainly the previous governments .
We are among the countries that , on a global scale , seen the threat of poverty .
That is why no nassiven social programmes , which are , unfortunately , just in the last few years in überflüssigerweise aufgeblasen huge scale .
Even if it is a part of the senseless populist expenditure , which this year before the elections have been adopted , it is clear that if it is not in the near future , to an increase in the retirement age and a pension reform , practically ends in any policy in this country , and , regardless of who is in power , he will not remain a purely manage .
It is only too easy to say that current politicians from the officers , the bulk of the tax revenue mechanical on pensions and social expenditure .
Therefore , this year 's budget no revolution , but can only be normal expenditure by the displacement of compulsory expenditure .
In 2008 , the deficit of 70 billion kronor would be entirely superfluous if previous governments in the last ten years , which not only have been spent .
If we do not want that it really is that ruling politicians purely administrative officials , we must be patient and that is not too strong coalition government which , however , is aware that the state can not spend just as much as it to take on taxes and charges of calm in the preparation for further reform laws .
This can only be a gradual implementation of a balanced budget .

'Sorry , I have you forgotten that somebody from the marketing department called ' - says a colleague .
It has failed to provide a meeting ?
At best , it regrets and is trying to repair , perhaps in the marketing department and recognises reumütig possessed , one might have forgotten to host the news ( this is the less normal method ) .
The matter is usually with an excuse .
Before being involved in embarrassing excuses , you should consider his colleagues , really tough times can cause and to try to prevent these situations from aware .
Something which is not borrowed a even heard ?
There is very little , nervigeres than opting for a document office software , or does the telephone , but it is not there .
It was a major yesterday is still on the desk - it is way this morning ?
Or will the lost pen geglaubte around on the desk discovered a colleague ?
It is not without questions from Members , because they are angry , and rightly , if you find that something is weggekommen .
So , no kuverts or post-its from the office in the pocket , because it could set a themselves , because if we refuse 's desperately needs .
Getratsche on the private lives of the gentlemen ?
There is no effective means of a tratsch already established in the world .
Anyone who , with whom ?
Where and why ?
It should be the information ( or assumptions ) on the private lives of colleagues for every opportunity to tie the nose .
However , if someone to open up and innerstes secret gives us , we should not take advantage of this trust .
It is the best as a grave , rather than just not here , even if other on the problems of colleagues know .
Without reason ill informed ?
If the office is possessed by nagging headaches ill , because we feel very uneasy , or merely to rest , we should be clear about one thing : the work urgent settlement , projects with firm dates must now rather than a matter of the Members .
The Members due not evil .
When you have the previous day , we know that the next day in the Bureau will not create , or that something could dazwischenkommen , and therefore we must remain at home , we should declare it in good time , so that neither the gentlemen , yet the head unexpectedly with the absence .
Gekicher , telephone , gesumme
It is precisely in its work , but will be strengthened by the gekicher suddenly be disrupted by the Members ?
Without wanting to a telephone conversation mitgehört , it would have been better not to hear ?
We should not be singing with sums , talks ( the people on their heads , getrampel leads ) , dauerndem ski struggles or stop complaining about such issues nerves .
All this can be very disturbing , even if they do not just in a task ( letter , planning , muster ) are strengthened .
The other is to blame ?
A project is not ready on time , it has been an important letter or important nachrichte forget , abzuschicken should be the fault of the own vergesslichkeit not in other ways .
It is not possible to the chaos in the Bureau or the read Mr excuses !
They are best its mistake and an apology , if others were concerned .
The question of how to make the mistake again , or it can do so , is very appropriate .
In the office - a sense as at home ?
Training trousers and schlapfen : convenient for at home , but has not lost in the office .
Not even should then be dress as bombers , if the workplace would actually allow !

The researchers could recognise that the brain activities were always very moderate if both participants with your answer and therefore also have the same content , but if one of you twice , has led to a greater `` brain activity .
I am not quite sure whether it will actually require as much scientific effort to achieve this outcome .

Everything is open
Mitt romey said that he is not worthy of a presidential candidate , of a white man to be consulted .
Nevertheless , the Republican candidate for the Presidency , in the end of a debate on youtube in the ordinary voters on video issues and to submit them to send the candidates .
None of the questions on Wednesday evening , 28 November , were raised as ridiculous as the white man , Democrats on the global warming in the debate youtube speak of the other party .
But the issues , and the answers , this time spiegelten exactly the state of the republican party in the elections next year .
It is not known as the producers of CNN , the debate , mitunterstützten the potential candidates youtube zeigenden clips auswählten .
However , in the first half hour of debate , the longest the individual issue has been devoted to the issue of immigration in the heart .
The issue is one of the most potent issues for Republicans .
The CNN asked a group of hybrid electorate a flat wähl # to operate , if you have heard that they liked things : the television station said intensity of the agreement as the candidates strictly on the borders of languages .
The strictest and longest exchange between rudy Giuliani was the evening , the national leaders , and romney in the crucial polls in iowa and new Hampshire forward was .
The image of companies ' shackles tried Giuliani , he is flexible with regard to illegal immigration , when he was mayor of New York .
It romney attacked the former governor of Massachusetts accused of a crime , illegal immigrants for work on his house to cease .
The two , particularly formidable apart as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates ' Amnesty ' ( the illegal a regular status and the opportunity to the citizenship ) would support would be .
Relatively unimportant candidates as Duncan hunter , a kalifornischer members of Congress and Tom tancredo congressmen , a Member of Parliament from Colorado , has been able to press on this subject .
Neither of the two men has serious opportunities in the nomination , but both remain in the race , perhaps because they earlier and more than other on the immigration pauke gehauen .
At least in the area of immigration in the candidate countries share the same views : tougher limits , intolerance towards illegal migrants .
This issue , together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world , the republicans help the differences between liberal and Christian Conservative to forget or to emigrate .
However , the debate has been clearly problematic than other issues were raised .
Mr Giuliani was asked why he arms restrictions have supported in the past .
John MacKein and romney debating whether simuliertes drowning should be regarded as torture .
One of the questioner asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible .
This meant that the Giuliani arguing that although the Bible privileged paper , it should be the history of jonah and perhaps not quite literally , think of Europe .
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
Now huckabee Mike - contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary .
As he has been pressed , whether they are in favour of Jesus , he said lachte and intelligent Jesus was in order to apply a political office .
The race is exceptionally wide open .
Huckabees rise in iowa , together with Ron pauls recent spendener # consequences and his beifalls # storms in the debate by Wednesday .
These two are hochgeschossen from nothing , because the two wing of the Party not to one of the better known and more traditional candidates .
In the year 2000 , and a candidate from the outset , the party and convincingly , together with winning a message on the size of the USA and a zwinkern on both arms of the party .
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear .

Climate propaganda
As the debate on climate change both the sceptics of climate change , as well as those who are in the social and political debate , on the basis of a brutal criticism , must make the whole movement as a strong cohesion .
Especially if it is a leader of the movement that , as in the case of the intergovernmental President Zapatero , the fight against climate change is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even ,  proposes a new contract with the planet to conclude `` .
This proposal , however , will make him in erklärungsnot concerning the action or lack of action on the part of his government , which has played a decisive role in Spain , that within the EU at the top of the list of the countries to which the provisions of the Protocol kioto- least .
Who is responsible for the failure to comply with the requirements of the sectors , and this is due to its government , which is why the  Treaty with the planet `` proposed that this development can not be stopped .
It is also now , forced the Spanish citizens provided for the measures to combat climate change outright .
What businesses will be affected by this behaviour on the part of the citizens , which is to be changed , the individual and collective austerity measures need to be carried out and the economic consequences .
To be more specific , those who are victims , and to save the planet will pay .
However , there are and there will be no such declarations in the future .
It is precisely because it is the aufopfern and pay for it .
Because the measures against climate change in real terms are unpopular can be used .
They are free , and inconvenient for much of the accounts of companies and citizens .
Even the proposed by the Spanish benzin-cent Zapatero election in strategic terms , so dangerous that he had to withdraw the proposal .
Accordingly , it is now the planet with nothing , in other words with pure propaganda and empty chapter to save without any real consequences .
With impressive statements , committees and committees , protocols and new posts .
With its agreements with the planet , the otherwise so appropriate politicians for electoral campaigns , or not yet , however , instead of the challenging expenditure , to add the meeting and with its sanftmut and goodness other .
But this will only happen if the agreement differs from its purely virtual nature and therefore also claims that the bicycle is not the only means of transport in the future , or we will only with a range erfrischen .

New fears on gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
Nevertheless , a new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia , which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe .
The largest part of the Russian gas exports to the European Union ( EU ) will be guided by the Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations will be very closely monitored .
Kiev has warned that if Moscow the price we pay for the natural gas , increased by Russia in higher transit charges .
A former conflict between the two states in the last year in the EU Member States reduced supplies .
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow has happened at a time of the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State gasmonopol Gazprom is trying to reach an agreement on how much the Ukraine on Russian gas in the year 2008 must pay .
According to the Gazprom more to Ukraine must be calculated , because it has agreed to 50 % for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan .
Analysts , it would mean that the Ukraine 40 % more for the import of Gazprom must pay .
It is important for us to make our arguments as one of the most important gastransitstaaten to use in talks , `` said the economic ministers of the Ukraine Anatoly the kinakh Reuters news agency .
'The changing gas prices should certainly with our arguments about the level of transit charges [ to ] on Ukraine Western Europe . '
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev alerted in January 2006 Gazprom supply to Ukraine .
This led to a case in consequence of exports to Western Europe , as far as the prices in the stridently emphasised .
Russian gas is a quarter of the supply of the European Union .
Russia has the world 's largest gas , but much of it is still underdeveloped .
The consequence is that Gazprom is its own resources with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations .

What security is best for me ?
The found by the drivers , which is one of the possible claim , which implies a high cost , the level of wiederrum depends on various factors , including their age , sex , the drafting of the driving licence , family , type of cars insured and use , and so on .
To have a car is only the beginning .
It is even more difficult to find the right to be found as the right vehicle model .
First of all , a clear , what we are dealing with .
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholders .
This agreement is written by an insurance Treaty , which lays down that the society and the abgesprochene insurance premium is obliged in return for a disaster to submit the appropriate compensation sum .
The insurance premium is the cost of insurance , which is made up of a number of factors , including the age , sex , time of the preparation of the driving licence , family , type of vehicle insured or use .
The insurance companies are the statistics in accordance with their prices , and so to a higher risk of accidents due higher contributions .
For this reason , both on 25-jährige and women less contributions , for statistics show that these groups thanks to your prudence in a lower level of accidents .
The same goes for married people , since this according to the statistical values and therefore also the conviction , to fewer accidents as a tendency to go it alone .
The benefits which will affect the vehicle , the frequency of the fahrens and therefore the probability of an accident .
The more often the use of the damage , the more likely .
In the preparation of the insurance premium must take account of a number of points .
For this reason , we must carefully study the situation of drivers , precisely in order to select the car insurance , the most personal needs .
At this point we lists are the most important points which we in the selection of a security should take into account , not just a service , but also a price on election .
Under 25 year-old meeting on the choice of cheap insurance to many obstacles , such as , for example , the low level of driving and  young `` licence .
Even if it is an ideal insurance protection would be the best way to conclude a vollkaskoversicherung , there are cheaper alternatives .
The cautious drivers can choose to vollkasko of participation , so that the benefits of a vollkaskoversicherung is covered , but at a low price .
This type of treaty means that the customer is a part of the damage caused by the amount must pay for themselves .
The `` amount will be a conclusion of the Treaty and the level of insurance premium and this is set to bezahlende higher , the smaller the amount , `` Luis Noguera , Spain , the main representative at first Europe , a conciliation for online insurance companies .
Another option is the enlarged security , the customers insured against external accident damage , but not against the damage caused to the own car .
Furthermore , this type of insurance theft , fire and vehicle loss .
There is a Council .
If you are under 25 years old , it is in your hands , to reduce the costs of insurance ; this is your credit by versuchst careful to avoid driving and accidents .
A credit is a reduction of the basic tariff in the relevant insurance company .
On the contrary , a criminal payment raising tariff in question .
The level `` credits and criminal payments conditional on the society and their income .
If the company a yield year behind it , it can allow itself to increase the payments bonus- Noguera , `` explained .
As soon as the 25-jahre-marke is exceeded , for the sake of the drivers , it is easy to conclude an agreement , and the reason for this is the fact that as a result of the accident rate driving .
It is therefore best to campaign for a vollkaskoversicherung with voluntary participation .
`` can normally do not benefit from the young people of their previous experience , both in the case of an accident and at the time of the fahrens `` , not the Spanish vorsteher of the European company , and adds that the majority of the accidents in the second place , operational year after the  fear of the anfängers himself `` .
It is nevertheless a married customers , no children , that is , of course , to conclude a vollkaskoversicherung ; only if the financial situation of the appropriate person also allows .
From the insurers are married couples with children as customers , with the lowest rate of accidents , and correspondingly low also fall within their contributions .
In this case , with a vollkaskoversicherung ( for a sum of about EUR 300 ) the best option in the event that it has received a great credit , is an enlarged Security , only the third year of vehicle .
You are `` as a whole and entspannter have a greater purchasing power , which allows them to pay a higher contributions , Luis Noguera , `` schedule .
It provides for pensioners , with a vollkaskoversicherung ( for a sum of about EUR 150 ) , or an enlarged security , the only conclude with a sufficiently high credit .
Finally , it must be said that the car insurance is something very important , not only because they are the driver protects against possible accident damage , but also because of the high costs that it will require a thorough choice is made , in line with our own situation .

Buses are refugees back to work and in order to combat Al-Qaeda .
The first busladungen Iraqi refugees from Syria , yesterday in Baghdad , with a stream of displaced persons whose money is imperative or visas , and others who hoped that the city to normality .
Some were even come back to combat the rebels , which they have been driven from their homes .
At the busbahnhof mansour before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses , was the terminal betriebsam with refugees from Syria and Jordan , which were returned in private transport .
'I decided to go to Syria , after many doctors were killed in Baghdad , `` said ' Sabah 'has a al-qubaisi sunnitischer doctor .
'I came back today , because what I have seen on television and what I have read in the newspapers about what has happened in Baghdad and , as it is now safe . '
You say that the mahdi- army left off to kill , 'he said , in relation to the Shia Muslim militia of militant klerikers moqtada al-sadr has ordered , of its forces back at the present time .
Qassim Al atwani , a 38-jähriger schiitischer teachers from the vast Sunni part of amariyah , returned with his two children , because it syrisches visa could not be renewed and because the regime Iraqis not permitted to work .
His Shiite neighbours in amariyah called on him to say that a local , supported by the United States has contributed militia Al Qaeda from their bastion in the West to drive the capital , and urge him to return .
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni , Shia , stammes from his home in sleikh Baghdad in the north by an attack with grenades , after they have been driven out of his fellow citizens had invited to combat al-qaidas .
He was , in order to fight back .
'two days ago I saw some of my friends and tell me that they sleikh began in the anti-al-qaida-miliz and that you have my support and that of my young need .
That is why I returned today ' , said sabaah alu , obeidi 62 .
Many told that , through the increasing calm in the capital , since the us-truppenerhöhung and the growth of local people are lured 'citizens ' groups , which were armed and in cooperation with the American military defend their parts .
However , more languages by home visa problems and dwindling funds to be forced in Damascus , where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years .
A 51-jähriger Dar-es-Salam , al-samarrai dreimal # of father , expressed its general suspicion among the exiles that nouri al-Maliki , of the Shiite Prime Minister , the Syrian Government had asked for the refugees , visa restrictions , in order to force people to return .
More than two and a half million people are perhaps of the sectarian squads have fled the country .
'We did well to al-Maliki Syria and visited the Iraqis urged the government not to visas to return to force in Iraq , `` the Sunni pensioners .
'I do not have a government that criminal , supported by my house , having burned down way . '
Part of the reason for the decline of the violence is that Sunni from Shiite residential areas and the other way round , which led to the creation of many places where tensions .
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will stir up again sectarian tensions and conflicts .

The founding fathers of the Rock in order to kraut #
Germany super Group of the 1970s musiziert : the three band by Members of harmonia their konsolen once again in a concert in Berlin .
The distinct revival seems a mitschnitt its great time 'live ' in 1974 .
At that time , they were much famous abroad .
The directive strikes sensational news in the shape of three gesetzter gentlemen in the evening blackboard .
Everyone has his boxes , on its cable and , above all , its knöpfe .
Moebius claim Dieter in our white shirt with 63 years in the middle .
The Left accompanied by Michael rother , 57 years young and the possession of laptop and gitarre .
Law , of the audience , is krümmt hans-joachim roedelius , 73 , hard on the konsole .
Everyone has sound , sometimes even a beat .
And sometimes it is allowed to a traditional piece of music .
That seems to be the gentlemen even not great disturbance .
The bond harmonia again , musiziert under krautrock-liebhabern for some attention .
And here we must reveal : specific enquiries have indicated that , in the name of the collective popgedächtnis schwirrte , but in no way , in a sustainable way this band for 32 years to miss painful .
But why should not also German its basic living from the seventies should celebrate ?
Because what is misleading kraut # rock in England and America was always more than in their own country .
As the music industry the survivors of the Cologne group can 2003 ECHO 's price for the work , as was seen in the Chamber in fragende German popgesichter .
As the red hot chili peppers in a hymn of praise , even in the bands la Düsseldorf , a new , bedankten knew the surprise no borders .
In performing Michael hockte rother later on in the red hot chili peppers on the stage as an old mate .
The problem of the ignorance at home and in the foreign verklärung .
The memory is therefore beyond harmonia because the trio only two years of its existence and , at this time , a far less power than they subsequently effectively pursued by other .
Moebius and roedelius with the artists had previously schnitzler Conrad under the promising name cluster musiziert .
Firstly , in the basement played in the Berlin show stage .
Then in Düsseldorf , for economic reasons for a of the Church unterhaltenes housing label .
Rother had been helpful in providing a moment on power station and then , as gitarrist in new , then perhaps the most radical German group , a call erspielt .
In order to rother in 1973 , followed by the cluster- players in forst in exile in the weserbergland .
There , in the old weserhof , a heap from the sixteenth century as urban volatile kommunarden lived .
Less ideological than in the municipality I , where there are still roedelius as nannies plagues .
In spitzweghaftem existence of artists .
It was also a waste in the non-proliferation of wimpel gesangs # associations and ottenstein harmonia a name for art .
Some of them harmonia considered .
The first was album 'music of harmonia ' and the 'de luxe ' .
Because the music and sounded too modest , the volume of material distress suffered .
It was reisigsammeln not only of making .
The CD appeared in 1974 'live ' was a concert in griessem mitgeschnitten before an almost 50-köpfigen record façade , as someone believes recall .
At the time of rother was the wish to introduce harmonia and occasionally .
For roedelius and a moebius unsittliche demand .
The bond stated their separation in 1975 .
Rother went in the esoterisch-sphärischen and assured its existence with alben as ' fierce heart ' .
In the achtzigern clusters and revived since then harmonia successfully than it ever was .
The griessemer is livealbum Herbert grönemeyer .
The Greenland music company has set itself the goal of becoming the kraut # rock , as a fundamental German contribution to the living music .
Recently , it has already roedelius solo work as one .
The physical resurrection of harmonia will take place in the Berlin House of the cultures of the world .
So in public , in the framework of the festival woldtronics .
Julian cope is here , the British , altpunk and draftsman of the handbook kraut # sampler 'coat ' .
There is also the loveparade- Dr motte inventors .
The entire range of the influence of the kraut # rocks on the subsequent popmusik would be defined .
Of harmonia the centre of the super group .
The sentence by Brian eno with the absonderlichsten sounds hanging in the Chamber : 'the only real music , it is the future . '
There are the producers , with harmonia were in the rural world .
The education legend # serve other projections black-and-white photographs of wirr verkabelten equipment .

Not by the microphones orgel and on the key issue , in order to put the instruments for themselves an effective gebastelte equipment to coax tone .
Today , the electronic music as electronic music .

Rock kraut # has always been a very English concept .
It was never rock .
The roots , less in the blues music , sought than universities ( can ) , technologies ( power station ) or on the run from artistic and social conventions ( cluster ) .

The hellish Venus is the world zwilling
Venus , despite their life is hostile atmosphere of the world than has so far been similar thought : the European spacecraft Venus express ' , 'lightning in the atmosphere and wind upset in Poland , as also in the winter in the world .
For almost three decades scientists indicate that Venus blitzt .
Now , the European sonde 'Venus express ' the evidence - they sensed electromagnetic waves in the margins of the atmosphere : the lightning on Venus shooting of a level of around 56 kilometres of cloud to cloud , Christopher Russell reported by the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal .
According to the famous ' ursuppen- theory 'lightning life on earth : to create storm in the ocean reactions , have suggested to the education of amino acids , the building blocks of life .
Not so on Venus : 'If ever there were living in them , it must have been very early history , declared by the Solomon Sean Carnegie institution in Washington .
Today , on the surface of the Venus barely alive : the atmosphere is nearly a hundred times as the poet , there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degree .
'The Venus is perhaps the vicious zwilling throughout the world , but it is a zwilling ' Russell said .
Why the Venus , the earth in mass and size is just such a completely different development has taken , is the fundamental question of the esa-mission .
The start of 'Venus express ' in November 2005 was a milestone for the venus- research , because since the beginning of the 1990s , no more sonde for research into this planet .
The latest research results , which is now in a number of 'nature ' , presented -artikeln underline the researchers believe that not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system .
They show that the characteristics of our neighbouring planet with the earth are greater than was first thought , shares the ESA .
So , the researchers in addition to the already well-known vertebrate wind in the North Pole a cloud concession to the südpol , which is still very much .
The phenomenon of air flows at the irdischen winter hemisphere , writes a research team by Giuseppe piccioni of the Italian Istituto Di astrofisica spaziale e fisica cosmica .
The second central planet of the solar system is almost the same as the earth and is 12.100 kilometres in diameter almost exactly the same size .
The as morgen- or evening star described in less than 225 days planet under the sun .
It is much more slowly but with themselves : a venustag takes 243 earthly days .
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar in the earth , hardly researchers claim that both planet under very similar conditions have been created .
On both there has been the water , on the ground , was on the oceans of Venus but in the space was lost .
And while carbon dioxide on the ground , karbonatgesteinen it makes on Venus most of the atmosphere .

This is not warhols boxes
Who the concepts of Sweden and wood trunk unites , think of Ikea , but not in Andy warhol .
Or is it ?
At the moment , in Sweden fabrizierte wood cases of dark shadow over warhols list of materials .
A large part of the vierundneunzig there brillo- boxing listed by the 'type Stockholm ' are counterfeiting .
After the Swedish newspaper a few months ' expressen doubts about the authenticity of Andy warhols brillo- boxing of 1968 , stirred up internal investigations in the moderna museet in Stockholm , now a sobering results : the six 'brillo- boxes ' , the director of the former museums # pontus Hulthén 's speech the moderna 1995 museet Constantine , vermacht are - and perhaps also copies of the large proportion of around one hundred further brillo- boxing of the 'type of Stockholm ' on the international art market are in circulation .
The background is a verschachtelt confusing circle of artistic and kuratorischer productions .
Warhol 1964 introduced in New York , his first 'brillo- boxes `` bemalte wood boxes on the rot-blau-weißen design of cardboard boxes of the seifenpulvers ' brillo ' .
An exhibition of its work in the moderna 1968 was museet - with warhols agreement - hundreds of brillo- of cardboard boxes : these were ( from cost reasons ) , but warhol were not delivered directly from the brillo-kartonagenfabrik .
It is not art works , but their role models , mere exhibits .
At the same time , warhol 1968 has probably given permission to produce a few brillo-holzkisten in Sweden , but not in the moderna issued museet .
Zeitzeugen are now talking of about 15 cases at the time , the original andy- authorised warhol- brillo- boxes with the term 'type of Stockholm ' is correct in the arts and auction history .
Some of them have at auction reached more than 100 000 dollars .
The problem is that the legendary director museums # Hulthén 's speech pontus falsely claimed later , there are around one hundred cases of wood in 1968 and produced in Sweden has been issued , the warhol then have left to him .
Indeed , hulténs 105 everything in Malmö until 1990 , for an exhibition in St Petersburg .
At this stage warhol three years was already dead .
I heard , byström chefkonservator at the moderna museet , in addition to the six museums # own brillo- boxes three from the Swedish private possession , two of which were drawn up in Stockholm in 1968 : its pressing span # records were first and grundiert , abgeschmirgelt was then with a White ölfarbe task pinsel .
The structure of the copies from 1990 , however , reveals that the colour with a painter role without grundierung directly to the pressing span # had been also want - it is not oil , but acrylfarbe .
'these cases have not been authorised by the artists and if the official list of Andy warhols brillo- boxes ' can be removed , the director of the moderna , museet Lars , nittve stated : 'If the ' Andy warhol type authentication board 'in New York , not to a different conclusion , the moderna the museet six boxes in its collection as copying / display classify ' material .
Back in July , the authentication board has announced that the serious accusations ' , which , in terms of the seifenpulver- boxes .
However , since we are in unerbittliches there remains silent .

Political capital Hungarian guard of increased risk .
In the view of the department for risk analysis section ) ( risk analysing the activities of political capital in this August , with the support of the movement for a better Hungary 'formed Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects .
In the report risikowarnungs- 'of the Institute stated amongst other things : in the context of the activities of the Hungarian guard , the highest political risk the tightening up of the existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and nicht-zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary , even in the short term , lead to violent ethnic conflicts ' .
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard , probably at the provocation of such a debate , so that research institute .
As has already been mentioned , this will be a failure on the part of the political leaders : considered 'persons of public life , the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups , who are now left to their political strategy at the Roma ungarn- contrast have built ' .
It is believed that this will exacerbate the problem , the sensible dialogue , foot injuries , and the likelihood of violent clashes would increase .
This means forschungsinsitut ausserdem , the activities of the Hungarian guard , not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media , 'the image of Hungary abroad , especially as substantial damage confidence in the stability and democratic maturity . ' .
Let us remind ourselves that , since the autumn of 2006 , the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary in the recovery and continuously since summer 2007 , 'a number of national defence club founded ' organisations have been singled out .
These groups ' common characteristic of each define as a civil organisation , while you open to claim that its Members - sometimes armed - defence tasks ( for civil protection , national defence , ordnungshütung ) , in the name of the ineffectiveness of the police , the army , or the State itself ' , it said .
Furthermore , all of this is in accordance with the method , the attempt to the various different political and party apathy of the population , based on political aspirations to camouflage as civil initiative .
The emphasis on the civilian nature and the association , not just to the circumvention of legal obstacles in the course of the entry on Court which might arise at the same time , it is a political strategy .
As the analysis is observed , the activities of the Hungarian guard , which is also a risk factor for relations with neighbouring states .
In recent months , the Hungarian guard in several neighbouring States quoted as a potential source of danger , some extreme nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries in the creation of the Hungarian guard against the confirmation of its own policy ungarn- .
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region , it said .
From the point of view of the research institute is the creation of the Hungarian guard is not an isolated phenomenon in zentral-ost-europa , so the political risk for the entire region .
As has already been mentioned , the activities of the Hungarian guard with which the Bulgarian national guard , whose establishment in August 2007 from the extreme right Bulgarian National Union ( bnu ) has been announced .
In the light of the creation of the Bulgarian guard , the roma-massenausschreitungen in some districts of Sofia ( krasna poljana ) .
The bnu , the incidents at the reason for the establishment of the national guard , taken with the argument that the objective of the organisation of the 'national protection ' .
Your opinion , namely in the last 17 years of a 'gypsy terror ' in Bulgaria , felt by the state , and has , however , remained indifferent as political resources .
Furthermore , the initiative should have a heated debate in the Bulgarian public losgetreten .
As I said , the increased risk for ethnic conflict is also shown by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced their own guards to resistance purposes .
Since the activities of the Hungarian guard has many similarities with which the Bulgarian national guard shows , it is likely that the Hungarian Roma also organise , with their own protection at the threats , at the risk warnungs # report by political capital .
Attila , juhász director of research in political capital said to question the intelligence agencies : the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute .
Risk analysis reports would be published annually , and should be clear risk changing trends will inform the public opinion , as in the case of the provision of risk warning report .

Small Saarland , good education
The smallest federal country is in the professional training and a lead , even with the international orientation of its universities .

`` I 'on the 50th time yesterday a nichtsaarländer stated that we are not a French ' - this slogan plakatiert the smallest federal country to its 50th birthday of irony .
In France and Luxembourg , a major role in the education system of the saarlands in the educational monitor the Institute of the German economy Cologne ( iw ) in place five .
So the universities cooperate closely in tradition with the neighbouring countries .
The university in 1948 Saarbrücken was set up by the French people .
Students are able today to their studies with a dual or even three specialist qualification .
The is a correspondingly high proportion of foreign students with 15,6 % .
But the national children also expresses the Saar in greater than average number of universities - many of them without a conclusion on the high school .
'in the Saar uses the vocational education system ' , it says , plünnecke Axel educational expert in the iw .
More than one in five young people buying in its study for a vocational school Saarland , so that it is more than seven points higher than the average .
The combined possibilities of vocational and academic training are comparatively very much .
In terms of the population is the availability of dual courses the second-best in Germany .
Despite the pragmatic training and rising demand , the number of engineering graduates in recent years , however , has fallen by a third .
That is why the Ministry of Education saarländische universities now to a marketing campaign for engineering scientific subjects .
'in the general visual schools , we have the first PISA study launched a number of reforms , ' says the spokesman of the Ministry of Education .
So , the government of a comparative tests .
To enable children to begin to learn in the last kita-jahr charge is a model that other federal countries now copying .
If the services of pupils , will only improve sustainable future comparative studies .
In 2003 , the proportion of schrumpfte PISA risk pupils from 29 % to 20 % .
Overall , the steigerte Saarland , however , not as strong as other federal states .
The Bavarians better count .
And to the chagrin of the saarländer are not measured in fremdsprachenkenntnise PISA - in this area could otherwise be points .
Because the language of the neighbours in secondary schools duty - even if the saarländer no French people .

For a teddy # bears a name , there was now a court in Khartoum .
After indication of its prosecutor , the British teacher in Sudan , because insult of Islam , was charged on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion .
The British six to seven years of pupils , allowed a teddy # bears the name of Mahomet , although any description of the Islamic prophet is banned .
They would have to ausgepeitscht it deserves .
After several times parents of pupils in the Sudanese kultusministerium had been complained to the 54-jährige primary school teacher to the unity of the high school of Khartoum , on Sunday at home and taken up in Article 125 of the Sudanese criminal code to the insult of Islam .
In fact , this matter at the beginning of September , as the teacher by its resumption of a name calling seven-year pupils in the class select Teddy .
Children are the  eight names , including Hassan , Abdullah and Mohammed `` , Robert boules head teachers .
Finally , as the class , 20 by 23 votes for children as favourite first name Mohammed .
Certainly , Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet , but also a very frequent forename in Sudan .
Then the children have a paper on the class , drawn up with the photograph of the bears the signature and my name is `` Mohammed `` .
The bear even bore no shield with this name , but the problem is simply that the presentation of Islamic guides will be regarded as an insult of Islam .
One of the Muslim colleagues from Gillian Gibbons have said , of the same school in Sudan , informed , you well know , and you would never have had done something , as it is a religious faith , to `` I only regret that it has asked for the children , to vote in favour of a name `` , in its view , this is a `` `` innocent mistakes .
An opinion which many pupils of the teacher in these areas , as `` very sensitive to their pupils and `` as `` person never in the class `` describe talking about religion .
It should be noted that the forename Mohammed , at the same time , the most common in the United Kingdom 's second name is accommodated in English , on the other hand there are 14 different ways .
This often Muslim families selected forename is regarded as a sort of homage to the prophet ( it is often the erstgeborenen ) given a family .
But what are the rules in relation to the use of this vornamens ?
We must , for example , be it a toy ?
This is , of course , a matter of interpretation .

At the bus station mansour , before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen penalties , was the active to terminal with refugees from Syria and Jordan , had returned in private .
`` I decided to go to Syria , after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad '' , said Sabah al-qubaisi , a doctor .
`` today , I came back because of what I have seen on television and what I read in the newspaper , about what has happened in Baghdad , and how it would be safe now . ''
They say that the mahdi army stopped killing people `` , he said , regarding the Shiite militias of the militant cleric moqtada al-sadr who ordered his forces to the present time back to place .
Qassim Al atwani , a 38-year-old teacher from the overwhelming Sunni part of amariyah , returned with his two children , because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not permit to work Iraqis .
His Shiite neighbors in amariyah called him in order to say to him that a militia local , supported by the USA helped Al-Qaeda from their bastion in the west of the capital , and to expel insisted it for the return .
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe of the from his house in sleikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with grenades had been expelled , after he had requested its fellow citizens for fight .
He returns in order to fight .
`` two days ago , some of my friends called me and told me that they began one the Al-Qaida militia in sleikh and that it my support and that of my boys need it .
This is why I have returned today `` , said sabaah alu , 62 .

More than two and a half million people are probably from the sectarian death squadrons in the country .

`` I can not trust a government which supports the criminals , the House burned down after I went away . ''
A part of the reason for the drop of the power is that Sunnis from Shiite residential areas and vice versa were expelled , which led to the creation of many places where tensions have eased .
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will stir sectarian tensions up again and it will come to conflicts .

Budget is through
Yes , it is created .
The national budget is approved .
What is special one at this budget ?
It is the first budget which this government has designed and without the support of the opposition by the coalition was accepted .
For the current year was still with support of the cssd ( social democrats ) , approved because it Minister sobotka ( of this party ) had submitted , and the cssd could not allow it therefore rejecting him .
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government nothing dramatic happened this time .
The Parliament approved this traditionally few paid attention to , nevertheless highly important law in all peace .
This is to a certain extent paradoxical .
Rules over everything begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget , whether one likes this or not .
The budget is an essential component of the politics , however , is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition .
That is for the media a more grateful topic , and therefore they devote more attention to him .
A controversy among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober numbers .
The national budgets suffered at the past social democratic governments under three weak points , which the budget for the year 2008 not on once : can eliminate
The first is the high share of expenditure because of law obliging , at which it is not only about the pensions , but also about social expenditures , which the `` silent '' coalition of cssd and ksm ( Communists ) in the last year before the elections has concluded .
The second is the account budget policy as a result of the first .
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances , i.e . the budget deficits of the local authorities .
The greatest risk is not , however , the state budget deficit .
This budget is public and one javelin measures under control .
However , a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the local authorities .
Many mayors spent , about except incomes from taxes , taxes and bank credits further sources for investments , often mostly from bonds , by which they caused their city halls in the excess .
In the last years , they succeeded , these debts by massive sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks , the them in the train had received from the State to pay off .
Now is this source already dried up .
As far as we ourselves only at official and verifiable facts , we notice that :
Our economy for some years , like the rest of the world , a growth through , whose the cssd incessantly himself boasts .
This represented a unique possibility for their governments to take public finances into order .
Instead these governments were to blame for the state , however , still more .
Other countries , apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary , Albania , Pakistan or Egypt have much more reasonable than our Republic .
This is a giant disgrace which mainly be ascribed to the former governments .
We belong to the countries , which , in the global scale , seen at the least of poverty are threatened .
Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary , which unfortunately just in the last few years quite in gigantic extent was blown up .
Even if it is successful , a part of the unreasonable populist expenditures , which were adopted this year before the elections , to paint , is clear , that if it does not come in next time to a shift of the pension entry age and to a pension reform comes , then virtually any politics in this country , and , very now who is in power , he will not have anything as a pure administration .
It is only easily exaggerated , if one says that then from ruling politicians officials become , the largest part of the tax revenue mechanically up on pensions and social expenditure .
Therefore the this year 's budget can not be a revolution , but can only to the displacement of normal expenditures by duty areas .
The deficit provided for 2008 of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if earlier governments in the last ten years would have not distributed , which only went .
If we do n't want that it really comes to that from ruling politicians pure verwaltungsbeamte become , then we must be patient and this is not too strong coalition government , however , which is conscious that the state can spend only so much , as it is at taxes and fees to take in the situation is quiet at the preparation of further reform laws .
Only these make a gradual penetration of a balanced national budget .

Nevertheless declared itself the Republican candidate for the Presidency , in the long run ready to place itself to a debate on , in the normal voters on video take and submit questions , in order to send it to the candidate .
None of the questions , which on Wednesday evening , the 28 November , were raised , were so ridiculous as the snowman , the Democrats ' about the global warming in the the debate of the other party .
But the questions , and the answers , reflected this time exactly the condition of the Republican Party which opens bursts in the elections next year .

However in the first half hour of the debate , the longest the a single topic was dedicated , immigration stood in the Center .
The subject is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans .
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial if they heard things which they liked : the television noticed points of the agreement as the candidates strictly spoke about the limits .
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between rudy Giuliani , the national forerunner and romney , the itself in the crucial inquiries in iowa and new Hampshire forwards . Has pushed
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call , he is flexible with regard to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York .
He attacked romney in which it the former governor of Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for work at his house to have adjusted .
The two sat down particularly violently as interrogators wondered whether one of the candidates an `` Amnesty '' ( the illegal a regular status and the possibility on the citizenship would give . ) would support
More insignificant candidates as Duncan hunter , a California Congressional representative , and Tom tancredo , a representative from Colorado , it succeeded with this topic .
Neither of the two men has serious chances with the nomination , but both remain in the running , maybe because they earlier and harder than others . Have hit on the
At least in the area of the immigration , the candidates in the great and divide the same opinions : sharper borders , intolerance in comparison with illegal migrants .
This topic , together with fears about poisonous toy from China or other worries over the rest of the world , help the republicans the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives to forget or to minimize .
But the debate was obviously problematic as other topics for the language .
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported weapon restrictions in the past .
John McCain and romney discussed about whether simulated drowning should be considered as torture .
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible .
This led to the fact that Giuliani represented the point of view that although the Bible is its preferential book , he the history of jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale .
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
MIKE huckabee - now towards all expectations on the first place in a survey recently carried out in iowa thanks to his Christian conservativism existing for a long time , said that the death penalty is painful but necessary .
When he was pushed on whether Jesus would support it , he laughed about this and said Jesus was too intelligent in order to apply for a political office .
The race remains extremely wide open .
Huckabees ascent in iowa falls together with Ron Paul 's recent donation successes and its storms in the debate of Wednesday .
These two are from the nothing , because the two wings of the party up to now not yet on one of the better known and more traditional candidates . Some could
In the year 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the outset and convincing United with a victorious message about the size of America and a winking to two wings of the party .

The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have access to loans , credits even more expensive for their customers .
That would reduce the consumption and the American economy into a recession , possibly with effects on the growth in the whole world .
The central banks have decided , after they had not succeeded , the so-called libor , lower the rate of the used with the moneylending between banks .

Bottomless swindler
So describes his former employee of the French bank giant Société Générale owner the local banka .
They came because of him around almost five billion euros .
However , it seems rather so that Générale was only a large player , who wanted to do it like his colleagues beyond that surely not was unable .
To the difference to all large banking houses it recognized in time the crisis . At the amerikanischenn mortgage
`` It is psychologically rather weak , '' was from the mouth of his superiors to be heard , who reported it to the police .
Like however from the statements , the result , the French media , for example the daily Le Monde , published , he was a human being , at the end of last year with its business of profits in the amount of 1.6 billion euro had obtained .
Crisis not only in America
`` everything I wanted was for my bank , to earn money , '' he says in his statement .
In the summer , he had managed just at the American crisis to earn half a billion euro .
The opportunity in addition he had already indeed at the beginning of the year .
In February , there were already first messages over that so-called mortgages as they low-income customers or such , who had already in former times , are given in difficulties would be fallen .
Influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis however .
Générale did n't believe this and was right .
At the end of the year , he had his profit up to 1.6 billion euro .
`` already than I had earned the first half billion , I did not know , as I should explain that , '' admits and continue to say that he has kept nothing definitely for itself .
During the whole interrogation , he admits that he falsified documents , so that one would not come him to the pulps .
He even succeeded to lead its bosses behind the light , even if the gradually , for eurex interested in its business .
Risk profit
Feared he to be exposed ?
Probably scarcely .
`` I thought , that they the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billion for the Bank , satisfies . ''
Where did he take the courage to risk so much ?
He had to work out his position gradually .
In the Société Générale it occurred in the year 2000 , immediately after he his study at the University of Lyon , had ended . A
His annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollars .
After two years , he was already assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars .
Nevertheless , he knew that he will never earn as much as others .
`` already during my first conversation in the year 2005 I knew that one watched me .
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development , `` explained the investigator .
But already soon after its entry the first great success came .
With the shares of the Alliance he earned much , by setting at the London bomb attacks half a billion euro losses on exchange of this title .
And that was the trigger -- he wanted more now .
As long as you make profit , we let you
`` this is like a snowball , '' he told the policemen .
But the bosses knew allegedly from everything , and / or suspected it .
`` as long as I earned money , one closed the eyes . ''
But then came at the beginning of this year . The great blow
On a single day he lost a billion euros .
At a weekend in the middle of January , he wanted to balance that .
When he came to work on Monday , he was already not more employees of the Bank .
And a few days later the Bank announced that it lost five billion euro on his account .
And how they came on for him ? the tricks
It looked suspicious through a vacation .
`` I have only four days from the previous year .
A broker , who takes no vacation is one , which does not want that one sees for him in the tickets , `` said definitively .

In the realm of Angela cloud
Of the unrealistic appearance of the documents that the coalition is as regards content is at the end - and that of her nothing more is to be expected .
In which country does this Chancellor ? actually
After their disconsolate appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag , and meaningless was , one must say : not here - not in the country , which must finally be ruled over by it .
The accusation that it concentrates too much on the foreign policy , Angela Merkel has rejected with a badly overbearing sentence .
This is provincial , she said and thus showed only that she does not want to understand , for it is a matter for the critics .
In the Bundestag , it documented recognizable for all as the reproach is very correct .
Since neither concrete interest nor to feel a feeling for the problems in the country .
Instead , Angela cloud presented itself : a lifted politician who flees in the foreign policy , and even there in the approximate . It remains
Example climate protection : she praises itself without brakes for the resolutions of holy dam , does not say , however , how the country climatic goals are to be achieved .
Anyway , the praise - so much immodesty would have the presumptuousness still two years ago .
Now she clings to the empty phrase that the upswing arrives at the people .
In this way it damages their image as a pragmatist , solve the problems instead of talking the world beautifully .
But in the realm of Angela cloud problems relating to domestic affairs . An edge appearance
Child poverty and the worries of the low earners ?
She has a few subordinate clauses for .
Is calling as it often makes a mistake as it around the surcharge goes .
Merkel needs three approaches there , in order to bring a halfway straight sentence .

Test Peugeot 207 sw : voruteile fades
In order to say the truth , I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206 .
Its handling characteristics were not much value , the quality of the gear shift , the guidance and also the processing could one as rather designate below average .
Now but his successor , the Peugeot 207 , is on the market , and this is about much better .
The combination with the designation sw is still a piece of further and only remains for me to revise my opinion .
As I had tested the classical hatchback 207 , I had to me , for example about the too small on the rear seats .
There are now no longer these complaints , because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer .
Quickly further
I go through only shortly , in order not to repeat me too much .
It is a quite excellent design , where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel 's objections .
There I would welcome a little more designerische organization , where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression .
The seats are comfortable and are the times past , where perhaps we complained about to short seats or head restraints .
Also the side has fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206 .
What the room supply concerns here as well , one can feel the increased dimensions of the body .
In the station wagon is also the already mentioned lack of , is eliminated .
Suitcases in the trunk
The main point at this car is , however , the cargo hold .
I must ( also because of the reverse window ) as very well beladbar and space-saving .
The cavities are equipped with safety belts , which represent an ideal compromise .
You do not disturb , make itself and hold even more difficult objects .
But let 's talk about the case volume .
It amounts to according to table in the basic equipment 428 litres , which in the comparison to the competition is a rather average value .
Though not in comparison to the vehicle of this class , the Skoda fabia combi .
If we the 207 sw with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav , compares we determine that the Peugeot around clearly perceptible 52 liters .
For a foreign vacation or while inviting a pram this value is already critical .
But in order to emphasize the positiva , I must still the loading space completely flat after turning the cargo hold or also the very low loading up edge .
120 PS in four rows
With our test car was with a four-cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and a performance of 88 KW . Equipped
And honestly said , so should have a look , which propels a family .
It is quiet , has a low consumption and pulls away well .
If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda , which sometimes works , as would be its exhaust with a rag clogged , then I can only be inspired by him .
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national .
However , we must remember that we are a well equipped car with a spacious innneren and a very good engine .
The basic price of the car with the 1400s gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still concerns .
With our engine it costs as 410900 crowns , which is already quite a lot .
The equipment quality of the test beats still once with 80000 crowns in addition to beech .
We had however bags , automatic air conditioning system , automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters behind and and ...
So the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns .
That is a lot , but you calculate once the additional equipment fabia together and they will arrive with a very similar sum .
Therefore only remains the decision , which mark one wants to choose .

Six as a deterrent , in order to annoy colleagues
E-mails which we forget to send , messages , which we never receive - harmless lies , the US do n't notice any more : they bring `` color '' in the everyday life on the job .
The question is whether one becomes accustomed to these small used , or provides one better to the challenge and attempts this misleading , for other angry situations consciously .
Tips .
`` sorry , I have forgotten to pass on to you that someone from the marketing department called '' -- a colleague says .
That one has missed a meeting through ?
At best one regrets it and tries it again when maybe one phones the marketing department and admitting , one would have forgotten to align the message ( this is the less usual method ) .
Is usually the thing with an excuse . Dismissed
Before one involves oneself in embarrassing excuses , one should consider , with which one his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments , and try to avoid these situations intentionally .
Something lent , which does not belong to one ?
There is hardly something sinewy as if one after a document , or the telephone , but it is not there .
Yesterday the notebook device still lay on the desk - it is today ? away
Or lost believed ball-point pens for instance on the desk of a colleague ? discovered
Without one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow , because they are annoyed , if they determine that something got away .
Thus , no covers or mail from the office put into the bag , because it could meet : no more there , if one 's nevertheless urgently needs .
Gossip about the private life of the colleagues ?
There is no effective means , a gossip , which was already put into the world . To stop
Who with whom ? , which made
Where and why ?
The one should information ( or assumptions ) about the private life of the colleagues after possibility not every tie to the nose !
And if someone opens and his innermost secret betrays us , we should not abuse this confidence !
Best one is silent as a grave , instead of just not present to pass on , even if others about the problems of the colleague also know .
Without reason ill ? reported
If one calls in the office , under reference to tormenting headache to ill , report because one just feels uneasy , or simply would only like to rest , one should himself about one : to realize the own work , urgent , projects with firm dates must now the colleagues instead of one themselves .
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore !
If one knows already on the day before that one it on the next day not into the office will manage , or that something could get in the way , why one must remain at home , one should announce it in time , so that neither the colleagues , still the leader unexpectedly confronted with the absence .
Hum , , giggle , telephoning
One is hollow just in his work , however , is suddenly by the loud giggling of the colleagues ? disturbed
Unintentional a telephone conversation overheard that one better should not have heard ?
One should not the colleagues with sums , singing , loud discussions ( the one leads over their heads ) , trample , continuing grumbling or nerves .
All this can be very disturbing , even if they are not just in a task ( write , plan , organize ) recessed .
Are always the other ? blame
Is a project is not ready in due time , one has an important letter or important realigns forget to send , one should not the fault of the own forgetfulness at other ! search
As far as possible one should not on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues !
Best one admits his errors , and apologizes , if others were affected also by it !
The question , how one the error again , or which missed retrieve can , is only too made !
In the office - a feeling like to home ?
Pants and schlapfen : comfortably for at home , but lost nothing in the office !
Not even then one should dress so casual , if it would actually permit the job !
Only not to become too - one should both his colleagues , as also themselves even as far as that respect one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired , also pretty and elegant !

Only in an education field the the same deficit as the rest of the country .
`` I have 'yesterday for the 50th time , that we are not French '' -- the smallest state placards this slogan ironically to his 50th birthday .
France and Luxembourg play a large role in the education system of the Saarland , which is in the of the Institute of the German economy Cologne ( iw ) on place five .
So the universities cooperate already from tradition closely with the neighboring countries .
The university in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 of the Frenchmen .
Until today , students can conclude their study here with a double or even triple diploma .
The share is correspondingly high foreign students with 15.6 percent .
But also the Saarland brings the onto the colleges in number above average - many of them without a conclusion at the high school .
`` in the Saarland one uses the vocational education system '' , expert , says at the iw .
More than every fifth teenager purchases his studies right at a vocational school , thus lies the Saarland more than seven percentage points over the .
Even the possibilities of a professional and academic education are comparatively strongly built up .
Measured in terms of the total population with the equipment is the dual courses is based in Germany .
In spite of the practical training and increasing demand , the number of the engineer in the past years , however , has dropped by a third .
Therefore the Saarland education Ministry engaged the universities now to a marketing campaign for engineer fan .
`` at the general education schools , we have after the first PISA study activated a few reforms '' , says a spokeswoman of the education Ministry .
So the Government introduced nationwide comparison tests .
In order that the children to learn to use to begin is the last kita year free of charge -- a model , which in the meantime also other Federal States copy .
Whether the achievements of the students to improve themselves , will show , only future comparative studies .
With PISA 2003 shrank , the share of the risk of 29 to 20 percent .
Altogether the Saarland did not however increase so strongly as other States .
The Bavarians count better .
And to the annoyance of the are at PISA not measured - in this area , one could score otherwise .
Because the language of the neighbours is at grammar schools - even if the no Frenchmen .

These are not warhols boxes
Who the concepts of Sweden and wooden box , thinks of Ikea , but not at Andy warhol .
? or however
Currently raise in Sweden dark shadow on warhols .
A majority of the ninety-four listed there of the `` Stockholm '' are forgeries .
After the Swedish newspaper `` expresses '' some months ago doubts about the authenticity of Andy warhols of of the year 1968 , has stirred up internal inquiries come in the moderna museet in Stockholm now to a result : the six `` boxes '' , which the former the of museum moderna museet 1995 as donation has bequeathed are copies -- and presumably also the major part of the another about one hundred boxes of the `` Stockholm '' , which are on the international art market in circulation .
The past history is encapsulated , a confusing chain of artistic and kuratorischer productions .
1964 created in New York its first `` boxes '' , painted wooden , which are on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the `` brillo '' . That
An exhibition of his works in the moderna museet 1968 issued - with warhols agreement - hundreds of brillo from cardboard : these were n't ( from reasons of cost ) of warhol , but they were delivered directly from the brillo-kartonagenfabrik .
It was n't around works of art , but their models , around bare exhibits .
At the same time warhol 1968 probably the permission , some produced few brillo wood crates in Sweden , to let the though were not exhibited in the moderna museet .
Contemporary witnesses are talking now about fifteen boxes which then as authorized original-andy-warhol-brillo-boxes with of the name `` Stockholm '' to right in the art and auction history .
Some of them have more than 100 000 dollars on auctions . Obtained
The problem is now that of the legendary director of Museum has claimed later by mistake , it is in 1968 about a hundred boxes in Sweden was produced and issued to him then left .
105 boxes were only 1990 actually in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg .
To this time was already dead for three years .
Lars bystroem , chief curator at the moderna museet , along with the six museum boxes also three from Swedish private property , of which two were made 1968 in Stockholm : their chipboards were primed and ground first , afterwards was White color with a brush . Applied
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 however tells that the with color without a painter coat directly on the laminated was applied - in addition it concerns not oil- , but around color .
`` these boxes were not by the artist and should autorisiert from the official list of Andy warhols boxes be removed '' , indicates the director of the moderna museet , Lars announce : `` if the 'Andy warhol kind authentication board ' in New York to another conclusion does not come , the moderna museet the six boxes in his collection as copies / classify . ''
Already in July , the authentication board has admittedly announced , to follow the `` heavy accusations '' in the area of the soap powder boxes are raised .
However since then , one himself there in relentless silence .

England confronted with decision over the statements by owais Shah and
Here two dilemmas , each of them almost just as difficult as the others .
As who should number 6 for England in kandy at this weekend , owais Shah or ravi bopara ?
And , not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka , who is supposed to make the decision ?
The second question is important , because David graveney , the , on call at least under this specific title , here is around the boss Peter moores and the captain Michael Vaughan to help to decide , and because the table of high morries , the English managing director , gradually with applications for national voter fills , if not even for what . In part-time
Who does not even always get the sixth , will be unfortunate , but the life is often unfair and the sport is it beyond doubt .
It is never simply to nail exactly what a human being made it possible the top of his profession to reach , while someone else over the lowest rank , sometimes from lack of luck instead of ability .
It is not only necessary in the , where the choice is difficult , where judgements are necessary , which are subjective at the end always .
Is it the right time for bopara climb up ?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it ?
The same can perhaps also in a wider range , be asked whether for example John edwards or `` tubby '' banerjee , both intelligent young managers with good conclusions , which know the business well should be promoted .
Who can say what the correct class for a cricketer , unless the possibility is given to him swimming or going down .
Numbers have of course a large influence on decisions , but chances also have this .
Within a team a cricketer must the eye of the captain to the right time catch , if he can take a wicket and a must get regular chances on the order , if he wants to do impression as a one-day .
To catch the eyes of the selectors is more complicated .
There were many , which in the last season better than , for example , as James Anderson were apparently in the first test , will play even if Stephen harmison declares itself as healthy and as the wind in the nets .
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with each 33 runs in order to earn a position in this tour .
Chris tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average , but both had their highlights and hope on still more .
Whether Shah or bopara in the asgiriya stadium , plays a only can be .
The choice could decide the careers of both men , or it perhaps however makes little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka played Gareth batty in every test and was successful in the first , with five wickets and 40 useful runs , it was , however , Paul collingwood , to consolidate then still fightingly around himself , the the breakthrough to an important testkricketspieler created and that , although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia , perhaps still underestimated .
Probably is that graveney , Vaughan and moorland , after a further discussion in the course of today 's meeting in the asgiriya stage their conservative instincts and belly 's greater experience over net enthusiasm will follow .
There are arguments for both .
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay , 43 first-class hundreds and only six of bopara , which is seven years younger with 22 years , and an excellent balance against balls .
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in the may against West Indies in the test in Lord , his arena as a player from middlesex , and this , plus his immediate rejection of the selectors as Vaughan was healthy about his position for the next game to take back , seems the momentum from its striking to have taken the was obvious still in Bombay .
In contrast the has Jack of all trades from Essex . Essex
He is of nothing on a impressed and its attitude off of it was taken to the point , as he recently with a vehicle in an exhibition for England 's sponsor Volkswagen had estimated .
He suffered from smaller injuries and presumably a shock , but the first , which he did , was his Vodafone ( of course also gesponsort ) out and his colleague Alastair Cook , which had observed this from the distance , and with enthusiasm to say : `` have you seen this ? `` .
Bopara is a much better player on the field , he bowls his central speed with some effect here on the grounds , which seems to fit him and hits with confidence and destiny .
The right man to select a thing , the right time to choose a different .
Perhaps this is the real art of the selection .
I slope in addition bopara now its chance to give , which does not mean that Shah not stand there perhaps nevertheless well , if , as the tea from Ceylon suggests , it is that , will play here this weekend .

Wants to prepare - or as one becomes uninteresting for others
Stop and traffic , the car in the middle of the all back-up .
From the radio a strange : sang the sound of a violin , paired with electronic effects .
I turn the volume more highly .
The speed changes , the bass comes to the previous sounds , and as a real female chorus .
It is the song `` wings of love '' of zagar , that on mr2 .
The local music scene has us long time not just delicately with qualitative electropop .
But one sees even the back-up now differently if one hears the new album of .
The appearance of to , so some new and exciting production from the local digital underground contribute slowly to a change of the overall picture , and even if the garage with its gitarrengequit again `` in '' the domestic electropop proves : it gives new under the sun .
Balázs has begun in pécs , played instruments even in the band to , before he - perhaps , because a pub tolerates no two whistlers - his own way to walk on began .
The breakthrough with his project ( zagar ) and his music , which elements from jazz , electronics , and pop , together , but it created only as one with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film had approached him ( e.g .
`` szezon '' of Ferenc toeroek ) .
The formation , which originally had appeared in smaller clubs , was known to the wider public first , as the magazine `` wan2 '' their first album from the year 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and zagar , together with , to the almost only , also in the West marketable trendsetter .
And his band undoubtedly were `` trendy '' , however , no-one was interested in knowing whether they also like to bear this brand .
The band has reacted as it should : with a new , still better album .
The now appeared new album with the title `` can not walk walk fly '' could open new paths for them , however the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the pécser years .
The expression originates namely from the time when Balázs with yet another band was on the way .
The airy , flying allusion would be also in order , to fall , however , apart from the ethereal character of the music - the spirit of the time and the trends -- corresponding to louder guitar , the influences of the rock 'n ' roll on .
With these songs of the living in England and with the band `` the puzzle '' working singers gyoergy ligeti with the premiere in . Introduced
A song of the album has it even for the radio hit - since the one from early to pop music late mr2 pet the listeners with the number `` wings of love '' , which under cooperation of six local singers ( `` underground stars '' ) was taken the successive set .
Everything in order thus ( ? ) .
The hvg.hu has enquired at Balázs .
Hvg.hu : this new hit raises the question : to what extent does your music of a certain shift ? reserved for
Balázs : the term `` layer music '' does not mean me straight much .
In my opinion , there are two boxes in the pop music , and indeed not mainstream and underground or alternative and pop , but commercial and honestly .
Even the so-called alternative or underground can be shallow and meaningless , exactly the same , they can also , however , only for the sale be produced , which makes it commercial music .
Also a good can arise from an honest motive .
The acceptance of the listener functions independently according to this principle , independently of languages and borders .
Hvg.hu : do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign audience ? your music
B . zs . : abroad , particularly to the west of us the pop music has a greater tradition .
There not only teenagers or on concerts , but also the older audience there .
They pursue the trends in the pop music , which happen around them , much more attentive , because they also for a part of the contemporary culture . To hold
Hvg.hu : what role comes to the audience at your work ?
It is important , who , where , how much your music ? hear
B. zs . Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts .
However , we have never for the market .
With us the music does not develop , in order to serve a purpose , but from a certain reason .
The role of the public is usually marked with the concerts , where there is already a mutual interaction , but it gives again only in the unreachable changes of the moment .
Nevertheless , one struck me : you want to make it all right , you are not more interesting .
Hvg.hu : how far you like ? to follow the example of
It is as a soloist on the way and has his career in the West .
B. zs . We do n't really go his way , once completely disregarded the fact that one attempts again and again , this in our music .
We see rather than which on the musical presence of the other one trust and they unfolded .
Originally were naturally comparisons of our work with the of to inevitable , since several of us come from his band and have taken another way .
Hvg.hu : in the charts of mr2 pet `` wings of love '' stands at the first place .
Many have only in connection with this number belonged to the names .
Was the opening with a somewhat style in the direction of a wider audience ? conscious
B . zs . : we had no plans to write a hit , the then as a train horse for the album . Is supposed to serve
In this song , it is a matter of more .
It was meant as final of the album , with which we , the and the somewhat more difficult topics . Wanted to dissolve
Hvg.hu : how have you ? the six singers
Why just it , which was the guidance principle ?
B . zs . : the basic idea was to do a gospel-like choir .
Then the idea came to combine the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene .
So the six-headed choir arose - thus for sena , edina bori , judie jay , bori péterfy , [ neo ] , sena , - , we then baptized that `` underground stars '' . Have christened
Hvg.hu : you have the song exactly the same , or do have it the girls ?
B . zs . : there was the number already in the longer version , but as the material was ready for the album , we imagined that this number still `` needs something . ''
The chord has really asked for a singing voice .
I still have one sung the in the same night , she has learned the girls later .
It everything came virtually immediately and alarming spontaneously .
I can remember , I was then quite electrified , but it also has already needed the `` stars '' .
With my voice alone the song would never become so strong .
Hvg.hu : both on the plate , as also at the concert , however , one had the impression , the girls would be in the background .
It gives no solo part ( except for the short solo from jay ) , they have no own role , sings perfectly together and are not louder than the music , therefore their gesang't only accompanied by the music .
Also on the stage they stood behind .
? is it intention
B.zs . : that they are stood at the rear was so because of purely technical problems .
However we wanted them aware no solo roles .
In the number it also is all about that one to forget his ego a little bit should forget , who from where come and where is away , we simply allow us too , that these certain wings , the wings of the love .
I would like that others also feel this euphoric condition , which we have felt when the song has arisen .
Hvg.hu : which one was the most ? song
B . zs . : with the musical work work actually none , it gave more difficult tasks rather when mixing .
For example in the case of `` dorian Gray 's dilemma '' , in which I play on a , or in the case of `` rock 'n ' roll goes to the girls '' , where the groove did not want to function longer , but after and little everything turned out , as in the case of a puzzle .
Hvg.hu : which is your favourite number of the new album ?
B . zs . : that changes continuously with the concerts and also now where I have the album `` losgelasssen '' .
Currently there are `` prophet is a fool '' , `` escape from the earth '' and the number `` seed '' .

Richard gere is simply not cynically enough
With `` the hunting party '' and `` dreadful peace '' two films deal again with the Balkans war .
But both do not .
Either the concepts put too much on action and geballer or however they are too sentimental .
There also Richard gere in `` the hunting party '' does not help .
The good news : at first be sure the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide still in the mountains of the Balkans , but just there , in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia , now the actor Richard gere . Been found again
We had the most beautiful man of the eighty years finally from the lost sight of , because too many roles in for women and too many press conferences on the subject a Buddhism the desire on seeing .
Now Richard gere is suddenly the most important argument , `` the hunting party - if the hunter to the gejagten becomes '' ( why must be today actually always be so long and ? as train ) Perhaps anyway . Look at
He delivers a wonderfully winking representation : strictly speaking its war , the Simon hunt what from gere could have become , if the fate and the reporter were not so benevolent : a man , his very best times for a long time behind itself , but himself as a monument of his fall still preserved considerable residues of the former charm . Has
But in spite of this , `` the hunting party '' together with the German production , `` dreadful peace '' , which likewise starts in this week , only the endless series of failed . Continues
With `` murderous peace , '' one can make short process : the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo ( Adrian topol , Max riemelt ) , the a serbin from SAVE , on which the one promptly also still in love with them .
Although it is welcome that here once not the Serbs as exclusive root of all evil are represented , the loses itself film too fast in geballer and action .
It remains a kind of `` alarm for Cobra 11 '' without motorway but for that . With war
On the other hand it can to `` the hunting party '' almost exemplary , why it did not actually never yet a right good . Has given
The story of the three U.S. prepare themselves in order to the Serbian `` the fox '' with would have to track down another director and another film script ( both in personnel Union Richard shepard ) to another time maybe a new `` Apocalypse Now '' . Able to be
Because the stories are alike yes : small teams go both times in the forest , in order to achieve something , what the militaries not can and both times it becomes a journey into the insanity .
One of the reasons for the failure of `` the hunting party '' is that one is not Simon hunt not simply the descended cynic with heart , as the he is introduced to us at the beginning .
No , the script must it in addition still a romantic affair with a Bosnian murdered later .
Finally `` the hunting party '' go then the brook down , if the reporters within the last five minutes in the successful , what NATO , CIA and all of the world did not manage in five years : the war criminal catch and to the Muslim Bosnians for the fair revenge left .
This is so bad that one of the International Court of Justice in The Hague because of crimes against the call would like to .
The film has a deeply human request .
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still freely , and he suspects the Americans and the French ( here they are supposed to agree for once ) the following due to secret political arrangements too to operate intensively .
But the well and the bad are sometimes so similar that a famous comes into the sense .
It is called in it over the wood mask of an Asian demon on the workbench of the poet : `` I see the swollen front forehead , : how hard it is to be bad . ''
Films such as `` the hunting party '' have exactly such swelling heads , however , indicate how hard it is to be good .
The problem is not limited to the category of the limited .
Recently is in this newspaper reports that all Iraq films were large flops .
One can add : it also has never yet a good South . Given
Nearly always applies : if a star on the elements or mine fields of the world , then comes so something like this out `` Rangoon '' with Patricia arquette , `` beyond all limits '' with Angelina jolie or `` blood diamonds '' with Leonardo dicaprio .
All the conflicts are possibly from the point of view of time simply still too close .
It decades in any case had to pass before Hollywood with `` Schindler 's list '' a good film about the Holocaust . Was able to shoot
Some film will probably still the -- mature as classics now geltenden `` the deer hunter '' , `` Apocalypse Now '' or `` full metal jacket '' are at that time really by no means unanimously been celebrated as masterpieces .
But maybe we know today , where every mass murder in real time on two screens to immediately comes home , also simply too much about the conflicts of the world .
And that robs the screenplay writers of the , which needs it in order to tell good stories .
`` existence or '' or `` the great dictator '' are really finally therefore as well , have become so good because lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime . There was really
Perhaps , one may not want to be good , if one wants to make good films .
Perhaps the one must disassociated artist look of the Lawrence Norfolk .
Than the to parallels between its historical novel `` lemprières dictionary '' and Balkan war was questioned , he answered : `` that is only because of the fact that some things never change .
Cities will be always terribly dangerous , people will always be murdered in dreadful way and always there will be war in Yugoslavia. ``

New fears over natural gas controversy between Russia and the Ukraine
A new price quarrel between the Ukraine and Russia , which increases the danger that Russian exports of fuel are impaired to Western Europe .
The largest part of the Russian natural gas exports to the European Union ( EU ) is conducted by the Ukraine and every argument between the two nations is watched very exactly .
Kiev has warned that if the Moscow the price that it must pay for the natural gas increases , it from Russia higher transit charges into account will put .
A former conflict between the two states in the last year reduced supplies in the European Union states .
The latest quarrel between Kiev and Moscow happened at a time , to which the Ukrainian Government and the Russian , state gas monopoly Gazprom try to achieve an agreement about it , how much the Ukraine for Russian natural gas in the year 2008 . Must pay
According to Gazprom , more must be charged to the Ukraine , since the company agreed up to 50 % for natural gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan to pay .
Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine 40 % more for the imports of Gazprom . Must pay
`` It is important for us , our arguments as one of the most important in the case of conversations to use '' , said the Minister of economics of the Ukraine of the news agency Reuters .
`` The changing natural gas prices should certainly be connected with our arguments regarding the amount of the transit charges [ to Western Europe ] over the Ukraine . ''
In the last large natural between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 cut Gazprom deliveries in the Ukraine .
This led in consequence to a case of the exports to Western Europe , which drastically pushed the prices in the height .
Russian gas constitutes a quarter of the supply of the European Union .
Russia has the world 's largest gas deposits but much of this remains underdeveloped .
The consequence is that Gazprom completes its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations .

Cut at the most expensive , Tesco increases by nearly a fifth
The hypermarkets in also have this year the average increase in prices of 16 % of the last year , with the difference that it this year no increase in the value-added tax .
Article from napi gazdaság
In the budaörser has the price of the usual Christmas of the `` napi '' also this year by 16 percent , though has increased in all were price increases of over 1,000 hooves . Registered
After the prices in the food markets in last December , `` have '' , the price increase has n't turned out drastic , compared with the anyway high , earlier level .
However , it has an effect on the consumers certainly deterring that that , for which they last year still far under 9.000 had paid this year not even available for 10,000 . Is
The price of the `` napi '' shopping basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof in the investigated markets .
The highest price amounted to 10,573 hoof .
( in 6800 the price was at 6800 . )
The prices for unicum and live fish almost remained on previous year level , have increased strongly , on the other hand the prices for nut and poppy .
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary , with auchan gave it , however , for 139 forint .
There was no at the product on limited price slump with under 200 forint .
Here was surprising the price two litres of a Coca-Cola returnable bottle of under 200 forint , therefore the drink cost inclusive pledge only 257 .
Nevertheless performed this year in the `` napi '' cut at the most expensive , and cora at came off .
Our calculations showed that the prices in the `` napi '' shopping basket opposite the Christmas in the past year about 15 , while Tesco and auchan respectively increased about 18 percent .
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the this year amounted to 12 % , while the rise between the shopping basket of the past year and of the current year constituted 21 % .
The average price rise amounted to 1,480.00 hoof .
The average price increase still was in the previous year at forint , however , the added value tax increase at the prices to last Christmas . Manifested
Exactly this process has affected the trade terribly : apparently the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they shall use at the individual articles , since the effects of the price increase on the consumption were unforeseeable .
( if the vendor the circulation speed of a product badly plans , he can fall about essential profits in the price margin , according to the traffic intensity . )
The price increase of the `` napi '' turned out in the last year so radically that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 around 1720 exceeded , whereas the price difference was merely 844 forint at the cheapest basket . Amounted to
Such extremes were not observed this year , since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 forint more than in the previous year , and even with the cheapest , there was a rise in prices of forint .
In the comparison of the two last Christmas showed itself a disastrous price increase , the price of the daily consumer items in the hypermarkets in less than 20 months around more than 30 percent . Increased
( This in turn confirms not necessarily the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary : with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months , a more than a price increase .
So in about next to flour also with eggs . )
If one takes , however , a look into the `` napi '' shopping basket , this seems almost impossible with the latter , since the price level of the already in the previous year the product even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent .
Obviously there are flour suppliers in a stronger position than the egg -- after all , they could the drastic increase in prices on the multinationals . Pass
In the golden complain the hypermarkets do not ; it is reported constantly of good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more .
It from all large quantities are bought , durable food go into pallets over the counters .
Wednesday morning there were in all three department stores endless queues with the cash , as the number of the customers suddenly exploded .
However by the country a smaller customer frequency is reported , so that many multinationals complain with the pollsters , they could not achieve even the planned turnover , and indeed not only in the case of food , but also with lasting materials .

Political capital : Hungarian guard increases state risk
According to the department for risk analysis ( risk division ) of political capital the activities in this August with support of the `` movement for a better Hungary , '' Hungarian guard founded the risk of Hungary and the region in more respect .
In the `` risk '' of the Institute of it means among other things : in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk represents the `` aggravation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary , even at short notice could lead to violent ethnic discussions . ''
Main reason for that is the strategy of the Hungarian guard , which supposedly on the provocation of such a confrontation aims , according to the research institute .
As reported , will this as a failure on the part of the politically responsible persons : looked at `` persons of the public life have the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political grouping , which now their political strategy on the have built up '' .
One suspects that this intensify the problem , the rational dialogue impossible extremities favour , as well as the probability of violent quarrels would increase .
The forschungsinsitut means , the activities of the Hungarian guard would have , not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the local and foreign media , `` the picture of Hungary abroad substantially , in particular , what the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity . '' affects
We remember : since autumn 2006 , the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing , so that since summer 2007 several , `` national self-defense association '' organizations were founded .
`` these groupings it is common that they each case define themselves as civilian organization , while they boast openly about their members on - sometimes armed - Defense tasks of preparing ( disaster control , national Defense , ) , under appointment on the unsuitability of the police , the army , and / or the State itself , '' , it was said .
And further : that everything happens in accordance with that method , which tries , different , on the policies and of the population , based , political efforts as civil initiative . To disguise
The emphasis of the civilian character and the association therefore serve not only the evasion of legal hurdles , in the course of the registration with Court -- could emerge , it is at the same time a political strategy .
Like to be inferred from the analysis , the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk factor also for the relations with the neighboring States .
`` in the last months , the Hungarian guard was in several States as a potential source of danger , quoted so many a politician of certain neighboring countries sees in the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own . Anti
That everything has effects on the political stability of the region `` - it was called .
From the viewpoint of the research institute is the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not in , thus the political risk for the entire region grew .
As reports , the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of comparable to the Bulgarian national guard , whose foundation in August 2007 of the Bulgarian 's National Union ( bnu ) . Was announced
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard the stood the riotings in a district of Sofia ( krasna poljana ) have taken place .
The bnu has the incidents equal to the cause for the establishment of the national guard , with the argument that the aim of the organization is the `` national protection '' .
According to their opinion was indeed in the past 17 years a real `` terror '' marked in Bulgaria , the state however remained idle and indifferent - so political capital .
And further : the initiative would have an intense debate in the Bulgarian public . Kicked loose
As said that the increased risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to reasons .
There the activities of the Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows it is not to be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma likewise , with the organization of their own protection to react to the threats it is called in the risk of political capital .
Attila juhász , Director of research with political capital said on request of the report : the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute .
Every year would be published annually and should is tendencies be recognizable , the public opinion is informed , as in the case by the publication of the risk .

The fathers of the plant skirts back
Germany 's super of the seventies plays again : the three volume Members of harmonia planned their at a concert in Berlin before once more .
To the revival a monitoring appears from their large time `` live in 1974 '' .
Already at that time they were substantially more famous abroad .
The scheduled sensation happens then in the form of three gentlemen at the board .
Everyone has his box before itself , its cable and above all its buttons .
Dieter moebius sits enthroned in the flower shirt in the middle with 63 years .

Everyone contributes noises , sometimes even a beat .
And sometimes it makes mistake to a conventional piece of music .
That seems not even then also the gentlemen to greatly . Disturb

The brushwood did n't alone the self identification .
The now appeared CD `` live in 1974 '' was at a concert in griessem , before a scarcely record scenery , as someone to remember believes .
Came from rother , at that time , the desire to push and to practise it occasionally .
For solo and moebius an immoral demand .
The band explained its separation in 1975 .
Rother landed in one and secured itself its existence with albums such as `` fiery hearts '' .
Cluster was revived in the eighties and is since then more successful than it ever was .
The griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert groenemeyer .

Which insurance is suitable for me on ? the best
The motor vehicle insurance which a possible claim caused by the driver , covers contains a high cost , whose height of depends on various factors , among other things of age , sex , time of the preparation of the driving licence , family status , kind of the cars to be insured and its use , etc
To own a car is only the beginning .
Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance as the correct vehicle model .
First of all it must be clear to one with what we have to do it here .
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder .
This agreement is in writing by means of an versicherungsvertrags were recorded , which specifies that the society receives , and in exchange is engaged with a case of loss the appropriate sum paid in compensation .
The premium is the price of an insurance consists through several factors , among others age , sex , time of the preparation of the driving licence , family status , kind of the vehicle to be insured or its use .
The insurance set their prices according to the statistics , so that with a more severe danger of accident also higher payments are due .
For this reason both via women less contribution payments achieve , because statistics prove that these groups thanks to their caution . Show a smaller accident rate
The same also applies to married people , since this according to statement of the statistical values and therefore also after conviction of the enterprises , to fewer accidents tend as singles .
The use , which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and thus also the probability of an accident .
The more frequent the use , the more probable the damage .
With the list of the bonus the insurances must take into account a whole number of points .
For this reason the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance , the most likely approaches his personal needs .
We list at this place is now the most important points , the one with the selection of an insurance should take into account , in order not only a power- , but also a choice oriented . To be able to meet
Under 25-year old meet with the choice of a low-priced insurance numerous obstacles , such as the small driving practice and the `` young '' driving licence .
Even if it is for an ideal insurance cover would be the best to sign a full , there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives .
The cautious drivers can select a full hull with , so that the achievements of an indeed fully covered , but offered at a low price .
This kind of contract includes that the customer a part of the amount that resulted by the damage himself . Must pay
`` the amount will before conclusion of the contract and based on the height of the insurance premium . This is more highly ever smaller the sum '' , explains Luis Noguera , main agent of Spain with Europe , for a mediation . On-line
Another option is the extended insurance , the the customer against external damages , not however against the harm arisen at the own car .
In addition , this type of the insurance would cover theft , fire and vehicle loss .
Here . A Council
If you are under 25 years old , it lies in your hand to lower the cost of insurance ; so your credit increases itself when trying to drive carefully and to avoid accidents .
A credit is a lowering of the base rate at the corresponding insurance company .
In the opposite for this purpose a payment a rise of said rate .
`` the height of credits and punishing payments hang from the society and their returns .
If the enterprise has a rich year behind it , can permit itself to increase the bonus `` , explains .
As soon as the 25-year exceeded , it is easier for the drivers to sign a contract . Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving the accident rate sinks .
Thus , it is the most sensible for a full comprehensive insurance with . To decide
`` normally the young people can not profit from their previous experience , both in the case of an accident than also at the time of the driving not '' , describe the Spanish chiefs of the European enterprise , and adds that the majority of the accidents in the second occur , after the `` fear of the beginner '' was put down .
Nevertheless , it is the case of a married customer , does n't have any children to effect a fully comprehensive insurance ; naturally only then , if it the financial situation of the appropriate person . Also allows
On the part of the insurers , married couples with children as the customers with the lowest accident rate , and correspondingly low as well from its payments .
In this case would be a full comprehensive insurance with ( at an amount by the 300 Euros ) the best option . In the case that one received a high credit , has recommended an extended insurance , the first to the third shows commitment .
`` they travel altogether more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power , which permits it to them , a higher payment of dues to set '' , determine Luis Noguera .
For pensioners it offers itself , with a full hull ( at an amount by the 150 euros ) , or an extended insurance , to conclude , the only at a sufficiently high credit .
Finally one must observe that the car insurance is something very important , not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages , but also because they high costs , which require it , that a thorough selection is met , which corresponds to our personal situation .

An aspect , however , dampened his joy : that is exactly what me this is injured ; not , that we a higher growth , but that we had smaller losses `` , he stated .

The market value of other stock market , however , increases ; in the case of sogecable on 3,571 million , with prisa ( publisher of the magazine cinco ) on 2.518,53 million and at vocento on 1,779 million .
The comparison with antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is a question of two similar enterprises , according to Vasile .
Still appears uncertain the question to what extent we in fact , technically can act at what price and as we it on the customer level lucrative can make .
Telecinco explained its plan a week ago , this year to the first TV station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising . This assured guiseppe tringali , the managing director of Telecinco and the advertising enterprise of the group .

The main factor for the better in the comparison of the analysts see , with the high payout , the the company could show up to the present time : 2006 led the enterprise guided by Alejandro . A 100-prozentige
Vasile assures , however , that the reason after the purchase of 33 % of the shares of endemol with MEDIASET as a holding company , still could vary , even if it is still too early for an official announcement . Is
`` We are obliged to the official compromise , at least 50 % of the shares out even if we indicated so far always substantially more .
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year , whose stocks we through the purchase of 33 % of the final . Were already able to increase
According to statement of the analysts at the time of certain loss tendencies .
Lehmann brothers reduced only recently its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4 % and for 2009 by 7 % .
This is the result of the cut in the expected growth rate , the 2008 from 10.5 % on 8.4 % and in 2009 of 5.5 % to 5.1 % . Will diminish
This also has the prospective calculation of antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5 % and for 2009 by 7.5 % .

Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown still has a further pit for falling ; its way from this remains the same .
For British scandals , this is not particularly slippery .
No titles seem sold , Parisian pays no politician , no hotel bills toes . To have been
However the exposure , that a rich businessman donations for the British governing Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds ( 1.3 million dollars ) over four years under the name of other people masked , and that the party failed to announce this , is something without that contested Gordon Brown well would have managed .
Than two months ago the Prime Minister the demand after a choice had escaped way the intelligence of the British insulting , by claiming that opinion polls would not have affected this decision , there was hope that he would offer a robust , efficient government .
Instead , such as vince cable , the increasingly astute agency chairmen of the Liberal Democrats , it expressed , the once dreaded Brown has developed from Stalin to Mr. bean .
The awkward rescue of northern rock , a shattered bank , showed regulatory weakness and bad judgement under bombardment .
Badly thought-out proposals for the change of the revenue laws have set enterprise associations against the government .
The loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative bunglings .
A trio of generals in the retirement started a revolt in the House of Lords from protest against reductions of military expenditure : ministers of the armed forces to be , so they claimed , a partial time job is .
Now there are the various contributions of David Abrahams ; Peter Watt , labours Secretary-General ( and their former fulfillment ) is already resigned .
Nothing of that means that brown direction breaks up withdrawal .
Nevertheless , governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossibly to rule .
Still being allowed to people trust in politicians , but they usually hold back their scepticism if a new troop takes the office .
If it is clear once that it is improbable that a Prime Minister improves the situation and it does not even need long in this case to be , this delay is past : the public service begins to become leaky ; the cabinet to start ; the press looks for bad news ; and the government is defensive and aimless .
On a way the position of brown is particularly difficult , because he in contrast to other political leaders can not say , to be a new broom .
So with pleasure he Tony Blair would deny , it was his . Lieutenant
The problems with northern rock and the , for example , hang together with decisions which brown made as a Chancellor of the Exchequer .
And even if the was not directly involved in Blair 's misfortunes - as in the case of the `` money for nobility '' investigation of political party financing - go to the voters , possibly from this that he was it .
In spite of that situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The offenses are not so terrible as the Conservatives describe it .
As in the case of Mr. bean , nobody died , or was entirely cheated .
And the antidote , painful as it may be , is to be delivered , which of course Stalinist tendencies always promised : a reliable , solid and easy brutal government .
The new fuss about political donations is a good example .
The garboeske Abrahams , which compares his donations with his non-profit gifts , says he wants no public recognition for its goodwill .
This may be perhaps so , but the decision it was n't entitled to it .
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist from a clear reason : the public has a right to know who can buy entrance to those , which govern the country .
Watt , the says he would have known about Abraham 's agreement , but not that it is illegal , will have to position itself some questions obviously ; exactly as labours main finance recoverer the over the separate contributions in October . One told
But so far Brown is not involved : there is nothing that indicates that he knew from these confusion , although the largest part of the payments made after his taking office in June . That was
Up to now the Prime Minister finished half of the work .
He has fast the violation of the laws by his party , but sentenced he diluted this determination by reaching for a well-known instrument , a committee of inquiry to the topic - led , in order to make the measure full , of a bishop in the retirement and a judge .
In this case the `` teachings to be pulled out of '' not very complicated .
If the law was broken , it is a matter for the police .
Apart from that , there are other things to make the Mr. brown must , as something of a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life , to find the is vacant for six months , and to make progress with a drastic reform of political party financing .
That would require from the hardliners of the labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps the special financial relationship with the trade unions to abandoning - bitter pills for a party Member like Mr Brown .
But he should be conscious of some partial facts .
The Conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion polls ; he has two years to win voters back ; and the only way , as he can reach a victory is competence by incontestable honesty and solid .

Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of the freedom .
What you always expect of your vacation , that will be fulfilled if you select only the right thing .
Golden and white beaches , high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond .
Palms and all inclusive with waiters , the pizza , ice at the beach and beguiling cocktails . Offer
Kitesurfing , Gulf and roulette .
On the islands of the Caribbean , you find that in measure .
Only on an island you find however still much more , and this island is Cuba , the largest and most beautiful of the big Antilles .
In the time of the Spaniards Cuba was the bastion for the capture of America .
It called Columbus the most beautiful place which has seen per a human eye .
Havana was once a warehouse or transit camp of treasures , the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe .
And then the American epoch came .
The hotel Nacional originated in completely at the end of the 20th century .
Build it left to one of the leaders of the American mafia , Lucky Luciano , because everything what applied in the USA as crime ( particularly during the prohibition ) was seen with pleasure on Cuba and supports - drugs , gambling , prostitution .
Among his guests were among other things .
Winston Churchill , ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
In Havana high-rise buildings increased over the broad boulevards , the cars , drove to the cult symbols of the fifties of the ritual . Among
Ernest Hemingway bought a estate in San Francisco de Paula , in the closeness in and he had his yacht lie .
On the walls of the bodeguita del Medio star of the show business and politicians from the whole of America . Their signatures
? and today
On the walls of the bodeguita of Havana also you can leave your autograph .
At the bar in the hotel Nacional , one for them after cocktails very desire .
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana until today because the imported once and Fiat in salty and damp air fell apart a long time ago .
Likes to Havana , in particular its oldest part , heavily , anywhere finds one in the periphery so many colonial objects of interest here as straight .
Other places are just decorated , for example , Trinidad .
In regard to it that the tourism brings urgently needed money , it gave it for this development green light .
In the last fifteen years not only in Havana new hotels developed , but also in varadero , at the coast of the province holguín and also on islets as cayo Coco , cayo Guillermo and others .
Cuba still offers a quirk which is unique on the world and above all railway lover .
Of steam narrow plantations and took the sugar to the sugar factories .
Her car fleet was not renewed over decades , and so one sees there funny and fully functioning locomotives , whose lengthen contemporary elsewhere in the museum .
Excursion destinations
The places , can be the majority of the visitors from Cuba does not .
So one must about varadero or Havana not more in detail . Write
It only remains to mention that in the estate of Hemingway already mentioned a museum , whose visit that one , which likes this writer . Should n't miss
The viñales-valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba .
The luxuriant vegetation grows on chalky soil .
The mogotas , lime hill and rocks tower steeply from the valley on , in their hollow accumulated fertile soil , by the also weathered are covered by a thick vegetation are covered accumulated .
It is this valley where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco cultivated .
In its final form , you can meet him if you visit one of the cigar factories .
Possibly it appears some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV series `` major Zeman '' was turned .
Trinidad
An ancient city , which briefly after the Spaniards had colonized the island . Was founded
Fame and wealth brought her the trade with slaves and sugar .
The wealth embodied in the trim beauty of the small city .
The Spanish colonial architecture , strongly influenced by the later French settlers , has hardly changed since four hundred years .
Trinidad , between the sea and the escambray , sited , is such a remote place that there was still in the fifties of the last century was no road , the area with the remaining country . Would have combined
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unnoticed .
Nothing was built , but even nothing therefore torn off , each was glad that he had a roof over the head .
If one for Trinidad more than an afternoon time has , then , it is worthwhile to look at interesting places in the environment such as the beach playa ancón or the `` valley of the factories '' .
At the evening one should then in the Casa de la go , according to the darkness , and where the music not silent up to the morning .
Baracoa
This small town completely in the East of Cuba some describe as the most beautiful of the island .
Surely this opinion affected also by the way there .
Both roads , the lead from Guantánamo there , must overcome high and zerkueftete mountains and run by a landscape , which is hardly touched by human interventions high .
This Eastern outpost of Cuba took the UNESCO thanks to the nonlocal pristine nature in her heir on .
The best chocolate is produced there , in the church , one shows the Cross of Columbus ( in reality , it is about a hundred years arisen after the journeys of Columbus ) , and from the hill , where the former castle , the present hotel El Castillo , stands , are several board to see , of which El yunque is the best known .
About the coffee , the rum , the cigars , which Sierra , the Bay and the island of Isla de pinos , about the , the heiligtum of the Cuban patron caridad del cobre , about the santeria , an African religion , to which the descendants of slaves confess , over all that could write one many pages .
However , as one says so : looking better with own eyes .

Venus is the twin of earth
The Venus is despite their anti-life atmosphere of the earth as a similar ones so far meant : the European space probe `` Venus express '' has flashes in the atmosphere and eddies at the Poles were discovered , as they arise in the winter also on earth .
For nearly three decades scientists assume that it flashes on the Venus .
Now the European probe `` Venus express '' produced the proof - they tracked down electromagnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere : the flashes on the Venus fire in a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud , told Christopher of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine `` nature '' .
According to the famous `` ursuppen-theorie '' lightning the life on earth develop : thunderstorms shall have activated reactions in the ocean , which led to the formation of amino acids , the components of the life .
Not so on the Venus : `` if there were ever lives there , it must have been in the very early history '' , Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington .
Today there might on the surface of the Venus hardly give something lively : the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on the earth , there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees .
`` The Venus is perhaps the of the earth , but it is a twin '' , said russel .
Why the Venus , the the earth in mass and size so similar , a so entirely different development , is the basic question .
The start of `` Venus express '' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research , since since the beginning of the nineties no probe more specifically for the Exploration of this planet . Was on the way
The latest research results which now in several `` nature '' , be introduced after emphasize view of the researchers not only the uniqueness of the Venus within of the solar system .
`` they also show that the common characteristics of our neighbor planet with the earth are greater than first accepted '' , communicate with the ESA .
So the researchers found next to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole , also a vortex at the , the still substantially faster .
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the terrestrial winter hemisphere , a team of researchers writes about Giuseppe piccioni of the Italian Istituto Di astrofisica spaziale e hemisphere .
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers . Almost just as large
The also described as a morning or planet circles in just 225 days around the sun .
But he concerns a lot slowly themselves : a lasts 243 earth days .
Although the Venus with temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds of the earth , scientists assume that both planets had arisen under very similar conditions .
On the two water collected , which remained on the earth in oceans , on which Venus however lost into the area .
And while carbon dioxide on the earth in carbonate rocks , makes it on the Venus , the majority of the atmosphere .

The choice of the status quo
On Sunday , it will at the counting of the urns : 't get the mass of the Russians for President Putin 's party , United Russia , decide .
After a very barred election campaign , it confirms to her striving for stability , even after authoritarianism .
Three days before the Parliament choices , the Russian President Vladimir Putin an information broadcast on the public senders to the voters , which was already recorded , whose contents are kept secret , however .
He does this in his quality as candidate of the United Russia , the , for which an overwhelming victory announces itself .
Yesterday the President looked through when he greeted the foreign ambassadors and was content , a new target against the Western powers to provide the accused of the interference of its favourite topic during the election campaign .
`` We know the price of a genuine democracy and expects us honest elections , extremely transparent and open , without elections '' , he added .
From the point of view of the opposition they have there wasted .
It prangert one by suppressing stained election campaign .
The Communist leader guennadi ziouganov says , it would never have been such dirty choices , not even in the time of eltsin .
After the suppression of the demonstrations on the last weekend , is valid for Garry for bad demonstrating to five days detention had been sentenced , according to his lawyer to continue to ban .
`` the Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension , two much leading : questions on
? who will succeed as President ? begin
The office has yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections announced , the 2nd March 2008 ; the candidates have time until December 23rd to known . To make
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004 , Vladimir Putin not for a third mandate in sequence .
And now , no successor is found .
What role will play Putin after March ?
Prime Minister ?
Chairman of the majority in Parliament and the all-powerful party United Russia , the government and President ? will select
Whatever it will be , in the case of the Parliament or with the presidential elections , the previous power will triumph .
This is tradition .
`` the Russians have the mentality of the Homo sovieticus , they are not master of their fate '' , mean the sociologist lev director of the independent Center levada .
The historians ' Nikolai of the St. Petersburg State University even still goes back further : the civil society has itself in this country , the five centuries to Europe , was only very slowly ; the famous esprit de corps has delayed the development of individuality .
After the liberal reforms of the nineties Putin has again to the model of a paternalistic state , which was completely accepted by the population , all the more since no terror followed on this new paternalism , but a certain economic prosperity , Maria lipman means of the Carnegie Foundation .
Today the Russians renounce `` voluntarily with the personal responsibility '' , which they after the disintegration of the USSR briefly on the day . Have laid
`` which still for a long time ? ''
This phenomenon affects all social classes , including the business community .
And the administration understands it to keep the status quo : 65 governors ( of 85 Russian region chairmen ) lead the local lists of the United Russia .
The freedoms new , coming from the West are often tantamount to chaos , as in the nineties .
The general public prefers stability .
In this sense , the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties .
Conclusion of Tamara tcherednitchenko , a 54-year-old Professor : `` which still consider for a long time ?
Those who are in power are not so bad , why they replace ? ``

British army recruits on

The with on miniature cameras fastened turned receptions are at the air force base in Kandahar are controlled and sent then to London , where they are put into the Internet .
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the air force have already contributed 139 such receptions , their `` channel '' more than 75,000 times . Looked at
The British Ministry of Defense was under `` defenceheadquarters '' in spring 2007 , registered videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations to publish , but also the British ( Commonwealth Office ) and the international peace troops stationed in Iraq ( mnfi ) have their own channels .

The air force has the videos originally with the goal of recruiting soldiers published , and as the Ministry of Defense says , the contributions serve also the purpose , the population about the real objectives of the foreign actions .
Such kind published propaganda is almost free of charge in comparison with conventional , according to Gordon mackenzie to the BBC , though these videos always carry a certain degree of political message in itself , since they the right of existence of the military measures decided by the government on its own way .

In many places at disinfectants
This year more than one thousand infections in hospitals were registered , the due to inappropriate handling antibiotics . Were
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals , the overflow of the beds , the overload of the personnel -- all factors , the the embankment of the infections not good at all , so are the leading doctor of the national epidemiology Center .
In many places also with the disinfectants .
In the traumatology-department of the to hospital recently an mrsa infection was diagnosed .
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient , after a serious accident to the hospital . One was
The patient was isolated .
At the beginning of the year , there was already a similar infection here .
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital , a little later had the man , however , with a mrsa infection to return . An important operation could since then because of the bacterium which still is in the body of the patient , not yet to be carried out .
Until December 10th this year were from hospitals activated by virus infections initiated at the national nosocomialis surveillance system , so the leading doctor of the national epidemiology Center , . Karolina
So many infections released by multi-resistant exciters were thus registered in the hospitals with security , but the true figure might be higher .
About two thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) were by the mrsa , the staphylococcus aureus resistant staphylococcus aureus . Triggered
The staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) bacterium contributes about a third of the people in their nose , without that it would cause an illness .
SA limited infections ( such as sore throat , tonsillitis , inflammations of the skin or wounds ) usually react well to antibiotics , they are well curable .
The means are however measured out too high or used inappropriately , arise from the well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics resistant , the under appropriate conditions in the hospitals . Spreads fast
In particular with patients with weakened , or durably badly functioning immune systems , but also in older , or patients with a low body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections , such as infection or blood poisoning , thus sepsis .
The medical director of the to hospital , according to the mrsa infection is nothing special , such occurrences . Belongs to the
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic , tibor nyulasi - there is not only there , where it is not searched .
Resistant to antibiotics
`` such patients are isolated , the nursing staff carry rubber gloves and masks with the supply , and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment '' - so .
With their admission into the hospital will the patients examined , nevertheless an infection can always be avoided .
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections in hospitals triggered by mrsa would be avoidable , however the currently reigning conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the containment of the origin or the spreading of the virus , says .
After this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and homes for the elderly , the taken patients should investigate and mrsa immediately isolate .
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not practised , however , so frequently .
Last but not least because it on the part of the national health insurance company no subsidies for this investigation .
The most cases would come to light before then , if the patient has already a noticeable has , so the medical head of the epidemiology Center .
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine , there are , however , also in Hungary to guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes .
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be , this means microbiological examinations are necessary , so that no resistance can form against the means , however this directive of hospitals are also not always kept .
Under the ambulatory , or in the basic supply the patient microbiological sampling are even still rarer , so . Karolina
One saves with the disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that mrsa from a patient on the other the most frequently by the nursing staff will transfer .
Just therefore the manual washing , or the carrying of gloves and masks are of a great importance , however , there are also on this area considerable shortcomings in the hospitals .
Mrsa is transmitted through droplet infection or contact in the local hospitals , however , There is n't always the possibility to isolate the infected patient .
The rooms are even often overcrowded , the beds connected barely although it between them from the epidemiological view , a distance of at least 1.5 meters . That should give
Like karolina keeps on saying , it happens unfortunately in the financially less well placed hospitals even that with disinfectants is saved , it gives few nurses , many patients - all factors , which almost favour the emergence of infections .
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there and / or the further distribution of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are adhered to , so . Karolina
Government program against mrsa
In the mrsa grip to get the causes Health insurances enormous costs , therefore they are fought everywhere .
In England for example , the prevention of mrsa , and / or their containment was held in the government program .
After first signs the program successfully -- as published data prove , the tendency of the declining in England .
The European Center for disease prevention ( ECDC ) has the prevention of the emergence of viruses ( under that also mrsa ) , as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities .

The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days .
Work-free days are mostly church holidays , or stand with important historical events in connection .
We celebrate new year as well , for example : both the last day of the old , as also the first day of the new year work-free days are - latter alone already thus the able to rest .
In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays .
The state are the 15th March , which reminds of the revolution of 1848 and the 23 October , the anniversary of the revolution of 1956 .
On 20 August the establishment of state , on 1 May the work , celebrated on November 1st and 2nd , we intend our dead ones .
In addition there are ever two holidays to Easter , Pentecost and Christmas .
Since our state , national or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall , the practice of the `` shift '' worked satisfactorily in the cases , in which we before or after the holiday only a day . Would work
The price of the extended weekends is , however , that we very probably work on Saturdays before it , or must go into the school .
When this day , which falls before or after the holiday , at long last , is supposed to be worked off , since long years by the Employment Minister in its own regulation .
The legislation is valid for all employers and recipients , for public employees and officials of the public service .
Only companies and facilities are excluded , in which the company without interruption , thus also at the holidays , is continued .
This year , the will still only rules by the holidays at the end of the year , somewhat confused : taken from the 24 December remains this country really stand since the most for the days between Christmas and New Year 's Eve , or the specifically for it waived vacation take .
In the next year , more holidays fall in the week Center , and / or on the end of the week , so that , at the working days will be less than this year .
The calendar will around the day of the work `` on the head '' , so that the people equal four days at the piece to stay home . Can
Saturday , April 26th becomes a working day , in order that the Friday , 2 May can be a day of rest .
The second change is connected with the holiday on October 23rd : on Saturday , the 18th October becomes one process Friday , 24 October first must .
The end of the year will however completely in the indication of the holidays , after starting from 24 December everything remains lying and standing , even if New Year 's Eve falls on a Wednesday .

Which companies will be affected by which behavior of the citizens is supposed to be changed , which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and what economic consequences arise from it .
More precisely said who must sacrifice itself and for the rescue of the planet will pay .
However , it has and there will be no such explanations in the future .
Just because it is a question of sacrificing and paying .
Because the measures , which in real terms against the climate change can be used are unpopular .
They are cost uncomfortable and dangerous for the accounts of the companies and citizens .
Even the gasoline cent suggested by the appeared seen Zapatero so dangerous that it saw itself forced to take back the proposal again .

Budget is by
Yes , it is achieved .
The state budget is adopted .
What is special about this budget ?
It is the first budget of the government has drafted , and which was adopted without the support of the opposition by the Koalitionsmehrheit .
The for the current year , has been with the support of the Social Democrats ČSSD ( approved ) , because it had submitted Minister Sobotka ( by this party ) and the ČSSD it could not afford to reject it .
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government nothing drastic happened this time .
The Congress approved this traditionally little known , however , highly significant law calmly .
To a certain extent , this is a paradox .
Everything governance begins and ends with the individual chapters of the budget and , whether we like it or not .
The budget is an essential part of the policy , but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition .
This is for the media a dankbareres issue , and that is why they devote more attention .
A dispute among politicians for the public is much more interesting than sobering figures .
The Member States have suffered in the last Socialist governments under three weaknesses , which can not eliminate the budget for the year 2008 at once :
The first is the high percentage of expenditure , which is due by law , but it is not just about pensions , but also about spending , which adopted the 'tacit ' coalition of ČSSD and KSČM ( Communists ) in the last year before the elections .
The second is the budgetary deficit as a result of the first Schwachpunkts .
The third restriction in the deficits of public finances , in other words the public deficits of local communities .
The greatest risk is not , however , the state budget deficit .
This budget is public and eingermaßen under control .
It is a veritable time bomb the budget deficit of local communities .
Many mayors gave to open up out of revenue from tax , levies and bank lending further sources for investment , often bond thoughtlessly by their halls in excess indebted .
In recent years , it was to pay this debt by massive selling shares of the energy and other networks which they had received in train the privatisation of state .
Now this source is already dried up .
As far as we keep to official and verifiable facts , we note that :
Our economy for a number of years , as the rest of the world , is going through a period of growth , which prides itself on the ČSSD without constantly .
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order .
Instead , the state-induced these governments , but more .
Other countries , apart from a few exceptions , such as Hungary , Albania , Pakistan or Egypt , have spent much more sensible than our Republic .
That is a great shame , which is mainly due to the former governments .
We are among the countries that are , on a global scale , threatened least of poverty .
This is why no nassiven social programmes are needed , which have been blown up in recent years , unfortunately , quite unnecessarily in record time scale .
Even if it is a part of the absurd populist expenditure , which were adopted this year , before the elections , to remove , it is clear that if it is not in the near future , to an increase in the retirement age and to a reform of pensions , then ends practically any policy in this country , and , regardless of who is in power , he will remain nothing more than a mere government .
It is only a slight exaggeration if we say that from the politicians , officials , which divide the bulk of the tax revenues mechanically on pensions and social spending .
That is why this year 's budget is not a revolution , but it can only put an end to the displacement of normal expenditure by Pflichtausgaben .
The scheduled for 2008 deficit of 70 billion kronor would be superfluous if previous governments would not have been spent in the last ten years , which was only .
If we do not want it really comes to mere administrators from ruling politicians , then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government which is aware , however , that the state can only spend as much as it is to take on taxes and charges in the situation , calm in the preparation for further reform laws .
This will enable a gradual implementation of a balanced budget .

Allies in Afghanistan are passive , the Americans say .

New fears about Erdgasstreit between Russia and Ukraine
A new Preisstreit smouldering between Ukraine and Russia , which increases the risk that Russian exports are affected by fuel in Western Europe .
The largest part of the Russian Erdgasexporte in the European Union ( EU ) will be guided by the Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations will be monitored very closely .
Kiev warned that Moscow has to be increased if the price we have to pay for the gas , make it higher Transitgebühren by Russia .
A former conflict between the two states in the last year reduced supplies in the Member States of the EU .
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow to achieve what is happening at a time of the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State Gasmonopol Gazprom try to reach agreement on how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in the year 2008 .
According to the Gazprom Ukraine must be calculated , as agreed by the company had to 50 % to pay extra for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan .
Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine must pay for 40 % more for the imports of Gazprom .
'It is important for us to use our arguments , as one of the main Gastransitstaaten during talks ' , the Minister of Economic Affairs Ukraine Anatoly Kinakh Reuters said .
'The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked with our arguments on the level of Transitgebühren [ ] on Ukraine to Western Europe ' .
In the last major Erdgasstreit between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 , Gazprom supplies cut in Ukraine .
This resulted in a result on a case of exports to Western Europe , what pushing prices high .
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the supply of the European Union .
Russia has the world 's largest gas underdeveloped , but much remains .
The consequence is that Gazprom with its own supplies gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian complements former Soviet nations .

Everything still open
Mitt Romey said that he is not worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a Schneemann .
Nevertheless , the Republican candidate for the presidency agreed at the end of the day , a debate on YouTube , include in the ordinary voters questions on video and table to send it to the candidates .
Any of the questions which have been raised on Wednesday evening , 28 November , were so ridiculous as the Schneemann , interviewed on global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party .
But the questions , and the answers spiegelten precisely at this time , the state of the republican party , which is on his way in the elections next year .
It is not known , as well as the producers of CNN , sometimes fail the debate , which identified the potential candidates to zeigenden YouTube Clips .
However , in the first half-hour of debate , the longest was devoted to a different issue , immigration in the heart .
The issue is one of the most potent issues for Republicans .
The CNN asked a group of hybrid voters to operate a Wählscheibe if they heard things liked them : the television station said leaders of the approval of the candidates as strictly on the borders .
The ultimate and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani , the national leaders , and Romney , has shelved in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire forward .
Tried Giuliani shake the reputation , he had been lax about illegal immigration , when he was mayor of New York .
He was attacking Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts , illegal immigrants to have to work on his house .
The two dealt particularly violent as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates would support a 'amnesty ' ( the illegal immigrants ) would be a regular status and the opportunity to citizenship .
Relatively unimportant candidates as Duncan Hunter , a kalifornischer Kongressabgeordneter and Tom Tancredo , a Kongressabgeordneter from Colorado managed to persevere with this issue .
None of the two men has serious opportunities in the nomination , but both remain in the race , perhaps because they have been hacked earlier and harder than other on the Immigrationspauke .
At least in the area of immigration , the candidates broadly share the same views : more stringent limits , intolerance towards illegal migrants .
This issue , together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world to help the Republicans to forget or to minimise the differences between the Liberal and Christian Conservatives .
However , the debate has clearly problematic than other issues have been raised .
Mr Giuliani was asked why he Waffenrestriktionen supported in the past .
John MacKein and Romney discussed whether simuliertes drowning should be seen as torture .
One of the honourable Member asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible .
This meant that Giuliani was of the opinion that , although the Bible should be privileged book he believed the history of Jonah and the Wal perhaps not literally .
Another honourable Member asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
Mike Huckabee - contrary to all expectations , in the first place , in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to its long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty painful , but is necessary .
When he was urged , whether they would be in favour of Jesus , he said was lachte and intelligent Jesus to apply for a political office .
Extraordinary the race remains open .
Huckabees rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Pauls recent Spendenerfolgen and his Beifallsstürmen in the debate by Wednesday .
These two are high kicked out of nothing , because the two wing of the party do not yet have been unable to agree on one of the better known and more traditional candidates .
In 1980 and 2000 , a candidate has the party from the outset and convincing together with winning a message on the size of the USA and a Zwinkern on both arms of the party .
This time , has divided the party and the result is far from clear .

We all want to make quite rightly - or , as it is for other interesting
STOP and go-transport , the car in the middle of the allmorgendlichen congestion .
A strange refrain from the radio erklingt : the tone of a violin , coupled with electronic effects .
Mr President I higher the noise .
The speed of change to the existing strains of the Bass , and as a genuine Klangjuwel a female chorus .
It is the song 'Wings of Love ' 'Zagar that erklingt on mr2 .
The domestic Musikszene has not just with us for a long time luxury qualitative Electropop .
But now we see even the congestion differently , when we hear the new Album of Zagar .
The appearance of Yonderboi , some new and exciting production from the domestic digital Underground-scene contribute to a modification of the overall picture , and the Garagenrock with his Gitarrengequitsche in itself is if ' , the domestic Electropop shows that there are new under the sun .
Balázs Zságer has started in Pécs , even in the bond Yonderboi musizierte before it , perhaps , because a pub with no two incompatible Pfeifer - to go its own way began .
The breakthrough with his project ( Zagar ) and its music , the ( elements from Jazz , electronic and pop verschmilzt , he has used but only when there has been approached with a request for the komponieren Soundtrack to a film in it , for example ,
'Szezon ' Mr Ferenc Török ) .
The formation , which was initially appeared in smaller clubs , only to the wider public , as the magazine 'wan2 reihte ' their first Album from the year 2002 among the top 50 domestic Alben and Zagar , together with Yonderboi kürte , for almost one , also in the West marketable trend setter .
There is no doubt that were Zagar and his band `` trendy ' , but not interested , whether they bear the mark .
The band has responded , as it should , with a new , better Album .
The new Album now come under the title ' Can not Walk fly Instead ' could open up new paths , but the title expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years .
The expression stems from the time when Balázs Zságer was still with another ribbon .
The luftige , flying allusion would indeed be in order , however , the - and the spirit of the trends appropriate - fair Gitarre , n the influence of the coat 'roll on not only the ätherischen nature of music .
With these Liedern of living in England , and with the bond 'The puzzle ' working singer György Ligeti has presented at the first in the Millenáris .
A lot of Album has managed even the Radioschlager - since Neuestem from early morning until late Popmusik mr2 Petőfi Hörern carries out the number 'Wings of Love ' ' , with the participation of six domestic Sängerinnen ( ' Underground Divas was ' ) , the Ohrwurm gradually .
Everything is in order ( ? ) .
The hvg.hu has Balázs Zságer in demand .
Hvg.hu : this new Hit raises the question : what is your music reserved for a certain section ?
Balázs Zságer : the term 'Schichtmusik ' means not just me a great deal .
In my opinion , there are two main castes in the Popmusik , and not mainstream and Underground or alternative and pop but Kommerziell and honest .
Even the so-called 'alternative ' or 'Underground music seicht and can be meaningless , just as they can be but only for the sale of produced , which makes them to commercial music .
It is also a good pop-number from an honest motive .
The receptiveness of Hörers also works in accordance with this principle , regardless of the languages and borders .
Hvg.hu : you You a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience your music to ?
Example Zs . : abroad , in particular to the west of the Popmusik has a greater tradition .
Since not only go to Twens teenagers or concerts , but also the elderly audience .
They are the trends in the Popmusik that around them , much more because they believe it for a part of the contemporary culture .
Hvg.hu : what role is to the public in your work ?
It is important that those who , where many hear your music ?
Example Zs . : of course it is good to see a good feeling , that more and more to our concerts .
We have never komponiert but for the market .
The music is not , in order to serve a purpose , but for a particular reason .
The role of the public is generally in the concerts felt and where there is already a mutual interaction , but there is only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment .
Nevertheless , I have noticed one : you make it all very disturbing , you are not more interesting .
Hvg.hu : how far you follow the example of möchtest Yonderboi ?
He is on his way and has built up Solist rather his career in the West .
Example Zs . : we are not really its way , in that we always tried to read any this in our music .
We are rather than Teamplayer , trust in the musical presence of the other and they should develop .
Initially , was , of course , comparisons of our work with the inevitable Yonderboi , several of us have come from his band and taken a different path .
Hvg.hu : in the Charts of mr2 Petőfi Wings of Love 'is ' in the first place .
Many have heard only in connection with the name of this number Zagar .
The opening up of was carried out with a somewhat populäreren style in the direction of a wider audience ?
Example Zs . : we had no plans to write a Low Countries that goes something like the should then be used as a motor for the Album .
In this song there is more .
It was intended as a final of the Albums with which we wanted to resolve the Klangorgie and the difficult issues .
Hvg.hu : as you have the six Sängerinnen selected ?
Why is it , what was the guiding principle ?
Example Zs . : the basic idea was to make a Gospel-artigen chorus .
The idea was to put together the voices of talented Solisten the domestic Musikszene .
So the sechsköpfige chorus has arisen - Sena , Edina Kutzora , Judie Jay , Bori Péterfy , Enikő Hodosi [ neo ] Juci Németh - we then apäter 'Underground Divas ' then .
Hvg.hu : you have just wolltest song , or it will have to shape the girls ?
Example Zs . : no longer existed in the Instrumentalversion , but as the material for the Album was complete , we thought that this number is still needs `` .
The Akkordenabfolge formally requested after a Gesangsstimme .
I have the tune eingesungen still in the same night , later they have learned the girl child .
There was practically everything at first sight and shocking spontaneously .
I can remember , I was quite elektrisiert , but it has already taken the 'Divas ' .
With my vote the song alone would never become so sharply .
Hvg.hu : both on the record , and also to the concert we had the impression , though , the girls in the background .
There is no Solo-part ( apart from short by Solo Judy Jay ) , they do not have their own role , and are not sing louder than the music , their singing is accompanied by the music not only .
They were also on the scene .
Is it the intention ?
B.Zs . : that they have stood behind , was a purely technical problems .
However , we wanted to make them deliberately not Solo-roles .
In the number of it is also important that we should be a little egos forget , forget who is how and where , we leave that these particular us wing , emporheben the wings of love .
I would like others too have felt this euphoric state that we have felt , as the story is created .
Hvg.hu : what was the most expensive song ?
Example Zs . : the musical Schaffensarbeit actually none , there has been more in the Mixen difficult tasks .
For example , 'Dorian Gray 's dilemma ' , in which I was on a Konzertklavier , or 'coat ' n '-roll Goes To The Girls ' , where the Groove did not want to work longer , but in the end everything has brought together , as with a jigsaw puzzle .
Hvg.hu : what is your Lieblingsnummer the new Album ?
Example Zs . : the changed with the concerts continuously , and even now , where I have the Album 'losgelasssen ' .
At the moment we are 'prophet Is A Fool ' , 'Escape From the Earth and the number of ' Never The Same ' .

Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean .
For visitors it really is an island of freedom .
Whatever you expect your holidays , that will meet , if you select only the right thing to do .
Golden and white beaches , high waves or a sea that is calm as a Teich .
All palm trees and inclusive with Kellnern which offer on the beach pizza , ice and betörende cocktails .
Kitesurfing , Gulf and roulette .
In the Caribbean islands , you will find that in überreichlichem standards .
Only on an island , you will find but much more , and these island is Cuba , the biggest and best the Antilles .
At the time of the Spanish Cuba was the bastion of the conquest of America .
Columbus put it the most beautiful place , the ever has seen a human face .
Havana was once a camp or Durchgangslager of treasures , who had stolen from the Spanish in America and then transported to Europe .
And then the American era .
The hotel Nacional was right at the end of the 20th century .
Build it was one of the leaders of the American mafia Lucky Luciano , because everything that was regarded as a crime ( in the United States , particularly during the prohibition ) , was seen in Cuba and support , drugs , gambling , prostitution .
Under its guests , among other things , were
Was Winston Churchill , Ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
High-rise blocks in Havana , on the broad avenues went grew cars which were the Kultsymbolen the Fünfziger years of the last Jahrhundets .
Ernest Hemingway bought a plots in San Francisco de Paula , who in the vicinity , and he had his Cojímar Jacht lie .
To the walls of Bodeguita del Medio stars of the personalities and politicians from the whole of America windstorms their signatures .
And today ?
To the walls of the Havana Bodeguita you too will be able to leave your Autogramm .
In the bar in the hotel Nacional mixt cocktails it for you to request .
And the Kultautos the Fünfziger drive around in Havana until today , because the once imported Schigulis Fiats have fallen apart and in the air-ecologically vulnerable and actually long ago .
Havana , in particular his eldest part may be come down , nowhere , it will take place within a radius of colonial Sehenswürdigkeiten as many wonderful as it is here .
Precisely herausgeputzt other places , for example , Trinidad .
In view of the fact that tourism is essential means of money , it was the green light to this development .
Over the last 15 years , new hotels are not only in Havana , but also in Varadero , on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco Cayo Guillermo and others .
Cuba is still a fad , which is unique in the world and , above all , Eisenbahnliebhaber attracts them .
The sugar cane plantations of isolated dampf- and diesel Schmalspurbahnen have undertaken to the sugar factories .
It has not been renewed Fuhrpark over decades , and so they putzige and fully functioning locomotives , their counterparts elsewhere have long been museum .
Ausflugsziele
The bedeutendendsten places is not the majority of the people of Cuba .
We on Varadero or Havana must no longer write in detail .
Is only mention the fact that in a museum is already mentioned Hemingways plots , whose visit the person who may these writer , should not escape .
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the malerischsten corner of Cuba .
On the extensive Kalkboden vegetation is growing .
The Mogotas , -felsen Kalkhügel and on the steep ragen Talboden , in their Hohlräumen fertile soil collected through the verwitterte Felsbereiche are also covered by thick Bewuchs .
It is this valley , where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown .
In its Endform you can decide on it , if you visit a Zigarrenfabriken of Havana .
It may be that some interesting , it seems that the Chilean consequence of the kid 'Major Zeman was made .
Trinidad
An ancient city , which was very briefly , since the Spaniards were invaded the island .
Glory and wealth expressed their the trafficking of slaves and sugar .
The wealth schmucken embodied in the beauty of the small town .
The Spanish Kolonialarchitektur , strongly influenced by the subsequent French settlers , has changed since four hundred years .
Trinidad , which is situated between the sea and the Escambray-mountains , is such a remote place that there were still there in the Fünfziger years of the last century not road , which would have the area with the rest of the country .
This isolation helped that it overlooked .
Nothing has been built there , but we must therefore nothing , everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head .
If we consider Trinidad has more than one afternoon time , then it is worth considering interesting places in the environment , such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of sugar factories ' .
Tonight we should go in the Casa de la Música , the relaunching of the darkness , and where the music until this morning is not silent .
Baracoa
This Städtchen described in the East of Cuba , as some of the best of the island .
Certainly , this view is also influenced by the way there .
Both roads that Guantánamo lead to high and must overcome zerküftete mountains and by a landscape which is affected by human intervention .
These eastern outposts of Cuba on the UNESCO , thanks to the local untouched nature in their heritage-list .
The best is produced chocolate , in the Church is ) the Cross of Columbus ( in reality it is approximately one hundred years after the journeys of Columbus , and the hills , where the former Burg , the current hotel El Castillo , are to see several Tafelberge which El Yunque is the best known .
The coffee , rum , the cigars , the Sierra-Maestra-mountains , the Schweinebucht and the island Isla de Pinos that Tropicana-Kabarett , the sanctity of Cuban Patronin Caridad del Cobre , on the Santeria , an African religion , commit themselves to the descendants of slaves , all of which one could write many sides .

Six deterrent , in order to get colleagues
E-mails which we abzuschicken forget Sprachnachrichten which we never get - harmless lies that no longer find us : they express ' colour 'in the day-to-day lives in the workplace .
The question is simply to vermweiden , whether we used to these small inconvenience , or it is better to the challenge and this is false , for other dangerous situations .
Tips..
'Sorry , I have to tell you forget that someone has called by the marketing department ' - says a colleague .
That we missed a meeting ?
At best we regretted it and perhaps by invoking the marketing department in trying to make it again , and we should forget reumütig ) , the news ( this is the less normal method has admitted .
In most cases , the matter is end with an excuse .
Before we got tangled up in embarrassing excuses , we should consider aware , where we can bring his colleagues certainly awkward moments and try to prevent these situations .
Something lending facilities , which are not a itself ?
There is little Nervigeres than if we according to a document Bürozubehör , or the telephone , but it is not there .
Yesterday the Heftgerät was still on the table - this morning , it is away ?
Or the lost tight meeting will be discovered at the hands of a gentlemen ?
We should not ask nothing borrowing by colleagues , because they will be if it is right to say that had little frustrated .
In other words , no Kuverts or post-its from the office in the bag , because it could be a itself : no more because , if one 's needs but as a matter of urgency .
Getratsche on the private lives of the ?
There is no effective means to stop a Tratsch , which was already included in the world .
Anyone who with whom , what ?
Where and why ?
We should not make the information ( or suspicions ) on the private lives of colleagues for every possibility to the nose .
And if anyone but to open up and gives us be innerstes secret , and we should not use this confidence .
It is the best as a grave instead of the is not here , even if other on the problems of colleagues also know .
Without reason ill reported ?
If you are in office , telephones , under the name of nagging headaches ill to notify precisely because we feel uneasy , or merely to rest , we should be clear about one thing : the own work , unextendable settlement , projects with fixed deadlines must now rather than a colleagues do for themselves .
The Members not blame game !
The previous day , if we know that we will not create the next day it into office , or that something could be somewhere in the middle , which is why we must remain at home , we should make it on time , so that neither the gentlemen , yet the head will be faced with unexpected absence .
Gesumme , Gekicher , telephones
It is engaged in his work , but is disrupted by the are suddenly Gekicher the ladies ?
Unwanted mitgehört a telephone call , that we should not listen better ?
We should not berate colleagues with sums Singen , talks ( we ) is through their heads , Getrampel , constant Schimpfen or Nörgeln .
All this can be very disturbing , even if they are not in writing ( a task , plan to organise ) deepened .
Are the other is to blame ?
A project is not ready on time , forget abzuschicken an important letter or important Nachrichte , it is not the fault of the own forgetfulness in other !
As far as possible , we should not finish your speech to the chaos in office or the gentlemen .
The best means of recognises its mistake and apologized , if others were also affected !
The question of how the mistake of lost ground again , or it can do so , is entirely appropriate .
In the office - a feeling at home ?
Trainingshose and Schlapfen : convenient for at home , has lost but in office nothing !
Not even then we should wear so too lightly , if it would allow the workplace actually !
Bloß not to be slipshod manner - we should both his colleagues , and also respect for themselves , so that in the office in accordance with you , if appropriate , also beautiful and elegantly !

This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies ( ) 24 % , as well as the poorly planned or unplanned births .

According to the Institute , which states that the percentage of Pillenverwenderinnen between 20 and 40 years ago , the use of the pill has risen by 5 % in 1970 to 60 % , the liberalisation of contraception has enabled a better  controlling fertility `` .

After the Swedish newspaper 'Expressen ' a few months ago , doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols has fuelled Brillo boxes of 1968 , internal investigations in Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result : the six 'Brillo-boxes ' which the former Museumsdirektor Pontus Hultén the Moderna Museet 1995 Hungary Constantine , copies are - and I think the majority of around one hundred further Brillo boxes ' the type of Stockholm ' , which are on the international art market .
The background is verschachtelt , a confusing string of artistic and kuratorischer productions .
In 1964 Warhol created in New York , his first 'Brillo-boxes ' bemalte Holzkisten based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard Seifenpulvers ' Brillo ' .
His work in an exhibition Moderna Museet from 1968 was - Warhols agreement , with hundreds of Brillo-from cardboard boxes : these reasons ) ( were not Warhol , but they have been impossible to directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik .
It was not a question of works of art , but whose models , a mere exhibits .
At the same time , probably in 1968 Warhol has given permission to produce a few Brillo-Holzkisten in Sweden , which have not been issued in Moderna Museet .
All witness to speak now about fifteen boxes , which are then as authorised original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-boxes with the term 'type Stockholm ' right in the art and Auktionsgeschichte .
Some of them have achieved at auctions more than 100 000 dollars .
The problem is that the legendary Museumsdirektor Pontus Hultén wrongly claimed later , be it produces around one hundred Holzkisten 1968 in Sweden and has been issued , the Warhol then have to leave him .
In fact , 105 cases have been Hulténs produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St Petersburg .
At this time it was three years Warhol dead .
Lars Byström , Chefkonservator on Moderna Museet , in addition to the six museum own Brillo-boxes three examined from the Swedish privately , two of which have been carried out in 1968 in Stockholm : their Pressspanplatten grundiert abgeschmirgelt were first and then , white Ölfarbe was entrusted with a Pinsel .
The structure of the copies from 1990 against reveals that the colour was entrusted with a Malerrolle without Grundierung directly to the Pressspanplatte - it is not a question of oil , but Acrylfarbe .
'This cases have not been authorised by the artists and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes `` , the director of the Moderna Museet , Lars Nittve , said : ' If the 'Andy Warhol type Authentication Board ' in New York does not come to a different conclusion , the Moderna Museet will define the six cases in its collection as copies / Ausstellungsmaterial . '
In July , the Authentication Board has announced to investigate the serious accusations ' , in terms of the Seifenpulver-boxes .
But since then , it remains unerbittliches in silence .

For each of the mothers of three million , the founding fathers of the two million and for the children per million .
The hospital 200000 offers a maximum for each set of parents .
The representatives of the hospital , Ondřej Dostál , is therefore not with the proposal Velebas totally opposed .
'we reject this proposal , it is many times too high , ' Dostál said after the current negotiations .
`` in order to be able to define our views on this but a counter-proposal , we need the opinion which drew up the opposing side .
We will see whether it has any longer .

Came to be UK Walachei Polívka
Bolek Polívka lost the argument about the brand 'UK Walachei ' .

'The dispute is that Mr Harabiš and his team at the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitär wish to participate , ' Polívkas lawyer said after the negotiations .
Put all the words `` Walachisches UK 'precisely these actors and entertainer .
Is of the same opinion Harabiš .
'We have an almost ten years of work behind us .
Fund-raising and concepts of activities , 'he said .
According to him , the dispute over money .
'The years that the project is successful and that they could have something that will have noticed them .
They want to parasitär gain in our work , 'he said .
Lucrative business
According to the court Polívka used the term 'Walachischer King ' for the first time in one of his television broadcasts .
In 1993 , the actors Radoslav Brzobohatý krönte him .
It was at that time , but not with the intention to justify a fiktives UK .
A few years later Harabiš came to the idea to spend walachische passports .
From an original facetious action a business and entrepreneurial activity clearly emerged is that the creation of the company Harabiš 'Walachisches UK ' followed .
1997 Polívka agreed to the use of its name and his signature in the passports and offered their owners reductions even during a visit to its Farm and its Theatervorstellungen .
Anyone who will sit on the throne ?
The judge argued today that Harabiš used only the mere idea which Polívka made in the programme 'Manege ' for his business intentions known .
'The popularity Polívkas has helped the project of the walachischen UK sure , ' the judge has said .
They also said , however , that the soul of the project are Harabiš and his team , who would have given him .
The cooperation of the today disharmony parties took until the year 2000 , when Harabiš for Polívka Vsetín organised in the official crowning glory .
Since then , but between Polívka Harabiš and began to combine the disputes in the removal of 'king Boleslavs I. elected by the Greek Calends ' culminated .

'We want to come to nothing .
It should be a kind of Königsumzug in the Walachei .
The King should be elected for a certain period of time .

In the poor by Angela cloud
The reality of the appearance of the Kanzlerin documented that the coalition content is in the end - and that it is nothing to expect more .
In what country the Chancellor live in ?
After its miserable appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag was wurschtig and content of the poor , we should say : not here - not in the country governed by their at long last .
The accusation that they concentrate too much on the foreign policy , Angela Merkel rejected by a furiously arrogant sentence .
This is provinziell , they said , and it only so that they do not want to understand what we are talking about the critics .
It has been well documented in the Bundestag there for all to see , as is their .
Yet neither concrete interest to feel a sense of the problems in the country .
Instead , Angela appeared cloud : a deposed politician , who is pouring in foreign policy and even there remains Ungefähren .

Now it is clinging to the phrase that the recovery out to the people .
So they do damage to its image as Pragmatikerin which will solve problems , rather than embellish the world .
But in the realm of Angela cloud internal problems are a marginal phenomenon .
Poverty and the concerns of the low ?
For a few Nebensätze has left .

In many places Desinfektionsmitteln cuts in
Today , more than a thousand have been registered infections in hospitals , which were due to the improper use of antibiotics .
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals , the overcrowding in the beds , congestion of staff , factors which are not conducive to combat the infection , the chief doctor of the National Epidemiologiezentrums .
Cuts are being made in many places in the Desinfektionsmitteln .
In the Traumatologie-department of a hospital János MRSA-infection has recently been diagnosed .
The antibiotic-resistant pasteurisation has been found in a male patients , was taken after a serious accident to hospital .
The patient has been isolated .
At the beginning of the year , there was already a similar infection .
The injured a serious car accident was released from the hospital , shortly afterwards , the man who had to return with a MRSA-infection . An important operation could be because of the Bakteriums since that is still in the body of the patients , carried out .
Until 10 December this year to the National Nosocomialis infections generated from hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant strains reported Surveillance System , the chief doctor of the National Epidemiologiezentrums , Karolina Böröcz .
So many , through multi-resistant strains caused infections were to be registered in the hospitals in security , but the number of unreported cases is higher .
Approximately two-thirds of the infection ( 683 cases ) the MRSA , triggered against Methicillin-Oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
The pasteurisation Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) is approximately one-third of people in their nose , without it would cause a disease .
SA-related infections ( such as Halsentzündung , Mandelentzündung , inflammations of skin or wounds ) usually respond to antibiotics , they are good it can be cured .
However , the funds be extent too high or inadequately applied , antibiotic-resistant , which are under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly arise from the good respondierenden bacteria .
Particularly in patients with geschwächtem , or permanently bad funktionierendem immune system , but also in older , or patients with little weight these bacteria can serious infections , such as Blutvergiftung Wundinfektion or , in other words Sepsis .
The head of the medical János hospital , the MRSA-infection is nothing special that such incidents are Krankehausalltag .
We should not confuse the infection with the epidemic , manhte Tibor MRSA Nyulasi - there are not only there , where they will not be sought .
Become resistant to antibiotics
'such patients are isolated , and health care personnel bears Gummihandschuhe and masks of supplies , and we have the necessary for the treatment of antibiotics ' - so Tibor Nyulasi .
In its Einlieferung hospital patients to be investigated MRSA , however , not always an infection can be avoided .
Rarely Probenentnahmen to
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals , would be avoided , however , the current conditions and conditions are unfavourable to the control of the creation or the spread of the virus multi-resistant , says Karolina Böröcz .
After this infection in hospitals and Altersheimen occurs , should the eingelieferten Spitäler MRSA-infected patients investigate and isolate immediately .
In the Hungarian hospitals microbiological practice not , however , being so often .
Not least because it on the part of the state Krankenkasse , no subsidies for this study .
The majority of cases , therefore , only then will come to light , if a patient is already a bemerkbare MRSA-infection , the head of the medical Epidemiologiezentrums .
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine , but there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes .
Antibiotic treatments should be targeted , that is to say , microbiological studies are necessary , so that there are no resistance against the resources , however , this directive will be respected by hospitals , not always .
Under the ambulanten , or in the service of the patients microbiological Probenentnahmen are even less so Karolina Böröcz .
In the Desinfektionsmitteln savings
Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA patients from one to the other will be entrusted to most of nursing staff .
That is precisely why the Händewaschen , or the wearing of gloves and masks is of great importance , however , there are also serious shortcomings in this area in the hospitals .
MRSA is transmitted through Tröpfcheninfektion or contact in the domestic hospitals do not always have the possibility , however , to isolate the infected patients .
The rooms are often overcrowded , ranked the beds close to each other , although it should be epidemiological point of view between them from a distance of at least 1.5 metres .
As Karolina Böröcz points out , it is , unfortunately , in the less well financially the hospitals even that savings would be made on Desinfektionsmitteln , there are few managers , many patients - all factors that encourage the emergence of infection .
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequently , or can be stopped the further spread of the virus , where these protective measures are complied with , Karolina Böröcz .
Emphasising MRSA against
MRSA-infections to manage the health insurance caused enormous costs , so they will be combatted everywhere .
In England , for example , the prevention of MRSA , or their containment was recorded in the legislative programme .
After the first signs of the programme is successful , as publizierte show data , the trend of MRSA-infections in England is falling .
The European Centre for disease prevention ( ECDC ) ) , the prevention of the creation of multi-resistant cause ( including MRSA , and the prevention of diseases in hospitals to one of its priorities .

Klimapropaganda
Since the Klimadebatte both the sceptics of climate change , as well as those who put forward a social and political debate in the foreground , a merciless criticism review , the movement as whole a strong cohesion .
Especially if it is a leader of the movement to which , as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero , the fight against climate change is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet  `` .
However , this proposal will bring it in Erklärungsnot concerning the action , or non-action of his government , which has contributed significantly that Spain is within the EU at the top of the list of countries which have complied with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol .
Who is responsible for the non-compliance with the rules on the sectors it is due , and why its government , which had proposed the  contract with the planet `` has not stopped this development .
In addition , it is now having to explain the Spanish citizens of the planned measures against climate change , without hypocrisy .
What companies be affected , the kind of behaviour of the citizens should be changed , what individual and collective austerity measures must be carried out and what economic consequences will be .
To be more precise , who will pay sacrifice and the need to save the planet .
However , it has and in future , there will be no such statements .
It is precisely because it is : the Aufopfern and .
Because the measures that can be used against climate change in real terms , are unpopular .
They are cost-rich , uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens .
Even the PSOE proposed petrol-cent seemed Zapatero seen electoral strategically so dangerous that he has been forced to withdraw the proposal .
Accordingly , it is important now is to save the planet with nothing , in other words with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences .

The stock exchange is a Endjahres-Rally before ? disagreement with the experts on the basis of the US Hypothekenkrise
With less than five weeks until the accounts in the stock market investors rejoice in the light of the forthcoming Endjahres-Rally already hands .
Nevertheless , the experts can produce no safe forecasts .
Banif believes that  purely statistically speaking , the month of December on the stock market normally goes hand in hand with a positive developments
Nevertheless , it is not advisable to forecasts in the short term , and only on the basis of statistics to be drawn up , especially if the current market determine serious tensions
Although other experts not approve such a strong Kursanstieg in the last few weeks of the year , this nevertheless note that the liquidity of the market and market operators will  the quoted by the given and invest because of the lack of safe action funds held by mainly in pension funds , which is affected by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend towards profitable assets .
Consequently , the stock exchange according to experts will have a rather more lateralen , influenced by fluctuations Kurstrend ,  above all because we are not even able to assess the scale of the possible reduction in the cost of the Federal Reserve , some uncertainty is due mainly to the increase in the price of crude oil and the risk of the rise in inflation. ``
Javier Barrio , Chairman of the Verkaufsabteilung in BPI in Spain , agrees that it is a risky time to announce a forthcoming market-Rally .
The opportunities  `` are not very well , the expert insured .
The Spanish Aktienindex Ibex has already lost since its record on 8 November 15.945,7 points of a value of 4 % .
But not all the experts share the same negative opinion .
In the opinion of Juan Solana , analyst in Intermoney , Ibex 35 as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional , every year , around this time , reimbursement of pension funds could be made to successfully conclude this year with almost 16 000 points .
Nevertheless , the expert stresses that this year could develop things somewhat differently ; above all because of the already in the second week , and therefore directly after the Brückentag on the day of the Constitution , Endjahres-Rally taking place .
In the view of the analysts the price fluctuations would not affect the trends .
According to an estimate by Federico Olucha , the Bank analyst Inversis , the previous assessments are on the market situation on a technical level , which could lead to a derogation could soon  that emerge from the Indexwerten whose proportions varied from the consequences of the US Hypothekenmarktkrise .
The analyst is confident that this be positive .
In the selection of values which will promote the new Ibex Höchstmaßen , analysts are agreed .
Mr Solana of Intermoney affirms that this year the great values `` . ``
On the value-winners of the expert would the two banks and some Immobiliengesellschaften count  as the electricity sector when the time comes , will be too expensive. ``
Meanwhile , Federico Olucha assured by the Bank Inversis that increases go hand in hand in connection with the banking and the industrial sector .
If the Rally occurred , the Immobiliengesellschaften will benefit from it .
The ACS `` was in the last few months to Aufholkurs and we hope that other Immobiliengesellschaften as FCC Ferrovial and follow the same path of expert `` .
With regard to the increase in the consumption of periodic during the Weihnachtstage consumption will in the last half of the market .
On the other hand , the expert who believes that the technologies are also achieve positive Umsatzergebnisse , even if they are represented in the Spanish market only in small number .
Five time in seven years ,
Over the last seven years of the December was in only two cases falling Kursverläufe .
At the end of 2003 , as has the technological bubble , this led the stock exchange from their crisis and initiated at the same time , the latest real Endjahresrallye .
This year , in which the Ibex aufholte 28,17 % to 35 , was one of the December Kursanstieg 6,68 % .
Whether profitable 2008 is the fifth year in succession ( the increasing Ibex since January at 8,36 % ) and also provide Endjahresrally can be seen .

To this end , that it has given a Teddybären a name that she was today , a court in Khartoum .
For the British teacher their lawyer , which was charged in Sudan because insult of Islam , has been sentenced on Thursday evening , by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion .
The British have been accused , as long as six to seven-year pupils to have allowed to give the name of a Teddybären Mahomet , even though it is prohibits any presentation of the Islamic chaos .
It would have to be deserves contempt .
After parents had complained of pupils in the Sudanese Kultusministerium several times , was the 54-year-old Grundschullehrerin , which was in the Unity High School of Khartoum , taken up on Sunday at home and under Rule 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code of Islam accused the insult .
In fact , this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher in their calls for as long as six to seven-year pupils , select a name to the Klassenteddy .
 The children are proposing eight names , including Hassan , Abdullah and Mohamed `` , Robert Boules headmasters .
Finally , as the class votes , choose 20 of 23 children Mohammed rather than first names .
Certainly , Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Mohammed , but also and above all a in Sudan very frequent first name .
Subsequently , the children have produced a book for the class , with the photograph of the bears out and the Bildunterschrift `` my name is Mohammed `` .
The bear itself was not a shield with this name , but the problem is , quite simply , that the presentation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as insult of Islam .
One of the Muslim fellow Members that Gillian Gibbons , informed on the same school in Sudan , said that he knew it well , and they would never have done something , and they could enter a religious faith to `` I only regret that it has asked the children to vote for a name `` , its opinion , it is only a `` `` innocent mistakes .
An opinion which share a number of pupils teacher , describe this as `` very carefully and to their pupils `` `` person who never speaks in the class `` about religion .
It should be noted that the first name Mohammed is , at the same time , the second most in Great Britain 's Zweitname exist for the 14 different Schreibweisen in English .
This often by Muslim families selected forename is regarded as a sort of the prophet ( it is often given the Erstgeborenen a family ) .
But , as the rules with regard to the use of this Vornamens be ?
Should we , for example , give him a toy ?
This is , of course , a question of interpretation .

What is the best insurance for me ?
The motor vehicle insurance covering a potential disaster caused by drivers , wiederrum contains a high cost , whose level of various factors , etc. , depends , among other things , of their age , sex , the drawing up of the driving licence , marital or family status , the nature of the insured cars and its use ,
To have a car is only the beginning .
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate motor vehicle insurance as the right Fahrzeugmodell .
First of all , there must be a clear that what we are dealing with here .
A mine is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholders .
This agreement will be written by means of a contract , which is to establish that society will the agreed Versicherungsprämie and committed in return to submit the appropriate Abfindungssumme when a disaster .
The Versicherungsprämie is the cost of insurance , which is made up by several factors , including their age , sex , the drawing up of the driving licence , marital or family status , type of vehicle insured or use .
The insurance companies are setting their prices in line with the statistics , so that higher contributions are also due to a higher risk of accidents .
For this reason , must both on 25-year-old children and women less contributions , because statistics show that these groups with a smaller accident rate , thanks to their caution .
The same also applies for married people , since these are , according to the statistical values and therefore also convinced that the companies to fewer accidents as Alleinstehende .
The benefits which is attached to the vehicle , affect the frequency and hence also the probability of an accident .
The more the use , the more likely the damage .
In the drafting of the insurance premium a whole series of points must be taken into account .
For this reason , the driver must study the situation carefully , precisely in order to select the mine that responds to his personal needs .
At this point we statistics now are the most important points which we should learn in the selection of insurance , in order to be able to not only efficient but also a make price-oriented choice .
The 25-year-olds to take on the choice of cheap insurance to many obstacles , such as , for example , the poor and the young ``  driving licence .
Even if it would be an ideal cover for the best to conclude a Vollkaskoversicherung , however , there are cheaper alternatives .
The tentative drivers can select Vollkasko with an exemption , so that the benefits of a Vollkaskoversicherung be covered , but offered at a low price .
This type of treaty means that the consumer has to pay a part of the damage incurred by the amount .
`` The amount will be set before the end of the Treaty and on the basis of the amount of Versicherungsprämie and it is the smaller the `` higher to bezahlende sum , Luis Noguera , main exponents of Spain in First declared Europe , a Vermittlungsunternehmen for online insurance .
The other option is the enlarged insurance , the insured against external Unfallschäden customers , but not on their own car incurred damage .
Furthermore , it would cover this type of insurance theft , fire and Fahrzeugverlust .
There is a Council .
If you are under 25 years old , it is in your hands , to reduce the costs of insurance ; increase your credit advice by versuchst to drive carefully and to prevent accidents .
A credit advice is a reduction in the basic standard tariff in the insurance company .
On the contrary , a Strafzahlung implies an increase in the tariff will be applied .
The amount `` credits and total penalty depends on the society and their returns .
If the company has a good year behind it , it can `` allow itself to increase the no-payment Noguera , explained .
As soon as the 25-year-threshold is exceeded , it is easier to conclude a treaty for the drivers . Reason for this is the fact that the accident rate is falling , with growing driving .
It is therefore best to opt for a Vollkaskoversicherung with excesses .
Normally vote `` young people can derive any benefit from their experience , both `` in the event of an accident and not at the time of the well explained to the Spanish Vorsteher of European company , and adds that the majority of accidents in the second Praxisjahr after the  fear of Anfängers `` has been given .
Nevertheless , it is possible for a married customers , which is not to conclude children , better , a Vollkaskoversicherung ; of course , it is only the financial situation of the person in question .
From the insurers are married couples with children as customers , with the lowest accident rate , and correspondingly low for their contributions .
In this case , with an exemption would be Vollkaskoversicherung ( with an amount to EUR 300 ) , the best option , in the event that it has received a high credit advice , an enlarged insurance , which is only the third Fahrzeugjahr recommends .
As a whole more relaxed `` you go and have a greater purchasing power , the `` it allows them to a higher contributions , notes Luis Noguera .
For pensioners , it is with a Vollkaskoversicherung exemption ( ) in order to a sum of EUR 150 , or conclude an enlarged insurance , which uses only when a sufficiently high credit advice .
In the end , it is necessary to point out that the mine something very important , not only because it protects the driver Unfallschäden against potential , but also because it entails high costs , making it necessary that a thorough choice is made , which is in line with our personal situation .

Kartenhaie
Is the American Kreditkrise Kreditkartenmarkt ?
If blood is in the water , it is only natural that Rückenflossen herumwirbeln wildly .
Where America now that we have the predators have the Kreditkartenmarkt of the country in the sights .
Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect the could achieve Kreditkartenverluste 99 billion dollars , if the risk of infection spreading of under-funded loans to other forms of Verbrauchenkrediten .
Signs of the tension are obvious .
There are increases in both the Ausbuchungen Säumnisraten as well , which are measuring the percentage of loans , the late each einziehbar or not more than 30 days .
The HSBC has announced last month , that it has a 1.4 billion dollars taken from their American Verbraucherfinanzierungen charging , partly because of the weakness of Kreditkartennehmern .
It is still too early to indulge in panic .
Losses and Säumnisse are still low .
According to the Ratingagentur Moody the Drittquartals-Säumnissrate of 3.89 % was almost a full percentage point under the historical average .
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors .
A change in the American Privatinsolvenzrechtsgesetzen in 2005 has led to a dramatic case of Konkursanmeldungen , once again for the ( account for a large part of the Keditkartenverluste ; the number of applications and thus Säumnisgebühren ) would rise again whether the general conditions for the worse borrowers or not .
The industry also reports of solid Zahlungsraten , which show how much of their debts consumers every month abbezahlen
And confidence in credit karten-based securities is quite strong , despite the standstill in other corners of the structured funding .
Dennis Moroney the TowerGroup , a research companies , expects the Ausgabemengen will be for 2007 at the end of the day , 25 % higher than last year .
Direct Infektionskanäle between the Immobilienkreditkrise and the Kreditkartenmarkt there is undoubtedly : it is more likely that consumers include Kreditkartenschulden , now that Eigenheimkredite dry up .
But the issuers will look at the Geldfluss Kapitalwerte , therefore , not necessarily solve Hauspreise falling from a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers .
They can even be for the issuers of advantage .
The incentives for falling consumer to pay Hypothekenraten , if the buildings are less value than the value of the loan ; as a result of the Kartenschulden Rückzahlungsprioritäten amongst the more important .
Issuers will also be able to react more quickly and much more flexible than the lender stürmischeren conditions by interest rates or Kreditgrenzen change .
This should , in theory , reduce the risk of a rapid re-evaluation of the assets .
`` We will not wake up one day and assess the loans completely new ' , Gary Perlin says , Ones Hauptfinanzreferent plans .
Even if a sudden Unterdeckungskrise Kreditkartenmarkt is unlikely to the risks of a sustainable slowdown are real .
If lower Hauspreise Kreditminderung America and a push the recession , the industry will certainly face a grimmigeren future .
They continue to keep looking for these fins of sharks .

Banks crisis want to overcome
The American Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain , Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets .
So more than USD 100 billion will come through auctions on the Währungsmärkte .
In these auctions banks interest rates to which they are prepared to lend money auction each other .
For example , the US Fed sends USD 40 billion at auction , further 24 they blithely makes for the European and the Swiss Central Bank .
It is 11.September after the attacks of the first time that the central banks in the individual Member States agree on such a coordinated approach or to alleviate the effects of a crisis .
This step is to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy , in other words , the increasing lack of free verfügbarem capital which give the banks ' for its customers Bernard Baumohl wrote in a report by the consultancy firm Economic Outlook Group .
'The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 % to around 50 % , ' Baumohl added in his report .
The banks have not already bedienter loans for 60 billion dollars lost , especially in the United States .
Further deplored analysts expect .
'The central banks must have had really afraid of what more can do everything , as decided on this approach , `` said the head economist of ABN Amro , Kieran Davies .
'It is that the situation is really bad , ' he said .
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans , for their customers loans more expensive .
This would reduce the consumption and plunge the American economy in recession , possibly with the impact on the economic growth of the entire world .
The central banks have decided , after it has not succeeded in reducing them , the so-called LIBOR , the London Interbankzinssatz , which is used in the Geldverleih between banks .
This means that the banks have constantly fear , to lend money to each other , despite the fact that the central banks in the USA , Canada and the United Kingdom have reduced its interest rates on several occasions during the autumn .
'The will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates , ' Greg Salvaggio said of the Tempus programme the Reuters Consulting .
A few analysts are of the opinion that this step of the central banks Aufheizung contributes to the crisis , because it does not solve the basic problem , and it is the case of Immobilienmarktes in the United States .

Klaus : debates , the ecologists is quite incredible
Global climate change supposedly harm most developing countries .
President Vaclav Klaus once again to the problem of global warming .
The criticism referred to the coming to an end the UN international conference on climate change in Bali .
In Vienna , where he presented his book 'A blue , green planet , ' he said that the debates of the ecologists are quite incredible .
Klaus , not only the structure of the Conference is unacceptable , a strange mixture of government representatives of non-governmental organisations and such forms , but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric which it has , and the reality of the situation .
'The debate is unstrukturiert , it is a Wortfeuerwerk , this is only a substitute for a real solution to the current problems , `` said Klaus .
The Czech President emphasised in the presentation of his book that this issue is very important to him and that he is committed to this .
It is also expressed its satisfaction that his book appear in the German translation , because I am often 'cartoons of my views ' .
Now unverzerrt interested parties could read its attitude .
Klaus reminded us that he is not a Klimatologe , but he was , in his opinion , adequate conditions , to write a book about this .
He was ultimately academics , able to understand and to assess the technical pamphlets , have experience of statistics and was also economist .
The main thrust of the book he described the theory that the climate is constantly changing and that it is therefore quite natural that it to global warming , no consensus view among researchers that the consequences of the current changes are not to be too large and seriously and therefore no threat , and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate , superfluous , ineffective and unacceptable expensive .
In addition , he think it as someone who experience with totalitarian Sytemen have to impose unacceptable for other unproven views , to see this as a dangerous restriction of freedom .
On issues of repeated here , he said that he was not against 'a reasonable protection , but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between costs and yield . '

`` We have to take care that we do not also underpins social upheaval and delivering in violence .
We have to take this seriously , 'he said the published in Hanover ' new press ' .
Not every young person rightly come with the rapid change in the social reality .
Union , countries and communities already worked with vigour , reduce problems , said Schäuble .
This concerns not only the integration of migrants .

Holiday season are not
In Hungary so that the practice of Umdisponierens of working days has become established around the Christmas holidays are regulated by law in the meantime , however , the coming year shows us less these days .
Also in the EU and in America something else we understand by 'holiday ' .
The Hungarian legal system to distinguish between Staatsfeiertagen and labour-free days .
Arbeitsfreie days are mostly church holidays or are with major historic events in context .
For example , we are celebrating New Year : both the last day of the old , as well as from the first day of the new year are labour-free days - the latter alone , so that the New Year 's Eve-Feiernden sit .
Throughout the year , we have a total of fourteen holidays .
The Staatsfeiertage are the 15 March , which is reminiscent of the 1848 revolution , and of 23 October , the day of the revolution of 1956 .
On 20 August is the formation of a state , on 1 May , the work celebrated , on 1 and 2 November we remember our deaths .
In addition , there are two holidays to Easter , Pfingsten and Christmas .
Since our Heads of State , national or religious holidays are rarely on a weekend , the practice of 'working day-postponement ' has proved its worth in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday just one day .
The price of extended weekends is , however , that we have to work against the Samstagen very well , or go to school .
When this day , before or after the holiday , should be dealt with at the end of the day , will be set by the ministers for many years in a regulation of our own .
The legislation applies to all employers and employees , for public equally employees and officials of the public service .
With the exception of companies and institutions , in which the operation without interruption , will continue in the holidays , are only .
This is the only by working order at the end of the year the holidays rather confused , from 24 December , life will formally here at home , because most of the days Zeitausgleich between Christmas and New Year 's Eve , or has been abolished for holidays .
In the next year , more holidays in the Wochenmitte , or at the end of the week , so that there will be less Umdisponierungen during the days when this year .
The calendar will first of all around the day of work 'to ' , so that people can remain the same four days in a row at home .
Saturday , 26 April will be a working day , so that the Friday , 2 May will be a day of rest .
The second re-planning is connected with the holiday on 23 October , on Saturday , 18 October , we will have to the Friday 24 October through beforehand .
The end of the year , however , will be completely in the sign of holidays , are all from 24 December , and are even if New Year 's Eve falls on a Wednesday .

Is the vicious Venus Zwilling the world
Is the Venus , despite their live the earth 's atmosphere hostile similar thought than we have up to now : the European spacecraft 'Venus Express ' has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and Windwirbel in Poland , as they appear in the winter , also on the planet .
For almost three decades of scientists suggest that it blitzt on Venus .
Now the European probe 'Venus Express has shown - they sensed electromagnetic waves on the fringes of the atmosphere : the lightning Venus shoot at a level of around 56 kilometres of cloud to cloud , Christopher Russell reported by the University of California in Los Angeles in scientific magazine ' Nature ' .
According to the famous ' Ursuppen theory 'lightning arise life on earth have : storm should suggested in the ocean reactions which have led to the formation of amino acids , the building blocks of life .
Not so on Venus : 'If there has ever been life there , it must be in the very early history ' , Sean Solomon Carnegie declared by the institution in Washington .
Today , the atmosphere is around a hundred times more heavily than in the world should be there on the surface of the Venus barely alive : there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees .
'The Venus is perhaps the Teufelszwilling throughout the world , but it is a Zwilling ' Russell said .
Why is the Venus , the earth in mass and size is a similar has taken such a completely different development , is the fundamental issue of the Esa-mission .
The launch of 'Venus Express ' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus-research , as was not probe since the beginning of the 1990s , specifically in the field of research into more of this planet .
The latest research which will be presented in a number of 'Nature ' -Artikeln , underline the researchers are not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system .
'you also show that we have in common with our Nachbarplaneten are greater than the world 's first adopted ' , shares the Esa .
The researchers in addition to the already well-known in the North Pole there have also been a whirlwind Wolkenstrudel on Südpol , is much more quickly .
The phenomenon is reminiscent of Luftströme on the abasing worldly Winterhemisphäre , writes a research team Piccioni by the Italian process by Giuseppe Di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica .
The second central planet the solar system has virtually the same as the earth and there is in diameter 12.100 kilometres almost as .
The planet Abendstern Morgen- or as described in less than five days ago under the sun .
It is , however , much slower themselves : a Venustag takes 243 Erdentage .
Although the Venus with Oberflächentemperaturen 460 degrees and a pressure from 92 reminds cash in the earth , researchers claim that both planet have arisen in very similar circumstances .
On both water collected , at the same time , in the oceans of the world , but on Venus was lost in the space .
And while carbon dioxide in Karbonatgesteinen fixated on the planet , from Venus it makes on the majority of the atmosphere .

Small Saarland , good education
Is the smallest province of vocational training is a leader and even with the international orientation of its universities .
Only in a Bildungsfeld the Saarländer expresses the same deficit as the rest of the country .
'I have heeded said yesterday on the 50th anniversary a Nichtsaarländer that we are not French ' - this slogan plakatiert even the smallest province of irony on his 50th birthday .
In France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarlands , it is in the Bildungsmonitor of the Institute of the German economy Cologne ( IW ) to place five .
The universities from tradition cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries .
The university in 1948 Saarbrücken was set up by the French .

Accordingly , the proportion of foreign students with 15.6 per cent .
But also the Landeskinder the Saar in on average number of universities - many of them without a conclusion on secondary school .
'In the Saar making use of the professional education ' Axel Plünnecke , the Bildungsexperte IW says .
More than one in five young people buys his Studienberechtigung from a vocational school , so that the Saar is more than seven points above the Bundesdurchschnitt .
The combinations of vocational and academic training are developed comparatively strong .
In terms of the population with dual courses for the equipment is the second-best in Germany .
In spite of the practical training and rising demand the number of Ingenieurabsolventen has fallen in recent years , however , by a third .
That is why the Ministry of Education saarländische has committed universities now to a Marketingkampagne engineering for scientific subjects .
'On the generally-building schools we have initiated after the first PISA study a number of reforms ' , says a spokesperson for the Bildungsministeriums .
So the government a comparative tests nationwide .

Whether improve the performance of the pupils , will only be replaced in the future .
In 2003 , the proportion of the Pisa Risikoschüler fell from 29 to 20 % .
Overall , the Saar whipped up but not as strong as other Member States .
Count the Bavaria better .
And the anger of the Pisa Saarländer Fremdsprachenkenntnise in not be measured - otherwise score in this area .
Because the language of our neighbours in secondary schools duty - even if the Saarländer are not French .

However , one aspect of dämpfte his delight : `` That is precisely what is being violated ; not that we are a higher rate of growth , but that we had fewer losses `` , he stated .
He stressed that they have fallen in spite of the weak market `` not too deep. ``
Station Telecinco ended yesterday the day with a surplus of EUR 2.54 % .
These profits has detracted from the previous year 's losses on 15,66 % .
According to information from the Firmenwert and now reached the 4.488,88 million , although the bulk of capital ( Mediaset 52 % ) monitored , and only Vocento is involved with 13 % .
The rival Antena 3 lost 1,52 yesterday and has since January percentage points to a total loss of a 40.5 % so that its market value is with 2.193,46 million by half .
The market value of other Kommunikations companies quoted on the other hand , is rising ; in the case of Sogecable on 3.571 million in Prisa ( editor of the newspaper Cinco Díaz 2.518,53 million ) and Vocento on 1.779 million .
The comparison with Antena 3 is `` stem from the fact that it is `` two similar companies , Vasile .
Uncertain still seems the question of to what extent we can actually operate eliminating technically , at what price and how we organise it on Kundenebene lucrative .
A week ago , station Telecinco stated its intention to forge ahead with this year is the first television more than 1 000 million from advertising revenue Bruttogewinnen . This assured Mr Tringali , the managers of Publiespaña station Telecinco and the advertising companies in the group .

The essential factor for the compared with better Börsenverlauf of station Telecinco see the analysts the high Payout-statehood in which the company could have until now : the 2006 led by Alejandro Echevarría companies chaired a 100 % Dividendenausschüttung .
Vasile assured , however , that the reason that could after the purchase of 33 % of the shares of Endemol , with the parent company Mediaset vary , even if it is for an official announcement too early .
We are committed to the official `` compromise that at least 50 % of the shares , even if we have always been given much more than that .
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year , the value of shares , we have been able , by the purchase of 33 % of the Endemol-shares increase .
According to the analysts the market is currently certain Verlusttendenzen .
Recently Lehmann Brothers reduced its Profitkalkulation in station Telecinco for this year by 4 % and for 2009 by 7 % .
This is the result of the reduction of the projected growth , which will fall from 10.5 % in 2008 and 2009 to 8.4 % of 5.5 % to 5.1 % .
This also has the prospect of reduced Gewinnberechnung Antena 3 for 2008 and 2009 by 4.5 % to 7.5 % .

The climate of Venus could see a glimpse of the future of the earth can
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live , scientists have said yesterday .
Data into orbit of European Raumschiffes show that the planet is a abgewandten Zwilling the world even more than was deliberately so far .
The Venus is the näheste planetarische neighbour of the planet .
The two worlds have approximately the same size and have similar Planetenbahnen , however , the Venus the sun is in a little more detail .
Billions of years before the Venus prevailed conditions , which would have been very similar to those in the world and could even be habitable , scientists believe today .
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect , the erosion of the atmosphere with the sun and slower Rotationstempo Venus followed a very different Entwicklungskurs .
Today the planet is deprived of water and has an annual average surface temperature to melt , which is heiss enough , lead and has been devastated by hurricane-strong winds and Blitzstürmen .
The findings of the spacecraft Venus Express the European Space Agency , which has examined the planet for one year , offer a sobering look at how the earth could develop in view of the disastrous effects of climate change .
Professor Fred Taylor of the department of physics Oxford University , one of the head of the mission Venus Express , said : 'It is clear why the climate of Venus is so different to the earth , while the planet are very similar otherwise ' .
'Our new data , it will be possible to devise a scenario in which the Venus began billion of years as the earth , possibly with a bewohnbarer environment ' .

Test Peugeot 207 SW 1 ( 6 ) VTi : Voruteile dwindling
To tell the truth , I have never been a particular fan of the Peugeot 206 .
His Fahreigenschaften were not worth very much , the quality of Gangschaltung , the control and processing could be termed rather below average .
Now , however , his successor , is the Peugeot 207 , on the market , and which is much better .
With the name of the Kombi SW is still a bit , and it only remains for me to change my mind .
When I had the classic Hatchback tested the 207 , I had to complain about me , for example , about the low Kopffreiheit on the Hintersitzen .
These complaints , there is now no longer , because if the Kombi is designed in such a way that not even Zweimetermänner .
Further to quickly
I shall go through the interior decorating only briefly in order not to repeat myself .
It is a rather successful design , where I have only because of the meagre Mitteltunnels objections .
I would welcome a little more designerische design , where the car is otherwise such an elegant impression .
The seats are convenient , and over the times are , where we may be a line no longer exists , or to brief seats .
Also the Seitenhalt has been substantially improved 206 .
With regard to the space , we can also feel the compounded here the dimensions .
The Kombi , which I mentioned earlier , the lack of Kopffreiheit is also removed .
In the boot suitcase
The most important thing in this car is but the Laderaum .
( I must also because of the aufklappbaren Rückfensters ) as a very good and describe beladbar platzsparend .
The Hohlräume are equipped with Haltegurten , which constitute a perfect compromise .
They do not disrupt , I consider it apart and also more severe objects .
But we have been talking about the Ladevolumen .
It is according to the table in the basic 428 litre , which is a more competition in relation to the average value .
We do not , however , in comparison with the best selling car in the Czech Republic , this category , the Skoda Fabia Combi .
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav , we see that Peugeot falls to show signs of 52 litre .
For a Auslandsurlaub or the Einladen Kinderwagens of this value is already critical .
But I would like to emphasise the Positiva , I must mention the following the belt Umklappen the very shallow Laderaum or even the very low Ladekante .
120 PS in four ranks
Our Testwagen was equipped with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor included 1.6 litres and with an output of 88 KW .
And , quite frankly , a 1 600-Kubik-engine should take the drives a families-Hatchback .
He is quiet , has a low consumption and is well away .
If I compare this with his counterpart in Skoda that works sometimes as would be a vehicle exhaust pipe Lappen , then I can only be enthusiastic about it .
The price speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly volkstümlich .
We must remember , however , that we have tested a well-funded car with a geräumigen Innneren and a very good driving force .
The basic price of cars with the 1400er Benzinmotor of SEK 329900 is .
With our driving force it costs SEK from 410900 , which is already quite a lot .
The funding of the premium Testwagens proposes once again with an extra SEK 80000 annually .
We had however Kopfairbags , automatic air-conditioning , automatic Scheibenwischerauslösung , electrical Fensterheber and and ...
So the car is costing a total of SEK 531900 simple .
That is a lot , but you calculate the increase of a Fabia and you will arrive in a very similar amount .
Therefore , all that remains is the decision as to which we want to choose brand .

The Popular 200 of credit institutions on Monday to Friday 12 hours a day have opened up .
Popular , has decided that a large part of its branches to modernise .
A total of 200 of them are located in the economically most regions of Spain .
For the Institute , which operates under the brand name Popular Max , these branches , represent a major milestone .
But also the rest of the Spanish institutions , as the first Popular banking group is the leap for daring to extend the opening hours until its subsidiaries weekdays 20.30h on Saturdays and taken up by 10h 20.30h .
The banking group BBVA which also said lies the extension of its opening hours in the branches repeatedly , has taken thus far , there has been no definitive decision .
The current negotiations with the trade unions , the Bank seem to be an agreement , be closed in the 75 % of all branches on Saturdays and open up a day for this afternoon , if not for the customers .
Whether further banks to join the new initiative , which is the Geschäftsöffnungszeiten will depend on the empirical values of the Popular bank .
And this is precisely the intention of the Popular with its project .
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which , because of their situation , the independent kauflustige customers , small and medium-size enterprises , but also the large supermarkets to grasp .
The bank would open up the new 200 offices in the course of the coming 18 months , since it is not new , but modified opening hours .
To this end , the bank will alter the premises of those branches who are already in Geschäftszonen , and at the same time bringing them into line with the individual Kundenprofil of the different areas .
The enlargement of the opening hours is linked to a new Raumgestaltung of branches , characterised by a more up-to-date , farbenfroheres design .
The competent Bankvertreter Ángel Rivera assured that the restructuring does not require greater investment , but with an increased recruitment accompanied , since a subsidiary needed now more not six , but eight or nine employees .
The branches , which will be even with additional premises for SMEs , will be able to sell no financial products .
A positive experience for the group
His approach Popular , has already been tried out nine branches in Madrid .

Richard Gere is simply not enough cynical
'The Hunting Party ' and 'Mörderischer peace ' two films deal with the war in the Balkans .
But both are not convincing .
Either the ideas put too much on Action and Geballer or sentimental but they are .
Since Richard Gere in 'The Hunting Party can not ' help .
The good news first : it is true that the war criminals hide Karadzic and Mladic are still in the mountains of the Balkans , but it is there , in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war , now the actors Richard Gere has been found .
We had lost the most beautiful man of the 1980s least , because too many nice-irrelevant roles in Wohlfühlfilmen for women and too many press conferences on the subject of austrieben Buddhism , the desire for inspection .
Now all of a sudden , Richard Gere is the most important argument , The Hunting Party - if the hunters will 'Gejagten ' ( Why must always be those actually so long and confusing as driver-collective agreements ? ) perhaps look at .
It provides a wonderfully augenzwinkernde presentation : basically , be Kriegsreporter Simon Hunt is what has become of Gere if the destiny and the cinematographic sector would not be so gnädig : a man who has its very best for long periods , but as a monument to preserve its decline ruinen the same considerable vestiges of the former charm .
However , despite this Trumpfes The Hunting Party is ' , together with the German production 'Mörderischer peace ' , which is also , this week , only the endless series of failed Balkans war-films .
With 'Mörderischer peace ' we can make short process : the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo ( Adrian Topol , Max Riemelt ) , a Serbin before Kosovar Heckenschützen save what a love promptly in it .
Although it is a good thing that the Serbs are not only as the root of all evil , the fernsehflache film loses itself too quickly into Geballer and Action .
It is a kind of 'to sound the alarm for Cobra 11 ' without motorway but with war .
On the other hand , research is to 'The Hunting Party ' is an example of why there has never actually been a true good Balkan Kriegsfilm .
The history of three US Kriegsreportern which seek to open the Serbian Oberkriegsverbrecher 'of the fox ' , with another director and another Drehbuchautor ( both in one Richard Shepard ) can at a different time perhaps a new 'Apocalypse Now ' .
Because the stories are indeed striking : both times are small team in the forest , in order to achieve something which the military can not and on both occasions there will be a trip to the madness .
One of the reasons for the failure of 'The Hunting Party ' is that we do not simply Simon Hunt the cynics can be run with heart when he will be presented to us at the beginning .
No , it must also Script andichten him a romantic affair , with a later Muslim Bosnierin murdered .
Ultimately 'The Hunting Party ' then sold down the river , catch if the reporters within the last five minutes Zeitrafferverfahren succeed in what NATO , CIA Kopfgeldjäger and all the world have not achieved in five years : the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge .
This is so bad that we want to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik .
The film has a very human concerns .
It intends to denounce that Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic still rumlaufen freely , and he suspected of the Americans and the French ( here they are meant to be an exception and sometimes agreed ) to promote the persecution on the grounds of secret political agreements not too .
But the good and evil Gemeinte are sometimes so similar to that is a famous Brecht-poem .
It says on the Holzmaske an Asian Dämons on the Arbeitstisch the poet : 'Mitfühlend I see the geschwollenen Stirnadern , andeutend : how demanding it is to be a bad ' .
Films as ' The Hunting Party 'have to be precisely for such Schwellköpfe which indicate but , as it is demanding .
The problem is not limited to the Genre of Balkankriegsfilms .
Recently , that all Iraq Hollywoods films were great Flops has been in this newspaper report .
We can add : there has never been a good South Africa film .
Almost always applies : if a Star driving around on the trouble spots or minefields the world , then something is out , such as `` Rangoon dismisses ' with Patricia Arquette 'Jenseits all frontiers with Angelina Jolie or ' blood diamonds ' with Leonardo DiCaprio .
It may be that all the conflicts are simply time to close .
It has taken after decades before Hollywood could go with 'Schindlers list ' a good film on the Holocaust .
Some film is mature may still be in force - the now as a classic Vietnam works ' The Deer Hunter ' , ' Apocalypse Now 'or ' full Metal jacket 'celebrated at the time are masterpieces as unanimously .
But perhaps we know today , where everyone is mass murder in real time on two screens at home also quite simply too much about the conflicts in the world .
And this is undermining the Drehbuchschreibern the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs to tell good stories .
'continued existence , or otherwise , of ' or 'The great dictator ' of course have become so much is because Lubitsch and still Chaplin did not know how serious the Nazi regime was genuinely .
Perhaps we should not want to be good , if we want to make good films .
Perhaps we must have the sarcasm Künstlerblick distancing of Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk .
As has been consulted on the parallels between its historical novel 'Lemprières dictionary ' and the Balkan conflict , he said : 'It is only that there are a number of things which never change .
Cities will always be terribly dangerous , people are being murdered in horrifying way and there will be always war in Yugoslavia ' .

Attack department ,
In the debate of the republican Youtube the two presidential candidates favourites Rudy Giuliani Mitt Romney and provide a harsh blows fear - and now have a Außenseiterkandidaten .
The strain of the candidates to delivering the first issue .
He has made a New York 'sanctuary for illegal immigrants ' Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani .
This in turn kontert with serious allegations : 'I would say , its own house was a port to illegal immigrants ' You 've Giuliani , accusing the former governor of Massachusetts to have private immigrants without papers .
The upshot of the candidates to attack : because the Republican basis still has no clear favourites , the eight Präsidentschaftsanwärter use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents .
The rolling 30 seconds cassettes , via the Internet users have eingesandt Youtube , are little more than Stichwortgeber .
'With this type of isolationism , we have come to power Hitler ' , John accuses McCain his opponent Ron Paul , the only one in the Round calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq .
This is also the veterans Romney Vietnam really have read , when he refuses , the so-called ' ‘ water boarding ’ ' , a Verhörmethode simuliert in Ertränken , rather than condemning torture .
That is the major issues of the campaign , but now on the other side of war in Iraq and Folterdebatten demonstrate the reactions of the Saalpublikums in St Petersburg in Floridas .
Whenever conservative values and rejected for future tax increases in the audience Applause on brandet .
This shows once again , where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie .
'I have made a mistake me at the time , declared Romney zerknirscht and in Abbitte Fernsehpublikum basis and to ensure that , in 1994 , he was still the Abtreibungsbefürwortern .
On the other hand , is Giuliani foundering , as he will be asked for its opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible .

Hungarian Fodor and the six percentage points
As Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor presentation , the meeting of experts on Tuesday at the end , and the debate on the international climate regime post-2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening .
Experts and politicians discuss from 192 countries on the road map of Bali , in which the emissionsreduzierenden measures are laid down for the period after 2012 , after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol .
At the moment , a heated debate between industrialised countries and developing countries is in progress .
The United States have already announced that they want to have concrete figures not negotiate , but it would be prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels by 25-40 % .
The other major question the Conference is whether the industrialised countries are ready , apart from the reduction of emissions in the developing countries , both financially and to support technologically .
It has also been reached an agreement on the support of developing countries .
The Kyoto Protocol has insinuated adjustment fund should be managed by a 16-köpfigen Council , probably in the Global Environmental Facility ( GEF ) of the UN , as in the 'Piac is recorded és profit ' .
Six per cent of Hungary
The Environment Gábor Fodor supported on behalf of Hungary , the commitment of the EU to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures , and to achieve a new international agreement until 2009 .
The Minister has stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 ( 20 % compared to 1990 ) , irrespective of whether the 'agreement after 2012 will ' made successful or not , and even the European Union would be prepared to commit itself to a 30 % reduction soferne other large industrialized countries of the world , or developing countries are also prepared to comply with their obligations and responsibly .
Gábor Fodor emphasised that the objective of the Member States that have joined in 1997 , the Kyoto Protocol was a reduction of only 5.2 % , whereas the EU had with their then 15 Member States already to a minus by 8 % .
The target for Hungary is the reduction of greenhouse gases by 6 % compared to the years of 1985-87 - a figure that will meet the country , as is widely reported in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment .
The stakes are high in Bali - which , after all , is the long-term international climate policy agreement has to be completed within two years , otherwise it would certainly only after 2012 would enter into force , and in this case the Kyoto Protocol Reduktionsvorhaben not renewed , international Emissionsreduktionssystem , also stressed the importance of the IPCC , the international climate change by the Nobel Peace Prize excellent scientific Committee of the UN in its recent report .
This would delay the emission levels , and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable , which according to the Wissenschaftern extremely serious and irreparable consequences .

The development of the Bulgarian Immobilienmarktes is so pleasant - the whole of Europe is looking carefully at the rarely mentioned earlier the Balkan nations .
What , where , and who still buy the cheapest market in the EU , but rapidly more expensive ?

There is no doubt that Bulgaria is currently the most sought-plaster for Immobilienkäufe in Eastern European area , with favourable Skiappartements and homes at sea .
Between the mountain regions Bansko , Borovec , Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular , on sea Albena , the 'Goldküste `` , the '' Sonnenküste ' , and the historic Städtchen Sozopol and Nessebar the stars , however , property and around Kavarna Balcik are also more and more .
According to estimates by re-Max analysts in Bulgaria the interior wid sooner or later also attract investors , for example , Veliko Tarnovo , Gabrovo , Elena , and Triavna , and also the very favourable region of Russian recorded more buyers .
The capital Sofia also offers offer attractive services , trade and space for offices and meeting rooms high returns .
Bulgaria is well on the way to be one of the most attractive European Golferparadiese , and therefore attract alongside the summer and winter tourist season is also in the other two seasons tourists .
Buy a forward-looking investors , therefore , already large-scale , for example around Bansko .
Analysts , people who want to buy property in Bulgaria , a change of their Lebenswandels .
Most of the buyer are British , but there are also interested parties from France , Belgium , Spain , and more and more from Romania .
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present , while there are in the Black Sea and the ski resorts mainly Russian buyers .
There are three groups of foreign buyers Georgi Jankov , Regionaldirektor of re-Max Bulgaria says .
Those who want to buy property revitalisierte either 50-EUR 100 000 , or an houses 5-EUR 15 000 , which they then renovate itself .
Good links and access and communications are important , but also the proximity to a city , shops and doctors are crucial for the consumer .
The second category of those who are seeking a Feriendomizil belong ( Bulgaria was listed in December among the top Ten destinations of Germans ) .
The third group from businessmen who invest with the aim of a mid- to long-term added value .
However , property in the capital , will be more expensive to date , due to the ever-increasing demand .
Within the EU , the property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria , over the last five years there has been an increase in prices but 21 % per year .
The rise in the real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries .

The founding fathers of the Krautrock return
The German Supergruppe musiziert Siebziger : the three Bandmitglieder of Harmonia before their Konsolen themselves in a concert in Berlin .
To its great Mitschnitt Revival a time 'Live seems to 1974 ' .
Even then , they were much famous abroad .
Seeking sensation occurred in the form of three gesetzter gentlemen in the Abendtafel .
Everyone has to be boxes , its cable and , above all , his Knöpfe .
In Mr Dieter Moebius thront blüten white shirt with 63 years in the middle .
The left accompanied by Michael Rother , 57 years in possession of young and laptop and Gitarre .
Justice , regarded by the audience , is krümmt Hans-Joachim Roedelius , 73 , concentrated in the Konsole .
Everyone contributes noise , sometimes even a Beat .
And sometimes it is accidentally to a traditional piece of music .
Then it seems not to disturb the gentlemen itself .
That the bond musiziert Harmonia again , has been under Krautrock-Liebhabern for some excitement .
But we must condemn here : targeted enquiries revealed that , although the name schwirrte through collective Popgedächtnis , but not to miss this band for 32 years .
But why should not also the German his living myths from the seventies should celebrate ?
Because what is misleading Krautrock , in England and America has always been more than in their own country .
As the Musikwirtschaft gave the survivors of the Cologne group Can 2003 echo-price for the work that we saw in the Chamber in fragende German Popgesichter .
As the Red Chili Peppers trying in the hymn of praise on the band La Düsseldorf and New , bedankten knew that the surprise no borders .
In concerts Michael Rother hockte later in the Red Chili Peppers trying on the stage as an old mate .
The problem of the ignorance at home and the 'naïve optimism on this point in the foreigners is one thing .
The memory is therefore overwhelmed with Harmonia because the trio exist only two years and during that time Wirkungsmacht also develop a far lower than that of other was allocated to them .
Roedelius Moebius and have had with the artists Conrad previously Schnitzler under the promising musiziert on behalf of clusters .
First of all , we played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne .
Then in Düsseldorf , for economic reasons for a largely by the Church Plattenlabel .
Rother had just been helpful in providing in power station , and then as Gitarrist in New , then perhaps the most radical German group erspielt a reputation .
In 1973 Rother followed the cluster musicians in exile following forest Weserbergland .
In Old Weserhof , a heap from the sixteenth century , they lived as urban volatile Kommunarden .
Less ideological than in the town hall I , which is still had Roedelius plagen as nannies .
In spitzweghaftem Künstlerdasein .
There was also the supposedly Sperrmüll a Wimpel of Gesangsvereins Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art .
Some Harmonia laboured them .
The first Album said 'music of Harmonia ' and the 'De Luxe ' .
Because the music and modest sounded , the bond suffered material distress .
This was not only the Selbstfindung Reisigsammeln .
The now appeared CD 'Live 1974 ' was a concert in Griessem mitgeschnitten before a 50-köpfigen Rekordkulisse , as someone to recall believes .

The most expensive Auchan , Tesco , increased by almost a fifth
In the Hypermarkets Budaörser Handelsgebiet also have this year , the average increase in price of 16 % last year , with the difference that it this year no increase in VAT .
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the price of the usual Budaörser Handelsdreieck Weihnachtskorbes has the 'Napi ' also increased 16 % this year , but in all Hypermärkten prices have been recorded over 1000 HUF .
After the prices in the Lebensmittelmärkten last December 'davongaloppiert ' , which is not prozentuell rise drastically , compared with the already high , former initial level .
However , it is intended as a deterrent to the consumer that what they had paid last year far below 9 000 HUF , this year , not even for 10 , 000 HUF available .
The price of the 'Napi ' Warenkorbs exceeded the magic 10 000-HUF-border at least 91 HUF investigated in the markets .
The high price was 10.573 HUF .
( In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF . )
The price of fish were almost Unicum and living on Vorjahresniveau , greatly increased prices for Putenbrustfilets , and on the other hand , are Nuss poppy .
Prices for bread flour , and in line with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary , however , there have been Auchan 1kg Brotwecken for 139 Ft .
There was no competition-related decline in the product to below 200 Ft .
It is also surprising here two , the price of a litre of Coca-Cola Pfandflasche from 200 Ft was , therefore , including the drink deposit cost only HUF 257 .
Nevertheless , this year in the 'Napi ' Warenkorbs-comparison Auchan raised the most expensive , and Cora most favourable .
Our calculations have shown that Cora prices have in the 'Napi ' shopping basket Weihnachtspreisen last year with the 15 , while each Auchan Tesco and increased by 18 % .
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of last year and this year was the most expensive of 12 % , while the increase between billigstem shopping basket of last year and the current year teuerstem representing 21 % .
The average price rises 1.480,00 HUF was .
The average increase in the last year was still 1.206,00 Ft , however , the Mehrwertsteuererhöhung price was last Christmas .
It is precisely this process has taken the trade furiously : it would seem that the Warenhäuser could not decide what Preisspanne should apply in the individual articles , since the effects of the increase in the consumption have incalculable .
( If the dealer does the circulation of a product bad , it can fall by a substantial profits in the Preisspanne , after the Verkehrsintensität . )
Mehwertsteuer-the rise of the 'Napi ' Warenkorbes last year was so radical that the most expensive element was the value of 2006 by 1720 Ft exceeded , whereas the price difference in the cheapest merely basket 844 Ft .
This year , have not been observed such extremes , since the most expensive basket 1.630,00 Ft to cost more than in the previous year , and even the cheapest there was an increase of 1.284,00 Ft .
In comparison with the last two Weihnachtssaisons was a disastrous increase , the price of day-to-day consumer article in the Hypermärkten has risen in less than 20 months by more than 30 % .
( confirmed this once again not necessarily the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary : for some basic the Statistical Office in the period of 12 months , found a more than 30 % rise .
So in addition to flour in around in eggs . )
However , you look into the 'Napi ' shopping basket , it seems almost impossible to pursue , because the price level of last year expensive product itself has risen in the worst case , little more than 10 % .
Obviously Mehllieferanten are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - after all , they were able to pass the drastic increase in prices to the multinationals .
In the golden Handelsdreieck are n't complain ; it is constantly reported by good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three Warenhäusern do not look more on prices .
It is purchased from all large quantities , sustainable food goes on Paletten on the Ladentische .
Wednesday morning there was in all three Warenhäusern endless queues in the Kassa when the number of customers suddenly exploded .
Nevertheless , it is reported by the country a smaller Kundenfrequenz , so many multinationals in the Meinungsforschern complain that they could not even achieve the planned turnover , and not only in food , but also in sustainable consumer goods .

Political plans : Hungarian guard Staatsrisiko increased
In the view of the department for risk analysis Analysing ) ( Risk-division of political action plans in this August , with the support of the 'movement for a better Hungary ' formed Hungarian guard have increased the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects .
In the 'Risikowarnungs report ' of the Institute it means , among other things : in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk is the 'tightening up of the existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and non-Zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary , which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term .
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard , probably at the provocation of a dispute of this kind , the one .
As has already been mentioned , this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders : `` persons of public life have left to the discussion of the Roma issue representatives of radical political groups who have built their political strategy on the Roma Hungary-contrast ' .
It is believed that this aggravate the problem , make the sensible dialogue impossible , would benefit foot injuries , and increase the likelihood of violent clashes .
The Forschungsinsitut ausserdem believes that the activities of the Hungarian guard , not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media , 'damaging the image of Hungary abroad , particularly as regards the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity ' .
Let us remind ourselves that , since the autumn of 2006 , the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary is constantly on the rise , so that 2007 several since summer , founded 'national Selbstverteidigungsverein ' ablaze organisations .
'these groups have in common is that they be defined in each case as a civil organisation , while about them openly to prepare their members to - sometimes armed - civil defence tasks , defence , Ordnungshütung ) , by invoking the ineffectiveness of the police , the army , or to the state itself ( ' , ' .
And further : all of this is in accordance with the method which tried to disguise different , to the political and Parteiverdrossenheit the population-based , political aspirations as civil initiative .
The emphasis on the civilian nature and the Vereinsform serve not just the circumvention of legal obstacles , which could in the wake of the registration appear in court - it is also a political strategy .
As suggested in the analysis of the activities of the Hungarian guard constitute a risikoerhöhenden factor for the relations with neighbouring countries .
In recent months , the Hungarian guard was quoted in several of its neighbours as a potential source , some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain countries of the creation of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian-policy .
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region '- ' .
From the point of view of the research institute , the creation of the Hungarian guard not into East in central Europe , so the political risk has grown for the region as a whole .
As has already been mentioned , the activities of the Hungarian guard are Bulgarischen comparable with those of the National Guard , whose establishment in August 2007 has announced by the extreme right-wing Bulgarischen National Union ( BNU ) .
In the light of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard the Roma Massenausschreitungen that have taken place in a regeneration of Sofia ( Krasna Poljana ) .
The BNU has noted the incidents in the same way as the basis for establishing the Guard , with the argument that the aim of the organisation is the 'national protection ' .
In their view , was in the last 17 years a genuine 'Zigeunerterror ' in Bulgaria , the government has , however , remained indifferent and - as political plans .
And further : the initiative of contract had a heated debate in the Bulgarian public .
As I have said , the increased risk of ethnic conflict is shown by the fact that some of the Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to Widerstandszwecken to set up their own guards .
Since the activities of the Hungarian guard so far shows many similarities with which the Bulgarischen Guard it is not to exclude that the Hungarian Roma react with the Organisieren their own protection to the threats , it says in the case of political Risikowarnungsbericht plans .
Attila Juhász , Forschungsdirektor in political plans said on the question of the report : the risk analysis is one of the activities of the Forschungsinstitutes .
Every year , would be published Risikoanalyseberichte and risk-changing tendencies should be clear , public opinion will be kept informed , as in the case of the publication of the Risikowarnberichtes .

The election of the status quo
On Sunday , it will not be in the counting of the ballot box exciting : the bulk of the Russians will change for President Putin ’ s party , decide Vereintes Russia .
After a very abgeriegelten campaign it confirms its quest for stability , even after authoritarianism .
Three days before the parliamentary elections , the Russian President Vladimir Putin is a public television channels in the news in gaining access to the electorate , which has been recorded , whose content is kept secret , however .
He does so in his capacity as lead the United Russia , the pro-Kremlin-party , which was announced a stunning victory .
Yesterday , the President has nothing suggests , when he received the foreign embassies , and to provide a new target against the western powers , the accused of meddling ; his favourite subject during the election campaign was .
We are aware of the price  a true democracy and we hope that honest elections , very clear and open elections without `` fraud , he added .
From the point of view of the opposition , since they have missed .
It deplores the oppression-spattered election campaign .
The Communist leaders Guennadi Ziouganov says , it would never been  such dirty elections , not even `` at the time of Eltsin .
After the repression of demonstrations last weekend , for ex-substantial degree from remilitarisation Garry Kasparovder illegally for Demonstrieren was sentenced to five days in prison , according to his lawyer Besuchsverbot .
The Russians have  the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus ``
After these elections without much tension two further raises questions :
Who will take up  Putin ’ s successor as President ?
The Amtszeitung announced yesterday , the date of the first round of the presidential elections , 2 March 2008 ; the candidates have to make to 23 December time .
Since it was re-elected in 2000 and 2004 , Vladimir Putin can not stand for a third term of office in consequence .
And now a successor to take place .
What role will play Putin after March ?
Prime Minister , ?
The chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party Vereintes Russia to choose the government and President ?
What will be there , in the parliamentary or in the presidential elections , the current power will triumph .
Is a tradition .
The Russians  the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus have preserved , they are not `` masters of their own destiny , the sociologist Lev Goudkov , Director of the Independent thinks Levada centre .
The historian Nikolai Kopossov by the State University of St Petersburg goes even further back : civil society has evolved in this country , which has been christianisiert five centuries to Europe , only very slowly , the famous Community spirit which has delayed development of individuality .
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s Putin was needed to the model of a paternalistic State , which has been accepted by the population , all the more so , because to this new paternalism , followed by a terror , but a degree of economic prosperity , Maria Lipman from the Carnegie Foundation thinks .
Today , the Russians do  `` ``  voluntarily to the personal responsibility , which they have laid after the collapse of the USSR short-lived .
For a long time yet consider  What ? ``
This is a phenomenon that affects all sectors of society , including the business world .
And the Verwaltungselite understands it to maintain the status quo : 65 governors ( of 85 Russian Regionsvorsitzenden ) , the local lists of United Russia to lead .
The new , from the West next freedoms are often synonymous with chaos , as in the 1990s .
For the general public stability .
In this sense , the Russians will also vote for the extremist parties .
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko , a fifty-year-old teacher : for a long time yet consider  What ?
Those who are in power , are not so bad , why they replace ? ``

`` He is rather psychologically weak 'has been heard from the mouth of his superiors , indicate when the police .
As is evident from the statements Kerviels which the French media , for example , the newspaper Le Monde , published , he was a man , at the end of last year was made with his business profits in the sum of EUR 1.6 billion .
Crisis , not only in America
'Everything , is what I wanted to do was to earn money for my bank , ' he said in his statement .
In the summer , it was able to earn on the American crisis half a billion euro .
He had the opportunity already erspäht at the start of the year .
In February , there were already first news that so-called sub-prime-mortgages , as they residential customers or those who had previously Abzahlungsprobleme would be given to run into difficulties .
Influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis .
Kerviel did not believe and reserved the right .
At the end of the year , he had been spiralling its profit to EUR 1.6 billion .
'Very than I had deserves the first half a billion I did not know how I should explain that , ' Kerviel continue to exist and says that he had keep definitely nothing for itself .
During the whole interrogations , is it that he has falsified documents , so that we would not on the trail of these nefarious dealings .
It even managed to hold its head up the garden path , even if the gradually Eurex-stock market for interested its business .
Risikoprofit
He Befürchtete aufzufliegen ?
I hardly .
'I thought that it satisfies the simple fact that I voted for the Bank deserves 1.6 billion , ' .
Where he had the courage to be so much ?
He had to define its position gradually .
In the Société Générale it entered into force in the year 2000 , immediately after study at the end of the University of Lyon , had a .
Be compensate was around USD 51000 .
After two years he was already an assistant a broker and in the year 2005 , it was with a self-employed broker compensate by 90000 dollars .
Nevertheless , he knew that he would never deserve as much as others .
'Very during my first discussion in the year 2005 , I knew that we witnessed me .
For my training and also because of my professional and personal development , 'Kerviel declared the investigators .
But soon after its entry of the first great success .
With the shares of the Alliance he deserved much by the London bombings when he half a billion euro to Kursverluste this title .
And that was the cause - now he wanted more .
Until you gain method , we leave you
This is like a snowball , 'he said the police officers .
But the bosses supposedly knew of all , or jeopardising it .
'so long as I earned money , I closed my eyes ' .
But then the great blow came at the beginning of this year .
On a single day he lost a billion euros .
A weekend in mid-January he wanted to compensate for this .
On Monday , when he came to work , he was not an employee of the Bank .
And a few days later , the Bank announced that they have lost meeting five billion euros .
And how they came to him on the trail of these nefarious dealings ?
He made Verdächtig by a holiday .
'I have noted just four days from the previous year .
A broker , which does not go on holiday , is one which does not want that we look to him in the maps ' Kerviel finally said .

Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered a further hole the Hineinfallen ; his way out of that remains the same .
For British scandals this is not particularly schlüpfrig .
No title seem to be sold , paid any politician Paris Hotelrechnungen , been no wedlock gelutscht 'toes .
But the discovery that a rich businessman donations for the British Labour Government on more than £1.3 million dollars 650.000 ( ) on four years under the name of other people , and that the party has failed to notify this is something without which would be thousands of disputed territory of Gordon Brown well .
As the Prime Minister had two months ago , escaped the demand for an election dämliche way on the intelligence of British offensive by he claimed that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision , there were would hope that it will provide a strong , efficient government .
Instead , as Vince Cable , the increasingly insightful Vertretungsvorsitzende the Liberal Democrats , said , Mr Brown , feared by Stalin once to Mr Bean .
The heavy-handed saving Northern rock , a failing bank , showed regulatory weakness and poor judgement under attack .
Ill thought-out proposals to amend the tax laws have business groups against the government .
The tax system of loss of the personal data of 25 million people showed incredible administrative Pfuschereien .
A trio of generals retired to be launched an uprising in the House of Lords in protest at cuts of military expenditure : ministers of the armed forces , so they claimed , is a Teilzeitjob .
There is now the diverse donations of David Abraham ; Mr Watt , Labour 's Secretary-General ( and their former Erfüllungsleiter ) has already resigned .
None of this means that Brown irrevocable direction departure is on his way .
However , to govern governments to achieve a turning point , after which they find it impossible .
Neither politicians may people trust , but they are normally their scepticism , if a new force takes the office .
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation , and it needs to be not even a long time , this postponement is over : the public service is beginning to be leaking ; while the cabinet ministers unless instructed otherwise ; the press is bad news , and the government is defensive and no ambition .
In a way , the position of Brown is particularly difficult , because it can in contrast to other political leaders can not claim to be a new Besen .
So it would be to deny Tony Blair , he was lieutenant .
The problems with Northern rock and the Steuerzuständigkeitsunterlagen , for example , are , together with decisions as Chancellor Brown met the Treasury .
And it was not even if directly involved in Missgeschicke Blair , as in the case of long 'money for title ' -Untersuchung of political parties - the voters are perhaps the fact that he was it .
Nevertheless , Brown 's situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The errors are not so terrible , such as the Conservatives describe it .
As for Mr Bean , no one has ever died , or has been beschwindelt .
And the antidote , painful as it may be , is to supply , which have of course Brown Stalinist tendencies always pledged : a reliable , solid and easily brutal government .
The new political gesture donation is a good example .
The garboeske Abraham , compares its donations , with its non-profit-making gifts , he says , do not want any public recognition for its goodwill .
That may be so , but the decision was not him .
The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear and they exist from a clear reason : the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country .
Watt , who says he would know Abraham agreement , but not that it is illegal , as well as Jon Mendlesohn , Labour 's Hauptfinanzeintreiber , on the odd donations has been told in October will of course have to ask some questions .
But so far Brown is not involved : there is nothing that indicates that he knew of this confusion , although most of the payments has been made his appointment in June .
To date , the Prime Minister has finished half of the work .
He has condemned the violation of the law by his party , but he watered-down this determination by seizing a well-known instrument , a committee of inquiry on the issue - to make this measure , a bishop in retirement and a judge .
In this case , the 'lessons to be learned from ' are not very complicated .
If the law has been broken , it is a matter for the police .
Apart from that , there are other things must make Mr Brown , as something to find a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life , which is for the last six months vacant , and to proceed with a radical reform of political parties .
It would require the hard-liners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party such as Mr Brown .
However , it should be aware of some partisan facts .
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls ; he has two years to restore voters ; and the only way it can achieve a victory , is indisputable rectitude and sound competence .

England faced with decision on the statements made by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas , each almost as difficult as the other .
Who is going to propose a No 6 for Kandy England in this weekend Owais or Shah Ravi Bopara ?
And , no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka , who is to make the decision ?
The second question is important because David Graveney , Wahlvorsitzende to call at least under this specific title , is here , to decide , in order to help the Cheftrainer Peter Michael Vaughan Moores and the captain , and because the table of high Morries , the English executive director , is gradually filling up with applications for national Wählerämter , if not even for what part-time work .
Anyone who has not always the sixth Schlägerposition will be unfortunate , but life is often unfair and sport is without doubt it .
It is never easy to apply exactly what a person at the top of its Berufszweiges , while someone else will never , on the lowest status , sometimes due to a lack of good will .
It is not only in the cricket , where the choice is difficult , where decisions are needed , which are always at the end of subjective .
Is it the right time to forge ahead Bopara ?
Is it fair to Shah if he is doing this ?
The same may be needed in a further area if , for example , John Edwards or 'Tubby ' Banerjee , both intelligent young managers should be promoted with good qualifications are familiar with the business .
Who can say what the right class , is for a cricketers , unless it is given the opportunity to swim or submerged .
Of course , numbers have a major influence on decisions , but also have opportunities .
Within a team a cricketers must catch the eye of the master of the ship at the right time , if he can take a Wicket and a bat regular opportunities must be given in order , if he wants to make as a one-day cricketers impression .
To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complicated .
There were many who in the last season better than , for example , as James Anderson , apparently , which will be the first test , even if Stephen Harmison declared itself for healthy and as the wind kegelt in the networks .
Anderson , 32 a first-class Wickets with 33 Runs in order to earn a position in this tour .
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average , but both had their high points and hope to even more .
Or whether Shah Bopara Asgiriya plays in stage , can only be a Ansichtsfrage .
The election could decide the careers of both men , or perhaps it makes little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in each test and has been successful in the first , with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs but that it was Paul Collingwood , then kämpfend to consolidate , managed to a significant breakthrough Testkricketspieler and , even though he punktete a dual hundred against Australia in Australia , perhaps still underestimated .
That will probably Graveney , Vaughan Moores and , after a further discussion in the context of the current Netzsitzung Asgiriya stage in its Conservative instincts and Bauchgefühl Shahs will follow for more experience on Boparas young enthusiasm .
There are arguments for both .
He speaks for Shah funkelnden and valuable 88 test-debut-Innings in Mumbai , 43 first-class Bopara hundreds and only six of the seven years younger with 22 years , and an excellent record against angedrehtes bullets .
But Shah only ten Runs in its two Innings against the West Indies in May on the test in Lord , its Heimatarena as a player from Middlesex , and this , plus the immediate rejection of the Auswählern than Vaughan healthy was to withdraw his position for the next game , seems to have taken the momentum from his fighting , which was still in Mumbai .
On the contrary , the Alleskönner from Essex has schaufelweise vibrancy .
It is not a Kricketplatz impressed on the sidelines , and its attitude has come to the point , when he recently had a car with an exhibition Vierradantrieb Volkswagen sponsor of England .
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock , but the first thing he did was also , of course , be Vodaphone ( gesponsort ) and its Teamkollegen Alastair Cook , monitoring of this from a distance and enthusiastically to say : `` Have you seen ? ' .
Bopara is a much better Feldspieler that he be kegelt Mitteltempo here with some effect on the playing fields , which seems to fit to him and proposes with confidence and skill .
To choose the right man one thing to choose the right moment is another .
Perhaps that is the real art of choice .
I am inclined to give his chance Bopara now , which does not mean that will be left Shah may not be a good idea if he is the person who , as the Teesatz from Sri Lanka suggested , play this weekend .

In the islands of the Caribbean find you the in überreichlichem level .
The problem on an island find They but even more vulnerable , and the island is Cuba , the largest and best the by the West Indies .
At the moment the Spaniard was Cuba the bastion for the US economy .
Columbus called it the most beautiful place , the the a human mind king has .
Havana was once to a grouping or Durchgangslager of wonders , which had stolen the Spanish in the United States and then to Europe used .
And it was the American era .
The hotel Nacional was very at the end of the 20th century .
Erbauen was it a the leaders of the United States mafia , Lucky Luciano , for all , and in the United States as a crime was , particularly during the state draft it , was like seen in Cuba and supported , drugs , gambling , prostitution .

In addition the Kultautos the Fünfziger driving in Havana still around , however , because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salzigen and feuchten air have had for a long time auseinandergefallen are .
The Havana , particularly his eldest part , very much heruntergekommen be , in any way is it in their field so many wonderful colonial marvels as right here .
Some other places are just herausgeputzt , for example Trinidad .
In with regard to , that the tourism urgent benötigtes money is , was it for the development the green light .
In the last 15 years are not only in Havana new hotels have been , however , but also in Varadero , on the coast the province Holguín and also to Inselchen as Cayo Coco , Cayo Guillermo and others .
Cuba is still a Marotte , however , which is unique in the world and above all Eisenbahnliebhaber attractive .
The sugar cane of remote plantations were dampf- and dieselbetriebene Schmalspurbahnen to the Zuckerfabriken .

For example must be on Varadero or Havana no longer at length write .
The only to say , however , that is in previously mentioned plots Hemingways a museum is , whose visit is people , the the author is , not pass should be .
The Viñales-Tal in the West of the island is a the malerischsten corner Cuba .
The huge vegetation is growing to Kalkboden .
The Mogotas , Kalkhügel and -felsen , ragen steep by the Committee Talboden to , in their Hohlräumen sammelte is fertile ground in respect of this matter , by the also verwitterte Felsbereiche of dichtem Bewuchs turn are .
In this valley , it is where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is grown .
In his or her Endform can you on it taken , if you a the Zigarrenfabriken of Havana visit .
It is it some also interesting , however , that there the Chilean result the Fernsehserie ' Major Zeman which tide was .
Trinidad
A long-standing city , the very briefly , after the Spanish have colonised the island , built was .
Opulence and wealth was it of the trade with slavery and sugar .
The wealth verkörperte is in the schmucken beauty of the small town .
The Spanish Kolonialarchitektur , very much influenced by the later French settlers , has been for four hundred years not changed .
Trinidad , between the sea and the Escambray-Gebirge important , however , is a very remote place , that it be still in the Fünfziger years of the last century no road was , the the area associated with the other country would .
This isolation was to with regard , that it was adverse .
Nothing has been built there , but it also not demolished , everyone was pleased , however , that it a roof on the head had .
If we for Trinidad more than a afternoon time has , however , it is it is , interesting places in the environment must , as for example the beach Playa Ancón or the ' valley the Zuckerfabriken out .
The night should be it in the Casa de la Música are , however , which is preparing for the streets , and where the music to morning not keep quiet .
Baracoa
This Städtchen all in the East of Cuba described some as the best of the island .
It is this view but also by the way to influence .
Both roads , the of Guantanamo to lead , we should have a high level and zerküftete Mountains through and developed by a landscape , which is not affect of human intervention .

Political Capital the following reasons Ungarische guard increased Staatsrisiko
The believe the department for a risk analysis , Risk Analysing division draft it of political Capital have the activities of in this August with support the ' movement for a better Hungary which up Ungarischen guard the risk Hungary and the region in many ways increased .
In ' Risikowarnungs-Bericht \ '' the Institute is it among other things , In this context with the activities the Ungarischen guard is the highest political risk the \ '' stepped up the existing ethnic tensions between the home and Nicht-Zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary in Parliament , the even the short term to violent ethnic clashes lead could out .
Reason for this is the strategy the Ungarischen guard , which I believe to the provocation of this conflict which , as the Committee .
In the meantime , will be seen as a failure from the political leaders ' people of the public life have the debate the Roma-Frage representatives radical political groups to it , the now their political strategy to the Roma-Ungarn-Gegensatz set up have out .
It is , however , that this the problem worse , the reasonable dialogue impossible to make , Extremitäten they , as well as the likely violent clashes increase would .
The Forschungsinsitut believes ausserdem , the activities of the Union Ungarischen guard would , however , not least thanks the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media , ' the image Hungary in the world much damage , especially what the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity is out .
We know we , For autumn 2006 is the reorganisation of radical and very good groups in Hungary a daily basis in the recovery , and for summer 2007. several , is ' national Selbstverteidigungsverein which nennende organisations established were .
Of These groups is common , however , that it will be a civil organisation definition , and it open to boast , its members to , sometimes armed , really prepare for disasters , defence , Ordnungshütung draft it , in an appeal to the particularly the police , the army , or the State itself out , said it .
And continue . All this is under the method , which an attempt , different , to the policies and Parteiverdrossenheit of the population based , political aspirations and Civil initiative to sweeping .
The emphasis of the civilian character and the Vereinsform which is not just the people of legal hurdles , which could appear in court within the framework of the registration , it is also a political strategy .
As to was the analysis is , however , are the activities of Ungarischen guard a risikoerhöhenden factor also for the relations with the countries which .
\ '' In the last few months was the Ungarische guards in several countries as potential source she said , so some ultranationalistischer politicians certain neighbouring countries is in the creation of Ungarischen guard the confirmation its own Anti-Ungarn-Politik .
All this has repercussions on the political stability of the region \ '' , said it .
In the view of the institute is the set up the Ungarischen guard not Einzelphänomen in Zentral-Ost-Europa , therefore is the political risk for the whole region has increased .
In the meantime , however , are the activities the Ungarischen guard with the Bulgarischen Nationalgarde a par , which was founded in August 2007 of rechtsextremen Bulgarischen National the European Union , BNU draft it announced was .
In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian guards were the Roma-Massenausschreitungen , the in a urban areas of Sofia , Krasna Poljana draft it been have .
The BNU has the events at the an opportunity to set up the Nationalgarde taken , with the argument , that the objective of the organisation the ' national protection which is .
Your opinion has been other words in the last 17 years a real ' Zigeunerterror out in Bulgaria . , the government was , however , stand and indifferent , as political Capital .
In addition to , The initiative was a heated debate in the Bulgarian public losgetreten .
As I said , the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also by the fact been verified , that some Bulgarian Roma-Organisationen announced have , to Widerstandszwecken their own guards to create .
As the activities of Ungarischen guard so far too many similarities with those the Bulgarischen Nationalgarde is , is it not be excluded , that the Hungarian gypsies also , with the Organisieren their own protection on the threats act , is it in Risikowarnungsbericht of political Capital .
Attila Juhász , Forschungsdirektor in political Capital said in an oral question of Nachrichtenbüros : The analysis is a the activities of Forschungsinstitutes .
It would Risikoanalyseberichte made public , and should risikoverändernden trends be clear , it is not the public opinion informed , as in the case of the provision of Risikowarnberichtes .

For example have it Mr Blanco , Organisationssekretär the Popular , and Bono in the conference announced , after today in the party headquarters a meeting with Zapatero took place .

Bono would be Manuel Martin and Kongresspräsidenten a substitute . This was the last 15 November announced , in the next year Generalwahlen no longer stand , to end his career in the public policy and are instead in universitären area for the change to .

The had made it to go , that the party , as in the appointment of the Vice-President for the environment , the citizens not not want , who in the event of an election victory the posts of Kongresspräsidenten take would , and described it as a Akt the Transparenz '' .
If it should play the role indeed , it hopes he the chamber in a `` Haus of the respect and not of the insult or the Geschreis '' turn , for them as the Bürgern always similar before us to lassen . ''
`` Bedauerlicherweise all we of time to time the impression , rather than or not the only place , in which we in Madrid not calm and not talk can , is the Congress , it was the Regierungspräsident in the Senate again to to 26 time unterbrochen . ''
At the same time praised it the current President Manuel Martin and seine good Arbeit '' and deutete to , he wanted not the impression that , the position already assumed to have , because otherwise the country 's political Gegenspieler this as Arroganz '' call would .

The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan in just a few minutes for Achtelfinale
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will on next Tuesday in San Siro at the point are fighting , the them is missing , to their respective objectives still in a successful conclusion the Championsleague-Vorrunde . . The Italians need the point to to the top of their group to reach , and this in the Scots on the United States . .
The Italian team has already five points and have the United States as early as in the fifth round with a Unentschieden in Portugal confirmed , while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points or another needed , in order no doubt to go , that the FC Shakhtar with six points the Befica Lisbon with four points not how .

The team of Gordon Strachan could even in a Schlappe the FC Shakhtar a defeat meet in order to qualify itself .

The Benfica Lisbon could despite its lower Tabellenposition and without the prospect , still in the most important European championship take part to us , gain the third place with a victory and other words in the UEFA out .

Pain of the Labour
Gordon Brown has not only a more Grube to Hineinfallen discovered , be way from this and will continue to be the same .
As far as the United Kingdom scandals is it not particularly schlüpfrig .
Not one of them Adelstitel seem sold , do not have it politician Paris Hotelrechnungen paid , not außerehelichen Zehen gelutscht been to .
But the issue , however , that a wealthy businessman donations for the British governing Labour party on more than 650,000 pounds , 1.3 million dollars , more than four years in the name of other people cover has , and that the party has failed to to say that , is something no longer the the umkämpfte Gordon Brown well ausgekommen would .
The two months ago the Prime Minister is the call for a choice they had , to dämliche one way or another the intelligence of the British offensive , by it had , that opinion polls this decision not on have , was it hope , that it would provide a robust , effective government .
Instead of which , as Vince Cable , the in ever greater extent clever Vertretungsvorsitzende the Liberal Democrats , said it , has is the einstmals feared Brown of Stalin to had . Bean developed .
The heavy-handed measures of Northern implementing , a folding bank , however , was regulatorische weakness and poor judgment in attack .
When reasonable proposals for change of the taxes have Unternehmensverbände found against the government .
The steuerbehördliche loss of personal data of 25 million people was inconceivable administrative Pfuschereien taken into account .
A trio of generals in retirement launched a rebellion in the Lords in protest against cuts of military , Minister of the forces to be , I thought it , is a Teilzeitjob .
Now is it the many donations of David Abrahams , Mr watts , Labours General Secretary , and her former Erfüllungsleiter draft it is already resigned .
The fact is , however , that Brown no direction Abtritt aufbricht .
We can governments a turning point achieve , under which they it impossible have to government .
There are still rely on people politicians , but believe they do their scepticism go back , if a new force taking the office .
If it even clear is , that it unlikely is , however , that a Prime Minister improve the situation , and it is still not even a long time in to , is this delay over : the public service begins leaking to be , the Kabinettsminister start to plaudern , the press seeking to bad news , and the government is defensive and ziellos .
In a way is the position of Brown particularly difficult , because it on the other hand to other political leaders not say is concerned , a new Besen to .
The more than he denied Tony Blair would , was it be Oberleutnant .
The problems with Northern implementing and the Steuerzuständigkeitsunterlagen , for example , are together with decisions , was the Brown as a Chancellor of the Finance .
And even if the not directly involved has been in Blair Missgeschicke , as in the long ' money for Adelstitel which TIMSS of political party financing , are the electorate may be in place , that he it was .
In spite of that is Browns situation quite so bad , as it is
The deficiencies are no longer so terrible , as the Conservatives describe it .
As in had . Bean , no one is dead , or was completely beschwindelt .
And the your solutions , difficult as it may be , is deliver , and Browns of course stalinistische trends and promised have : A reliable , sound and easily brutal government .
The new behaviour for political donations is a very good example .
The garboeske Abrahams , the the country 's donations with his non-governmental talents compared , said he would not public recognition to be good .
This is perhaps it be , but the decision on this was him not to .
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are quite clear and they are in a clear reason , the public has a right to know to know , who have access to those buy can , which the Member States government .
Watts , the say it would of Abrahams agreement find out , but not , however , that it is illegal , will are of course some questions face , just as Jon Mendlesohn , Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber , the on the extraordinary donations in October told was .
But so far is Brown not involved , It is not , however , that to there , that it of this confusion once again , although the majority of the payment was made in June after his office .
It has the Prime the part of the work done .
He has quickly the violation of the law by his party condemned , but he verwässerte this decision by the very to a well known instrument , a inquiry on the issue , which , in order to fully make the level , of a Bishop in retirement and a judge .
In this case are the ' it to ziehenden lessons which do not very complicated .
If the law has been broken , is it a matter for the police .
In fact is it other things which Mr Brown to make must , as a a permanent chairman of the independent Committee for standards in public life to the European Union , the unfilled for six months is , and move forward with a radical reform of political parties .
That would of the hard-liners of the Labour require with the Conservatives to cooperate and perhaps the very close financial relationship with the unions give up , bitter pills for a party as Mr Brown .
But it should be some having a clear on one thing .
The Conservatives have now a very strong lead in the opinion polls , he has two years to voters back , and the only way , as it a victory achieve can , is by undisputed strongly and solid enough power .

British Bänker the European People 's to blame in case Enron
Three British bankers , the for their role in fraudulent the system with the former Hauptfinanzleiter of Enron , Andrew Fastow , will be brought to justice should , change on Wednesday their requests in the duty .
David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally for seven cases of fraud in a great deal of Telekommunikationsmitteln for the so-called Konspirieren with Fastow in a secret Finanzbetrug in year 2000 in order to themselves to costs their employer to improve , called on innocent .
The process has been set in the January .
But during a hearing before the courts in US-Distriktrichter Ewing Werlein Junior plädierte any for a case of fraud under a great deal of Telekommunikationsmitteln blame .
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest , a unit of Royal bank of Scotland Group PLC , were in Britain in the course of extradition , the two years dauerten , well known .
In the United States is their case a loses the end a study , which was launched in 2001 after Enrons collapse .
The was against it 's accusations in the year 2002 when Fastow pointed out , that it the objective a study of the government in connection with the decline Enron was .
The charges against the bankers , called the ' NatWest three out , said , however , they are in the year 2000 to Houston has , to a fraudulent Komplott with Fastow and his former Topberater Michael Kopper auszuhecken .
Greenwich Natwest , a partnership of Enron in a subsidiary investment , the of Fastow checked was , however , the the architect of myriad fraudulent Enron-Machenschaften has been , who contributed to this , the company in the Konkursstrudel to win .
The beginning of 2002 , the bank the value their participation in the subsidiary to no weapons , but the three British men were , that it was great value in reality .
A company in Koppers control erwarb the shares of the bank to the subsidiary for 1 million dollars .
The bankers began Kopper 250,000 the dollar for a participation in the company .
The the case was Fastow that to Enron , however , that the Energieunternehmen 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the subsidiary pay would be .
But actually went out the 20 million dollars to the British bankers , Fastow and others .
The bankers were 7.3 million dollars , while Fastow and Kopper and other more or less 12.3 million dollars absahnten , according the indictment .
In January 2004 well known Fastow is in two clear to conspiracy for his role in the collapse Enrons the duty .

Kopper is a sentence of three years and a month in a set up in Texarkana from .
Each of the three men was to free able to The reason a 1 million dollars bail , the it necessary was , that it in the United States in anticipation of the trial were .
Enron , once the siebtgrößte companies of the nation , zerbröckelte in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks no longer the Milliardenschulden code or faltering enterprises profitable before us here , .
The collapse vernichtete thousands of jobs , more than 60 billion value and more than two billion dollars pension plans in place .
The Enron-Gründer Kenneth Lay and the former managing director Jeffrey Skilling were last year for their roles in connection with the Enron-Zusammenbruch condemned .

Kartenhaie
Steckt the Kreditkrise America 's Kreditkartenmarkt to ?
If blood in the water is , is it is only of course , that Rückenflossen weapons herumwirbeln .
Now where America 's Immobilienmarkt kränkelt , have the Raubtiere the Kreditkartenmarkt of the country in the manner .
Analysts from Goldman Sachs can expect to , that the Kreditkartenverluste reach 99 billion dollars could , if is the infection of under-funded loans to other forms of Verbrauchenkrediten more common .
Signs of the negotiations are more visible .
There are Anstiege both in the Ausbuchungen as well as in the Säumnisraten , the the number of the loans measure , the each not einziehbar or more than 30 days too late are .
The HSBC has last month announced , however , that they a 1.4 billion dollars charges from their the United States Verbraucherfinanzierungen taken has , in part because of weakness of Kreditkartennehmern .
It is still too early , in order to fall in panic .
Losses and Säumnisse are still too low .
The the Ratingagentur Moody has been the Drittquartals-Säumnissrate of 3.89 % almost a full point in the historic average .
The deterioration in the rates can be explained by technical factors to some extent .
An amendment in the the United States Privatinsolvenzrechtsgesetzen in 2005 led to a abrupten case of Konkursanmeldungen , which in turn for a large number of Keditkartenverluste the total number , the number of applications , and it Säumnisgebühren draft it would again increase , or not is the general conditions for borrowers that or not .
The industry reported also of solid Zahlungsraten , the see , however , how much of its debt the consumers each month abbezahlen
And the vote of confidence in kreditkartenbasierte securities is quite strong , despite the Stillstandes in other corners of the structured financing .
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup , a Forschungsunternehmen , certainly expected to , that the Ausgabemengen for 2007 after all the 25 % higher be will as a last year .
It Infektionskanäle between the Immobilienkreditkrise and the Kreditkartenmarkt is it no doubt , it is likely , however , that consumers Kreditkartenschulden to admit , now that Eigenheimkredite remove .
The Kartenaussteller a good look but to the Geldfluss rather than to Kapitalwerte , therefore the solution falling Hauspreise not necessarily a change in the Kreditwürdigkeit the Kreditnehmers from .
You can even for the Kartenaussteller of an advantage be .
The incentives for consumers , the Hypothekenraten continue to pay , will fall , when the property less value are rather than the value of the loan ; rather than The result will the Kartenschulden in the Rückzahlungsprioritäten important .
Kartenaussteller can also a great deal more rapid , more flexible and Kreditgeber to the stürmischeren conditions respond , by it interest rates or Kreditgrenzen change .
That should in theory the risk a quick reassessment of the assets reduce .
' We will not one day wake up and assess the loans completely new out , says Gary Perlin , Capital Ones Hauptfinanzreferent .
Even if a sudden Unterdeckungskrise in Kreditkartenmarkt unlikely is , however , are the risks of a sustainable slowdown very real .
If lower Hauspreise and a Kreditminderung the United States in the recession press , will the industry no doubt in a grimmigeren future are .
Is it any further proposals to this finning .

Everything is still open
Mitt Romey has said , it is it not a President worthy , of a Schneemann are being asked to it .
But said is the republican candidate for the Presidency is prepared , however , is a debate on YouTube . , in which ordinary voters issues on video to admit and submit , to send the candidate countries about it .
No the issues , the on Mittwochabend , the 28 November , however , raised were , were so ridiculous as the Schneemann , the Democrats on the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party asked .
But the questions , and the answers , spiegelten this time is the state of the republican party which , the in the elections in the next year aufbricht .
It is not known , however , exactly how the producers of CNN , the the debate mitunterstützten , the the angehenden candidates to trend YouTube Clips auswählten .
But in the first half hour of the debate , the longest the a different issue that was , was immigration in the heart .
The issue is one thing the schlagkräftigsten issues for republicans .
The CNN asked a group of tied voters a Wählscheibe to meet , if they said things , however , the they admired , The Fernsehanstalt said Spitzen the agreement as the candidate countries strictly on the borders said .
The harshest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani , the national champion , and Romney , the are in the most critical surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire to lead geschoben has .
Giuliani tried to the reputation abzuschütteln , it is industry-friendly on illegal immigration has been , when he was Mayor of New York .
It attackierte Romney in which he accused the former Governor of Massachusetts , illegal immigrants to work in the House an end to this situation .
The two got a particularly strong point as Mr Gallagher asked , whether a the candidates a ' amnesty ' , the illegal immigrants a legal status and the way in which citizenship there would draft it support would .
Unbedeutendere candidate countries as Duncan Hunter , a kalifornischer Kongressabgeordneter , and Tom Tancredo , a Kongressabgeordneter from the Colorado regions , was it in the subject nachzuhaken .
No one the two men has serious chance in the nomination , but they remain in the race , perhaps because they used and more than others to the Immigrationspauke gehauen have .
At least in the field of immigration share the candidates in more or less the same views , up borders , intolerance to illegal immigrants .
This issue , however , together with concerns about toxic toys from China or other concerns of the rest of the world , help the republicans to forget the differences between Liberal and Christian Conservatives and to emigrate .
But the debate was clearly a major problem and other issues raised have been .
Mr President Giuliani was asked , and it Waffenrestriktionen in the past supported have .
John McCain and Romney under discussion about , whether simuliertes drowning will be seen as a torture should .
One of the questions asked , whether the candidate countries believe every word of the Bible .
This led to , that Giuliani the position was , however , that although the Bible is his particular book , he the history of Jonah and the Wal perhaps not quite believe .
The other questions asked , whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
Mike Huckabee , now against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa with his existing for a long time Christian Konservativismus , said , however , that the death painful , but necessary is .
As he has been urged to it , whether Jesus they support would , lachte it on and said Jesus was to intelligence in order to apply it for a political office .
The race remains very much open .
Huckabees It in Iowa is the same time with Ron Pauls recent Spendenerfolgen and his Beifallsstürmen in the debate of Wednesday .
The two are from the That hochgeschossen , because the two side of the party is so far yet to a the bekannteren and advocates candidates a number could .
In year 1980 and 2000 has a candidate country the party from the outset and man united with a winning message on the size America 's and a Zwinkern to two over the party .
This time is divided the party and the result is a long chalk not clear .

Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi the following reasons Voruteile fall
In order to tell the truth , I was not a particular Fan of Peugeot 206 .
The Fahreigenschaften were not a great deal worth , the quality of Gangschaltung , the management and also the processing could be a more unterdurchschnittlich call .
But now is its successor , the Peugeot 207 , on the market , and the is a long way to go better .
The Kombi with the name SW is still a bit further , and I will continue to be only , to change my opinion .
As I the traditional Hatchback the 207 tested a while ago , had I am for example on the too little Kopffreiheit to the Hintersitzen why .
The complaints are it now no longer , as the Karosserie the Kombi is such a way , that not even Zweimetermänner are suffering will .
It further
The Innenausstattung am I just very briefly by , to me not too much to happen again .
It is not only to a very clear design , where I just for the kümmerlichen Mitteltunnels any comments have .
In fact would be I more designerische make a good thing , where the car or a so elegant impression is .
The seats are convenient , and no longer have the time , where we are possible with regard to brief seats or Kopfstützen line .
The the Seitenhalt has is to the build a great deal better .
What the Raumangebot is concerned , however , can we make the vergrößerten size the Karosserie feel .
The Kombi is also the already mentioned problem to Kopffreiheit been removed .
Luggage in the Kofferraum
The most important question in this car is but the Laderaum .
We must I , also for the aufklappbaren Rückfensters draft it as a very good thing beladbar and platzsparend call .
The Hohlräume are with Haltegurten which , however , the a perfect compromise . .
You do not interfere , it is auseinanderziehen and our opinion also heavy items said .
But have we us with regard the Ladevolumen .
It is the table in the protection . 428 litres , and in the Committee with respect to competition a more average value is .
Of course not compared to in the Czech Republic meistverkauften vehicle this class , the Škoda Fabia Combi .
If we the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav compared , are we note , however , that the Peugeot to clear very substantial 52 litres act .
As far as a Auslandsurlaub or the Einladen a Kinderwagens is of the value already critical .
But in order the Positiva stressed , however , then I have the to the Umklappen the Rücksitze all conditions Laderaum or also the very low Ladekante mention .
120 PS in four ranks
Our Testwagen has been with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor with Hubraum 1.6 litres and a service of 88 kW power .
And quite frankly , it should be a 1600-Kubik-Motor be , the a Familien-Hatchback antreibt .
It is quiet , has a low consumption and is very well off .
If I it with his counterpart in Škoda Even , the some cases has , rather than would be Auspuff with a Lappen vehicle , then can I of him only look be .
The Preisliste talking about themselves
The price of the vehicle is not just favouring .
We must us but to remind you , however , that we a well equipped car with a geräumigen Innneren and a very good engine tested have .
The Grundpreis of the cars with the 1400er Benzinmotor in level of 329900 kroner is still in respect of this matter .
In our engine costs it from 410900 kroner , which I have quite a great deal is .
The equipment Premium the Testwagens forward once again with 80000 kroner in addition to effect .
We have had but not Kopfairbags , automatic Klimaanlage , automatic Scheibenwischerauslösung , electrical Fensterheber at and und ...
For example costs the car as a whole straightforward 531900 kroner .
This is a great deal , but can you again the Zusatzausstattung a Fabia together and you are going to get in a very similar amount .
This is just the decision , however , the rate will choose it .

The United States have already indicated , that it on specific figures do not negotiate want , but would be prepared , by 2020 the greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 to 25-40 percent to reduce .
The other major issue of the Conference is , whether the Declaration prepared are , as well as the reduction of emissions the countries both financially , and technology to support .
It was also an agreement on the support of developing countries reached .
That the Kyoto Protocol has insinuated Anpassungsfonds is of a 16-köpfigen managed Council will , most likely in the World Umweltfazilität , GEF draft it the the United Nations , as in ' Piac és profit out after country is .

The minister said , the EU will by 2020 the greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % reduction , compared to the values of 1990 draft it , they in fact , whether the ' agreement after 2012. which successfully reached will , or not . Europe is even prepared , is for a 30-prozentige reduction to , soferne other major Declaration the world , and . developing countries also prepared are , their commitments to the best of our ability and responsible for .

The demand for them is reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to 6 in with respect to the years 1985-87 , a target , which it can do is , as is stated in the press of the Ministry .
The use is high in Bali , at least must the long-term international klimapolitische agreement within two years ' time ready be , if not would be it certainly only after 2012 into force . In this case would be the laid down in the Kyoto Reduktionsvorhaben not new , international Emissionsreduktionssystem the same , the importance also the IPCC , the the international community , with the Friedensnobelpreis excellent scientific Klimawandel-Komitee the United Nations in his recent report pointed out has .

Will the money but not too high dosiert or unsachgemäß applied , may arise from the well respondierenden away Antibiotika-resistente , which is under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly spread .
In particular in patients with geschwächtem , or the long term a bad thing funktionierendem Immunsystem , and in older , or patients with small Körpergewicht can this away serious infections , example Wundinfektion or Blutvergiftung , other words Sepsis , cause .
The medical head of János hospital , is the MRSA-Infektion nothing special , however , such incidents are the Krankehausalltag .
We should the policy no longer with the disease between , manhte Tibor Nyulasi , MRSA is it only there not , where they will did not find .
Resistent against antibiotics
Of Such patients are isolated , however , the Pflegepersonal is Gummihandschuhe and Masken in the supply , and we have on the for the deal with necessary antibiotics which , it Tibor Nyulasi .
In the EU 's Einlieferung hospital will the patients are to MRSA under investigation , a infection can still do not always avoided .
Probenentnahmen to rarely
The majority of by MRSA caused infections in hospitals would be avoided , but that the currently prevailing conditions and circumstances good for the control of the creation or the spread of multiresistenten Erregers , however , say Karolina Böröcz .
After the infection mainly in hospitals and Altersheimen do , however , should the Spitäler the eingelieferten patients into consideration and MRSA-infizierte immediately isolate .
In the Hungarian hospitals will the microbiological authorisation but not too many into practice .
Last , but not least because it from the state Krankenkasse no support for this investigation is .
The most cases would therefore be brought out into the light of day , if the patients have a bemerkbare MRSA-Infektion has , so the medical head of Epidemiologiezentrums .
The of the European Union is it strict recommendations on this matter use of antibiotics in the medicine , it is and in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and Krankheitsbilder .
Antibiotika-Therapien should must be , that is , however , microbiological studies are necessary , it is no Resistenz against the resources which can , but will this directive of hospitals also not always complied with .
In the ambulanten , or are in the care and patients are microbiological handling Probenentnahmen even more rare , however , it Karolina Böröcz .
Gespart will with regard the Desinfektionsmitteln
Scientific evidence show , however , that MRSA of a patients on the other on most of Pflegepersonal it will .
For that reason is the Händewaschen , or the role of Handschuhen and Masken a great importance to , but is it also in this area a great deal shortcomings in the hospitals .
MRSA is by Tröpfcheninfektion or a daily basis and , in the future hospitals is but not always the possibility , to isolate the infected patients .
The room is even often overloaded , the beds only each other gereiht , although it should be a gap of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological perspective .
As Karolina Böröcz further points out , is it unfortunately in the financial much less good and hospitals even before , that in Desinfektionsmitteln saved will , it is only a few Pfleger , many patients , all factors , the the source of infection is they .
The infections are there are far less often , or can be the further spread of Erregers Against Racism will , where these measures will be adhered to , as Karolina Böröcz .
Programme against MRSA
MRSA-Infektionen in the top at all . the health insurance enormous costs , it will therefore be opposed .
In the United Kingdom for example was the prevention of MRSA , and their control held in programme .
The first signs is the programme a success , as published data show , is the trend the MRSA-Infektionen in the United Kingdom down .
The European centre for Krankheitsprävention The ECDC draft it has the prevent the creation of multiresistenten flies , including also MRSA draft it , as well as the prevention of infection in hospitals to a its priorities said .

New concerns with regard Erdgasstreit between Russia and the Ukraine
A new Preisstreit conflict between the Ukraine and Russia , which the risk increased , however , that Russian exports of fuel will be affected in Europe .
The most important part of Russian Erdgasexporte in the European Union , the European Union , is led by the Ukraine and any dispute between the two Nations is closely watched .
Kiev has be warned , however , that if Moscow the price , the it to pay for the gas must , increased , it of Russia higher Transitgebühren in mind are will .
A former conflict between the two countries in the last year reduced supplies in the EU .
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow has happened at a time , to the the Ukrainian government and the Russian , state Gasmonopol Gazprom try an agreement on to achieve this , how much the Ukraine for Russian gas pay in the year 2008 must .
The Gazprom is the Ukraine more calculated will be , because the company agreed has to to 50 percent more for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan to pay .
Analysts say , however , that this potentially could , that the Ukraine Forty per cent more to pay for the imports of Gazprom must .
' It is important for us , our arguments rather than a the most important Gastransitstaaten in talks to out , said the Minister of Economic Affairs of Ukraine Anatoly Kinakh the Nachrichtenagentur Reuters .
' The is changing Erdgaspreise should no doubt with our arguments on the total amount of Transitgebühren -LSB-nach Westeuropa-RSB- on the Ukraine , will . which
The most recent major Erdgasstreit between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 hand Gazprom supplies in the country .
This , in succession to a case of exports to Western Europe , and the prices drastically reduced in the level stridently .
Russisches gas is a quarter of the supply of the European Union from .
Russia has the world 's largest gas , but much of it is underdeveloped .
The result is , however , that Gazprom its own reserves of gas from Turkmenistan and other zentralasiatischen former Soviet Nations added .

Some ministries celebrate with Live-Musik , however , other miracles Weihnachtsstimmung with Tombola or possessed in the Beamtenherzen .
Party , however , Weihnachtsstimmung , Konzerte and Buffet , it is the power .
The Weihnachtsfieber has already as well as the bodies covered .
The most important Weihnachtsfeier a Ministry will this year in Verteidigungsressort held , but will to do not the staff of the Ministry expected .

The area is about 25 million for the revolved at our disposal .
In comparison to other areas , the National agency for development , NFÜ draft it and the Ministry for the environment and Transport on the encouraged .
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Weihnachtsfeier the Wirtschaftsministeriums will in the House of the future held , it will be less than 350 the 600 people expected .
The main focus of revolved is doing so on Christmas , it will and Live-Acts and a Tombola-Verlosung the people .
The National agency for development , NFÜ draft it has their 4,7 million Forint more expensive Weihnachtsfeier on Wednesday in the House of Landesjustizrates ( OIT draft it held , with Konzerten and a Festessen .
The Saalmiete was 1 million Forint , the rest was in favour of the more than 400 geladene guests spent .
According to the information available to us is a department the NFÜ also in another Weihnachtsfeier invited , the the Ungarischen Wirtschaftsentwicklungszentrum ( MAG Zrt draft it from EU funds organised will .
As far as the celebration was the building of Lustspieltheaters ' Vígszínház ' else .
The MAG Zrt has this information does not true , as we have not achieved the officials .
What of the suit ?
The OIT-Gebäude was not only the passengers the NFÜ an open mind , but also the Ministry of Justice and Polizeiwesen , the rather than a Weihnachtsfeier on 7 December the Lucia-Ball there held has .
They had been taken to the Benützung the premises not rent to the OIT pay .
Some 500 visitors came to the ball .
Eröffnet were the revolved with a speech of the Minister , to the Dinner , it Live-Musik to he .
The Question of -LSB-origo-RSB- said it with , It was at the ball not Ballkleid- or Anzugspflicht .
The ministries of health , work , and autonomy for is each time to Puritan mark in .
The Ministry organised the beginning for the people in the their own four Wänden for some 400 000 Forint .
Arbeitsministerin Mónika Lamperth assuming their own staff officially garnicht to a Weihnachtsfeier , but also about the conference to Jahresausklang .
The day with less than 180 guests , the , as the Presseabteilung , only with coffee and Pogatsche bewirtet will , however , it is not only the beginning with 350 Forint from .

The Ministry , PM draft it organised a Weihnachtsfeier in own Festsaal , will be expected to the 436 people .
The money has been done with 2,500 Forint per capita level , for this money is it a Buffet-Empfang with anschließendem possessed .
Since the very beginning the office of János Veres celebrate the staff of PM each year in this way .
There will be no right Party-Stimmung of all doubt , not only for the official speech of the Minister and because the beginning of the afternoon a was .
The Ministry invites on 20 January to a Neujahrs-Empfang , the Weihnachtsfeier of the Ministry is now in place .
We asked the one hundred guests to Palace Vajdahunyad in the Committee Stadtpark ' Városliget ' , the any information the areas are the money with 1 Forint a guest at .
As the Presseabteilung news , however , is it a very simple Stehempfang , to the only in Hungary akkreditierte foreign diplomats called will .
The receptions , which will be awarded each year , start traditionally with a brief speech of the Minister and but with zurückhaltendem Schmausen from .
As the enstprechenden Pressestellen to -LSB-origo-RSB- an oral question speak , is it not the case Aussen- still the Education a Weihnachtsfeier give .
It into account the costs of Weihnachtsfeier could be in the Presseabteilung the Minister not know the people .
In any case were more than 400 guests to mark called , the in Kunstgewerbemuseum organised will .

The fathers of Krautrock never go back
Germany Supergruppe the Siebziger musiziert once again , The three Bandmitglieder of Harmonia , is the Commission 's Konsolen in a chorus in Berlin once again in .
I Revival seems a Mitschnitt from the EU 's most important time ' Live 1974 out .
The time were they in other countries a great deal famous .
The directive sensation taken place is then in Mr President three gesetzter gentlemen to the Abendtafel .
No one has be Kästchen in itself , its cable and in particular its Knöpfe .
Dieter Moebius claim in blütenweißen much with 63 years ' time in the middle .
The political divide accompanied by Mr Rother , 57 years old and in possession of Laptop and Gitarre .
Law , the Auditorium from developing that approach coherently , krümmt is Hans-Joachim Roedelius , 73 concentrated form in which Konsole .
No one is quite in , sometimes even a Beat .
And some cases part it is off to a traditional way music .
I think it also the gentlemen itself not a great deal to disrupt .
The fact the production Harmonia once again musiziert , has in Krautrock-Liebhabern for some excitement taken care of .
Wobei we here reveal should not , The after was , however , that the name is through collective Popgedächtnis schwirrte , but not so the long term , at this link for 32 years difficult to miss .
But why should not also of the Germans of its live myths from the Siebzigerjahren celebrate must ?
All the , and misleading Krautrock is , in the United Kingdom and the United States always more was than in their own country .
Mr President the Musikwirtschaft the survivors the Kölner group Can 2003 the Echo-Preis for Lebenswerk gave , was we in this Chamber in fragende German Popgesichter .
As the Red where Chili Peppers is in the hymn even further in the Bands The Dusseldorf and A new feature , bedankten , was the surprise no borders .
The case Konzerten hockte Michael Rother a later date in the Red where Chili Peppers to the stage as a old Kumpel .
The problem the ignorance us and the Verklärung in the foreign is my first question .
The case is already therefore with Harmonia stressed , however , because the trio was only two years and in this time also a far less Wirkungsmacht got rather than they be added of others were was .
Moebius and Roedelius have had with the artists Conrad Schnitzler advance in the a great deal promise on behalf Cluster musiziert .
Mr President , we in the basement of the Berlin Schaubühne .
The Council in Dusseldorf , for economic reasons for a of the Church unterhaltenes Plattenlabel .
Rother had a few words in plant ausgeholfen and is then as Gitarrist in New . , the time perhaps most radical German group , a reputation erspielt .
In order 1973 has happened since Rother but not the Cluster-Musikanten in exile in accordance Forst in Weserbergland .
It , however , in elderly Weserhof , a Ruine from the 16th century , if it as stadtflüchtige Kommunarden .
Less ideological rather than in the municipal 1 , which is Roedelius still as nanny plagen was .
The in force spitzweghaftem Künstlerdasein .
It was not only in Sperrmüll also a Wimpel the Gesangsvereins Harmonia Ottenstein and in favour of the art a name .
Much was Harmonia it entirely clear .
The first Album the European Central Bank ' music of Harmonia \ '' and the following \ '' De Luxe out .
In fact it by and large the music also reflected , the production litt material need .
The Reisigsammeln was not its own the Selbstfindung .
The now published CD the words ' Live 1974 which was in a chorus in Griessem mitgeschnitten , in a less than a 50-köpfigen Rekordkulisse , how are you to remember believes .
The Rother , at the request , Harmonia to promote and from time to time .
As far Roedelius and Moebius a unsittliche for it .
The chain said 1975 their own separation .
Rother landed in Esoterisch-Sphärischen and pledged to its own existence with Alben as ' Flammende my heart out .
Cluster was in the Achtzigern once again crowded and is since then successful , as it Harmonia the was .
The Griessemer Livealbum is Herbert Grönemeyer to thank for that .
The Plattenfirma Greenland has it is to the objective set , the Krautrock as very German contribution to living music to look after them .
A new feature , was in have then as Roedelius Solowerk .
The physical inauguration of Harmonia will take place in Berlin House of the world 's cultures rather than .
Obviously this support , in the framework of the festivals Woldtronics .
Julian Cope is the time , however , the British , Altpunk and author of Manual ' Krautrock Sampler out .
The fact is also the Loveparade-Erfinder better . Motte .
What the whole range the influence of Krautrocks to the future Popmusik mapped out would be .
The Harmonia will in this respect the entered the Supergruppe management .
The sentence of Brian Eno time with the absonderlichsten Sounds in this Chamber : ' The only real music , however , it is the future . which
There are images , the the producers with Harmonia in the Bauernstube shown once again .

We are the three veterans again with the impromptu action . .
No more , by it Mikrofone to the Orgel and to Schlagzeug kleben , in order the instruments with regard themselves gebastelte Effektgeräte unprecedented going to entlocken .
This is the electronic music such as electronic music from .

In the management Barbara Morgensterns will in Soundwolken gehustet and gewispert and in relation to the following a fine point with Emphase ' Aaaaaaaah , which sang .
Krautrock has been is always a very English term .
It was is not in order implementing .
The roots were less in Blues . , rather than in Musikhochschulen , Can draft it , technology , plant , or on the run in cultural and social conventions , Cluster draft it .
Who here ' '68 ! which is , however , has not quite wrong , and Harmonia on is that even at this late stage not from the peace as well .
The the Selbstverständlichste will on the stage very carefully reviewed .
Where but music to and when said they in official documents

Is the market a Endjahres-Rally before ? differences with regard the experts from the US-Hypothekenkrise
With less than five weeks to the accounts of the stock exchange reiben is the investors with regard to the next Endjahres-Rally already the hands .
However can the experts have not safe forecasts drawn up .
Banif believes , however , that rein at view , of the month of December on the market normally with a positive development is
But is it not advisable , forecasts the short term and only on the basis of statistics to them . In particular will not , if serious to reach tensions the current happening .
Although other experts a such large Kursanstieg in the last weeks of the year not agree , however , do this is to , that der quoted by the been liquidity of the market and the operators certainly will . invest The because of lack of safe Aktienfonds mainly in pension funds , which by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend out to paid assets been hit hard is .
The will according to this experts the market rather than a more lateralen , of instability beeinflussten Kurstrend to , vor than anything because we still do not the extent of the world 's decline of Zinssatzes the US-Notenbank a good idea can , a lack the above all to the increase Rohöl-Preis and the danger of the growth of the inflation due ist . ''
Javier Barrio , chairman the Verkaufsabteilung in BPI in Spain , is true to agree on this , that it a gewagter time is , a forthcoming Markt-Rally to say about it .
Die opportunities are not very much gut '' , said the expert .
The Spanish Aktienindex Ibex has already since his or her Höchstmarke on 8 November of 15.945,7 points a value of 4 lost .
But not all experts agree with the negative opinion .
The view of Juan Mr Solana , analyst in Intermoney , could the Ibex 35 by the restructuring of the Investment and the traditional , each year at this time 's cost of the Caisse , the year working with almost UK points complete .
In spite of this highlights the expert clear , that is this year the things rather differently develop could , above all because the already in the second week , and therefore directly to the Brückentag the day the constitution , which Endjahres-Rally .
According to the analysts would the volatility the Markttendenzen not an effect .
The assessment of Federico Olucha , analyst at the bank Inversis , are engaged in is the previous statement on situation in a more technical level , which could lead to it , dass is about a difference of the Indexwerten there could , however , the extent abhingen of the consequences of US-Hypothekenmarktkrise .
The analyst familiar with them to , that this positive outcome .
In the choose between the values , the the Ibex to new Höchstmaßen forward are , are not only the analysts agree .
Solana of Intermoney claimed , however , that `` dieses year the most important values in the number sind . ''
The the Wert-Gewinnern would be of the expert of the two banks and some Immobiliengesellschaften count , da the Stromsektor at the appropriate time be too expensive wird . ''
Meanwhile said Federico Olucha of the bank Inversis , however , that the Anstiege in connection with the bank of industry step will .
If the Rally is actually taken place , will the Immobiliengesellschaften benefit of it .
`` Die ACS was is in the last few months to Aufholkurs and we hope , however , that other Immobiliengesellschaften as Ferrovial and FCC same way ahead , `` as the expert .
As the high consumption during the Weihnachtstage will In the last half of the periodic use the happening . .

It all used to make want , and what will be for other financial
Stop and go-Verkehr , the car full swing in allmorgendlichen congestion .
For the radio erklingt a strange tune , The blast a Geige , however , combined with electronic effects .
I President the volume higher .
The pace changing , to the so far Klängen is the Bass , and rather than real Klangjuwel a women chorus .
It is the know the word ' Wings of Love out of Zagar , the to mr2 erklingt .
The domestic Musikszene has us for a long time not just spoiled with qualitativem Electropop .
But now , we even the congestion different , if we are doing now the new Album of Zagar said .
The presence of Yonderboi , so many new and exciting production capacity from the domestic digital Underground-Szene are too slowly to a change of Gesamtbildes in , and even if the Garagenrock with his Gitarrengequitsche once again ' in which is , however , the domestic Electropop shows that There are new under the sun .
Balázs Zságer has in Pécs from , however , musizierte even in the production Yonderboi , before it , perhaps , because a pub not two Pfeifer can not , to go his own way began .
The breakthrough with his project , Zagar draft it and its music , the elements from Jazz , Electronic , and the Third International Mathematics verschmilzt , created it but only as we with the request , the Soundtrack to a film to komponieren , to him herangetreten was , z.B .
The word ' Szezon out of Ferenc Török draft it .
The groups , which has been initially in smaller clubs , however , was the broader public only well known , and the journal ' wan2 out their first Album from the year 2002 in the top 50 domestic Alben reihte and Zagar , together with Yonderboi , the almost one , also in the West marktfähigen Trendsetter kürte .
There were Zagar and the country 's production ' trendy which , it interested but not , whether they this brand also like are .
The production has risen , as it should be , In a new , even better Album .
The now published new Album with the title the word ' Can not Walk Fly Instead which could them new to me open , but is already the title the wish to continuity with the Pécser years from .
The fact is after all the time , rather than Balázs Zságer still with another link on his way was .
The luftige , flying contribution would be indeed in order , but not go as well as the essential nature of the music the , the have times changed to this extent and the trends this issue , fair Gitarre , the influence of Rock'n'Roll to .
In this Liedern has is the living in the United Kingdom and with the production of The puzzle out working Sänger György Ligeti in the first in Millenáris presented .
I know the Album has it even to Radioschlager the foreseeable future , the since Neuestem from an early age to late Popmusik sendende mr2 Petőfi has the Hörern with the number ' Wings of Love \ '' , the in participation of six indigenous Sängerinnen , \ '' Underground Divas ' included was , however , causing the Ohrwurm set .
All on other words , ? draft it .
The hvg.hu has with regard Balázs Zságer consulted it .
Hvg.hu , The new Hit raises the question to , What is our music reserved for a certain class ?
Balázs Zságer : the term ' Schichtmusik which means I do not just a great deal .
In my opinion is it two corporate in the Popmusik , and am not mainstream and Underground , or An alternative and the Third International Mathematics , but Kommerziell and honest .
Even the so-called Alternativ- or Underground-Musik can seicht and enough be , however , as the way they and only for produced the sale will , the it to commercial music is .
The a good Pop-Nummer can be created from the original reason .
The realise the Hörers work but also for this principle , of languages and borders independent .
Hvg.hu : Siehst you a difference in the public access the Hungarian and the foreign public your music with regard ?
Example Zs . : In other countries , particularly west of us has the Popmusik a longer tradition behind it .
In fact , not only teenagers or Twens to Konzerte , but also the elderly people .
You follow the trends in the Popmusik , the about it was done , a great deal closely , because they they also to some of the contemporary culture time .
Hvg.hu : What kind of role is the public to in your work ?
Is it important , who , where and how many hear your music ?
Example Zs . , Of course is it a good feeling , to do so , that more and more to our Konzerten come .
We have but not in favour of the market komponiert .
The us is the music not , in order to serve a purpose , but for any particular reason .
The role of the public is the most part in the Konzerten a , where it is already a mutual interaction , but the is it is only in the ungreifbaren changes the ongoing .
In spite of this is me one note : Willst du it all right to make , are you are not interesting .
Hvg.hu : How far möchtest you the example of Yonderboi the same ?
It is rather than Solist on and has his career more in the West set up .
Example Zs . , We are not really its own way , sometimes it very well , that we are once again an attempt , this in our music hineinzuinterpretieren .
We can see us more than Teamplayer , the to the musikalische presence of the other trust and they play it on .
At were of course comparisons of our work with the of Yonderboi lead , when a number of us from its production are and have taken a different way .
Hvg.hu : In the Charts of mr2 Petőfi is the word ' Wings of Love which at centre stage .
Many people have only in connection with this number the name Zagar is .
Was the opening up with a something populäreren more in the right direction of a broader public aware orchestrated ?
Example Zs . , We have had no plans , a Hit to write , the then as Zugpferd for the Album an excuse to do so .
In this song is it to do anymore .
It was a final the Albums was intended , with the we the Klangorgie and the more difficult issues itself would like to .
Hvg.hu : In what way are you the six Sängerinnen selected ?
Why is it , which has been the guidance .
Example Zs . , The idea was , however , a Gospel-artigen chorus to make .
If so , the idea , the chorus from talented Solisten the future Musikszene after all .
For example is the sechsköpfige chorus has been closed , other words Sena , Edina Kutzora , Judie Jay , Bori Péterfy , Enikő Hodosi -LSB-Neo-RSB- , Juci Németh , , the we then apäter a so-called ' Underground Divas which christened have .
Hvg.hu : Wolltest you the song as we have seen , or have it the girls mitgestaltet ?
Example Zs . , The number was it a long time in the Instrumentalversion , but rather than the material on this Album ready has been , thought we us , that this number be ' something needs ' .
The Akkordenabfolge has formally to a Gesangsstimme calling for .
I have the tune the same time in the same night eingesungen , later have they learned the girls .
It , all practical purposes to straightaway and very spontaneous .
I can remember , I was at that time a elektrisiert , but it has already also the ' Divas ' taken place .
In my voice is would the song has become never so great .
Hvg.hu , The to the don , as well as the chorus was we but the impression , the girls would be in The background .
It is not Solo-Part , said the short Solo of Judy Jay draft it , they have no own role , sings perfect and and are not all , however , as the music , is will it Gesang of the music not only with .
In addition to the stage were it back .
Is it will .
B.Zs . , That they have been behind , however , was for purely technical problems as .
We do so we them aware not Solo-Rollen to happen here .
In the number is it also a question , that we be ego a bit the fact is , however , who where has and where agriculture is concerned , let us simply to , that we this particular side , the side of the love emporheben .
I would like , however , that also other this euphorischen state feel , the we felt have , and the song came is .
Hvg.hu : What has been the aufwendigste know ?
Example Zs . , In the musical Schaffensarbeit in fact do not , however , it has more the Mixen difficult tasks there .
For example in the word ' Dorian Gray 's dilemma \ '' , in which I to a Konzertklavier source , or in \ '' Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls ' , where the Groove longer will not work was going to say , but gradually has is all unite , as in a puzzle .
Hvg.hu : What is your Lieblingsnummer by the Committee new Album ?
Example Zs . , The changed is with the Konzerten the whole time and even at this late stage , where I the Album ' losgelasssen which have .
At present are it ' Prophet Is A Fool \ '' , \ '' Escape From The Earth \ '' and the number \ '' Never The Same out .

England faced with the decision taken on the comments of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
The two dilemmas , each one it almost as difficult as the other .
Who is a number 6 for the United Kingdom in Kandy in this weekend , , Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara ?
In addition , no less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka , who will take the decision ?
The second question is important , because David Graveney , the Wahlvorsitzende , to call at least in this particular title , this is , in order the Cheftrainer Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan in to help them to decide , and that is the table of High Morries , the English executive director , starting with candidates for the Member States ' Wählerämter really , if not even for the in Teilzeit .
Who also are not the sixth Schlägerposition about it , will be unfortunate , but the life is often unfair and the sport is it no doubt .
It is never easy , clearly marked , what a human being made possible the top its Berufszweiges to achieve , in any case not on the lowest level succeeding , some cases from lack of success rather than ability .
It is not only in Kricket , where the selection difficult is , where decisions necessary is concerned , which are always subjective at the end .
Is it the right time for Bopara full standing ?
Is it fair to Shah if it is it ?
The same can probably also in a further area this will , however , whether for example John Edwards or ' Tubby which Banerjee , both intelligent young leaders with good qualifications , the the business well know , promoted will should .
Who can say , what the right class to a Kricketspieler is concerned , it is the fact , it is an opportunity , to be prepared and remain .
Of course have figures a major influence on decisions , but we have this also .
The a team must a Kricketspieler the eye of the captain for the right time are , if it a Wicket take can and a thugs must regular opportunities on the order received , if it as a eintägiger Kricketspieler impression to us would like to see .
The eyes of Auswähler to catch is more complicated .
It was a great deal , which in the last season more effectively than , for example , and James Anderson were , the play in the first test apparently will , even if Stephen Harmison themselves for healthy said and as the winds in the networks kegelt .
Anderson , 32 first-class Wickets with the 33 Runs , in order to earn a position in this Tour .
Chris Tremlett , only 29 with the same modest average , but they have had their Glanzpunkte and hope to more than that .
Whether or not Shah or Bopara in Asgiriya stage is , can only a Ansichtsfrage be .
The election could the Karrieren decide both men , and it is perhaps but very little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka , Gareth Batty in every test and has been successful in first , with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs , it was , however , Paul Collingwood , was still kämpfend in order to consolidate itself , the the breakthrough to a very serious Testkricketspieler concerned and the , although it a double hundred against Australia in Australia punktete , perhaps still underestimated will .
It is , however , that Graveney , Vaughan and Moores , to a further discussion as the today 's Netzsitzung in Asgiriya stage their Conservative instincts and Bauchgefühl for Shahs greater experience on Boparas young enthusiasm the same will .
There are arguments for both .
The Shah is the country 's funkelnden and very important 88 Test-Debüt-Innings in Bombay , 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara , the seven years with 22 years younger is , and a good record against angedrehtes bullets .
But Shah was only 10 Runs in his two Innings in May against West Indies in the test at Lord , his or her Heimatarena as a players from Middlesex , and this , plus his immediate rejection of the Auswählern and Vaughan healthy was , in order its position for the next game back , think the momentum from his Would taken to have , the are still in Bombay has been .
On the other hand to has the Alleskönner from Essex schaufelweise Lebensfreude .
It is of no benefit to a Kricketplatz impressed and its position outside of it was on the point been made , and he recently a vehicle with Vierradantrieb in a issue for England sponsor Volkswagen in rapid succession , .
It erlitt minor injuries and I believe a shock , but the first , what he did , however , was be Vodafone , of course also gesponsort draft it so and his Teamkollegen Alastair Cook to , the this from afar , had , and with enthusiasm to say : ' Have you the seen ? ' .
Bopara is a much better Feldspieler , however , he kegelt be Mitteltempo with some effect here on the Spielfeldern , which seems to fit to it and forward with confidence and skill .
To choose The right man is one thing , however , to choose the right time another .
Perhaps this is the real art of the choice .
I tend to Bopara now its opportunity to give , what does not mean , however , that Shah would not but well off will , if , as the Teesatz from Ceylon People , he who is , the here this weekend play will .

The currently ongoing negotiations of the bank with the trade unions seem to an agreement felt , in the 75 % all being Saturday be closed and to in a weekday afternoon opened up , if not even for the Kundschaft .
It is other banks of the new initiative party , which is the Geschäftsöffnungszeiten flexible , will depend bank of the empiricism of the Popular .

Budget is by
Yes , it is managed .
The budget is approved .
What is different in this budget ?
It is the first budget , the raised this government has , and the no longer support of the opposition by the Koalitionsmehrheit which was .
The for the current year was still with support the ČSSD , Social Democrats draft it approved , because it Minister Sobotka , of this party draft it presented had , and the ČSSD it is therefore not possible , , reject it .
The difference to lively debate before the vote on the Misstrauensantrag against the government was this time nothing dramatic about this .
The parliament approved this traditionally less than profile , but most important law in all time .
This is a certain irony .
All good governance begins and ends with the various chapters and part of the budget , whether one like it or not .
The budget is an important part of politics , is but because of the struggle of the government and the opposition .
The is in favour of the media a dankbareres issue , and therefore to it him more attention .
The conflict in politicians is to the public more interesting as a cold figures .
The budget litten in the past Socialist governments in three weaknesses , the of the budget for the year 2008 not eliminate at once is concerned ,
The first is the high level of expenditure , the of law on compulsory are , however , and it is not only to the pensions are concerned , but also to social , the the ' quiet ' coalition of ČSSD and KSČM , communists draft it in last year before the elections decided has .
The second is the other budget as a result of the first Schwachpunkts .
The third reduction is in the growth of public finances , which the deficits of the communities .
The greatest risk is , however , not the public deficit .
This budget is made public and eingermaßen under control .
A real bomb is but the deficit of the communities .
The Mayor said , in order but revenue from taxes , social security contributions and Bankkrediten other sources of investment to explore , often were bonds from , giving it its own councils in excessive debts .
In the last few years managed it them , this debt by mass sale of shares of energy and other Versorgungsnetze , the it in the train of the privatisation of State they had , pay .
It is the source as soon extinguished .
We are not only to formal and verifiable facts our opinion , are we see , that ,
Our economy has for a number of years , as the rest of the world , a growth is , which is the ČSSD without permanently praised .
It was a unique opportunity for their governments of this , to bring the public finances in order .
Instead indebted the governments the State , however , more .
Others , quite apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary , Albania , Pakistan and Egypt , have a great deal more economical as the Republic .
This is a Riesenschande , the high the previous governments to is concerned .
We are to the Member States , which , seen on a global level , least of poverty at risk are .
We are not nassiven Sozialprogramme this situation , which unfortunately is in the most recent years as it stands itself in huge scale aufgeblasen were .
Even if it has been achieved is , some the absurd populist spending , which were adopted this year in the elections , to be deleted , is clear , that if it in the future not to postpone the debate the retirement age and to a pension reforms is , then end in any policy in this country , and , no matter who in power is , is it not rather than pure Verwalten remain .
It is only slightly too far , if you say , that it from ruling politicians officials will , the the lion 's share of the taxes automatically to pensions and social share .
That is the year 's budget be no revolution , but can only of the minority of normal expenditure by Pflichtausgaben stop .
The for 2008 provided for deficit of 70 billion kroner would be a surplus , if previous governments did not spent in the last decade have , what is more , .
If we do not want to say that it really to is , that from current politicians a Verwaltungsbeamte will , we must we be patient and the not too strong government , which is but well aware of that is , that the State only so much money can , as it in taxes and charges a in the situation is , and in the preparation other Reformgesetze want .
Only this will allow a gradual implementation of a balanced budget .

What kind of insurance is to find the best ?
The KFZ-Versicherung , the a caused by the driver the world 's forth covers , is a very high costs , which level wiederrum of various factors on , one of age , sex , time the drawing up of Führerscheins , Familienstand , some kind of to versichernden cars and its use , and so on .
To have A car is just the beginning .
In fact it is even more difficult the good KFZ-Versicherung to find a the right Fahrzeugmodell .
First of all is a clear be , what we have to do it here .
A Autoversicherung is an agreement between a Versicherungsgesellschaft in addition to a number .
This agreement will be written by a Versicherungsvertrags recorded , the states , that the civil society the agreed Versicherungsprämie will and in return the commitment is , in a forth the this matter Abfindungssumme present .
The Versicherungsprämie is the price of insurance , the is by several factors made up , among other things . age , sex , time the drawing up of Führerscheins , Familienstand , some kind of to versichernden vehicle or its use .
The insurance companies set their own prices in the statistics say , and in a higher risk also higher contributions earlier will .
For this reason we should have both on 25-Jährige and women make more contributions , as statistics show , however , that these groups with their caution a lower Unfallquote to .
The same applies also to married people , because this according to the statistical values and therefore also to that of the companies , to less accidents tend as Alleinstehende .
The We , the the vehicle attached will , an adverse effect the frequency of Fahrens and it also the likelihood of an accident .
The more the use , the more likely the damage .
With regard to the establishment of the premium must the insurance a number of points into account .
For this reason must also the drivers the situation very carefully study , in order exactly what the Autoversicherung environment , the his personal needs best response .
We listen to this point now the most important points to , which we should take into account in terms of selecting a insurance , in order not only a strong , but also a preisorientierte election taken to can .
The in 11 % taken in the election of a cheap insurance in a number of obstacles , as for example the small Fahrpraxis and the junge '' specific .
Even if it for a perfect insurance the best would be , a Vollkaskoversicherung a successful conclusion , is it still cheaper alternatives .
The cautious drivers can the one hand Vollkasko with Selbstbeteiligung choose , and the services a Vollkaskoversicherung is covered , but at a low price offer will .
This type of Treaty is , however , that the consumer must pay some of the amount created by the damage himself .
`` Der amount will in a successful conclusion of the Treaty and on the total amount of Versicherungsprämie established . This is higher the lower the to bezahlende Summe '' , said Luis Noguera , Council Spain in First Europe , a Vermittlungsunternehmen for Online-Versicherungen .
Another option is the more extensive insurance , the the customers against external Unfallschäden assured us of this , but not against the on their own car has been created damage .
In addition would this type of insurance theft , fire and Fahrzeugverlust cover .
The a Council .
If you are old in 25 years , is it in your hand , the insurance costs to a very low level , it increased to accept Gutschrift , by you versuchst , careful to travel and accidents can be prevented .
A Gutschrift is a reduction of five in the this matter Versicherungsgesellschaft .
On the contrary to is a Strafzahlung a question tariff increase .
`` Die how high credits and Strafzahlungen are of the society and its return from .
If the company a ertragsreiches year behind it has , however , can it is possible , the Bonus-Zahlungen to erhöhen '' , set out Noguera .
Once the 25-Jahre-Marke goes beyond that is , is it for the drivers simple a Treaty completed . The reason for this is the fact , however , that with increased Fahrpraxis the Unfallquote falling .
This is it the sinnvollsten , are in favour of a Vollkaskoversicherung with Selbstbeteiligung to decide .
`` Normalerweise can the young people will not benefit from their previous experience from , both in the event of an accident as well as the timing of Fahrens nicht '' , set out the Spanish Vorsteher the European company , and adds a further point , that the majority of the accidents is in second Praxisjahr happen , after the Angst the Anfängers '' question was .
In spite of this is it in a married customers , who has no children , ratsamer , a Vollkaskoversicherung complete , of course be , if it the financial situation the appropriate person also allows .
The the companies as well as couples with children and the customers with the lowest Unfallquote , and therefore low are also their contributions from .
In this case would be a Vollkaskoversicherung with Selbstbeteiligung , in a amount to the 300 available draft it the best option . In case that we a high Gutschrift they has , , is a more extensive insurance , the only the third Fahrzeugjahr place .
`` Sie driving as a whole entspannter and have a greater purchasing power , the it them the floor , a greater contribution anzusetzen '' , is Luis Noguera said .
For retired people is it is to , a Vollkaskoversicherung with Selbstbeteiligung , in a amount to the 150 euro draft it , or a wider insurance a successful conclusion , the only in a sufficiently high Gutschrift place .
In must be quite clear , however , that the Autoversicherung something very important is , not only , because it the drivers against possible Unfallschäden protect , and , because it high costs is , which it must , however , that a fundamental choice made will , which is our personal situation .

The are not Warhols amounts
Who the terms Sweden and Holzkiste to , your view to Ikea , but not to Andy Warhol .

At present situation in Sweden fabrizierte Holzkisten dark shadow on Warhols Werkverzeichnis .
Many the vierundneunzig over there listed Brillo-Boxen the expression ' type the Stockholm Summit which are counterfeit products .
After the Swedish newspaper ' Expressen \ '' a few months ago doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxen of the year 1968 campaign has , however , come from internal investigation in Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a ernüchternden result , The six \ '' Brillo-Boxes \ '' , the the former Museumsdirektor Pontus Hultén the Moderna Museet In 1995 and Schenkung vermacht has , are copies , and no doubt also the majority of some one hundred other Brillo-Boxen the \ '' type Stockholm out , the to the international art into are .
The history is verschachtelt , however , a confusion following artistic and kuratorischer production .

The issue his work in the Committee Moderna Museet 1968 , , with Warhols agreement , hundreds of Brillo-Kisten from Pappe from , which were , from the costs involved draft it not of Warhol , but were directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik make .
It was is not about art , but about the Role models , to just Ausstellungsstücke .
At the same time has Warhol 1968 no doubt the permission the area , a few Brillo-Holzkisten produce in Sweden . , the but not in Moderna Museet issued were .
All witness are now of about 15 amounts , the time and authoritative Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name ' type the Stockholm Summit out to right in the art and Auktionsgeschichte received are .
Some of them have reached more than 100 dollars in auctions .
The problem is now , however , that the legendary Museumsdirektor Pontus Hultén later that said has , it are 1968 some one hundred Holzkisten in Sweden produced and issued been , the Warhol him then to it have .
The were Hulténs 105 amounts the first place In 1990 in members for an exhibition in St Petersburg produced .
At the time was Warhol the past three years dead .
Mr Byström , Chefkonservator the Moderna Museet , has as well as the six museumseigenen Brillo-Boxes also three from Swedish privately owned under investigation , of which two 1968 in Stockholm made were : the honourable Member 's Pressspanplatten were the first place grundiert and abgeschmirgelt , then was white Ölfarbe with a Pinsel functions .
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 against displays , however , that the show with a Malerrolle without Grundierung directly to the Pressspanplatte functions was , also is it is not to oil , but in order Acrylfarbe .
' This amounts have been did not authorised by the artists and should of the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes removed will \ '' , is the director the Moderna Museet , Mr Nittve , said , \ '' If the 'Andy Warhol some kind Authentication Board ' in New York not to another an end is , will the Moderna Museet the six amounts in its collection and Kopien/Ausstellungsmaterial sorting through it . which
The in July 2001 , has the Authentication Board announced , the ' very serious allegations which up , the on the Seifenpulver-Kisten be restored .

The Hypermarkets in Budaörser Handelsgebiet have also this year the average increase of other by the last year continue , with the difference , however , that it this year not increase the VAT was .
Article go far enough Napi Gazdaság
In Budaörser Handelsdreieck has the price of commonly accepted Weihnachtskorbes the ' Napi which also this year to 16 percent increase , but not have been made in all Hypermärkten prices of with regard thousand HUF registered .
Just when the prices in the Lebensmittelmärkten in last December ' davongaloppiert which are , however , is the people prozentuell not been billion , compared with the already high , former Ausgangsniveau .
Of course , it on the consumers certainly a deterrent , that the , for which it last year go on condition nine HUF paid had , this year not even for 10 000 . HUF available is .
The price of the word ' Napi which Warenkorbs überschritt the magic 10.000-HUF-Grenze to at least 91 HUF in the examined markets .
The high price , 10.573 HUF .

The prices for Unicum and living fish left more or less to Vorjahresniveau , has risen sharply are the other hand the prices for Putenbrustfilets , Nuss and poppy .
Prices for meal and bread took the data of the Central Statistical office of Hungary , in Auchan , it , however , 1kg Brotwecken for 139 Forint .
It was the product not wettbewerbsbedingten prices on in more than 200 Forint .
The surprise has been here the price a two litre Coca-Cola Pfandflasche of less than 200 Forint , therefore took the drinks including Pfand only 257 HUF .
In spite of this schnitt of the year in ' Napi which Warenkorbs-Vergleich Auchan the most expensive , and Cora the best from .
Our calculations have shown , however , that Cora the prices in the word ' Napi which Warenkorb to the Weihnachtspreisen last year to 15 while Tesco and Auchan each to 18 percent increase have .
The difference between the cheapest Warenkorb the last year and the most expensive of this year , 12 % , while the increase between billigstem Warenkorb of the last year and teuerstem of this year 21 % distinguished .
The average rise was 1.480,00 HUF .
The average increase was in the year so far in 1.206,00 Forint , however , is the VAT impact on the prices on last Christmas .
That this matter has the trade been taken , I have the supermarkets is not the case right decision , the Preisspanne they use in the various articles are , because the effects of the increase in the purchasing behaviour immense were .
, If the dealers the circulation of a product bad planning , can he to most important profits fall in the Preisspanne , which is to the Verkehrsintensität is . draft it

This year were such extremes not seen , as the most expensive basket in order 1.630,00 Forint more cost , rather than last year , and even the cheapest was it a rise of 1.284,00 Forint .
In that respect the two last Weihnachtssaisons was is a catastrophic increase , the price of a daily basis Verbrauchsartikel in the Hypermärkten is in less than 20 months to more than 30 percent increase .
, This is true not necessarily the data of the Central Statistical office of Hungary , The some basic foodstuffs , the statistical office in the period of 12 months a more than 30-prozentige people see .
For example in such as well as meal also in eggs . draft it
Is it , however , a look in the ' Napi which Warenkorb , seems this in who more or less impossible , because the prices of already last year expensive product itself at worst to not more than 10 percent increase is .
It is a Mehllieferanten in a stronger position , rather than the Eilieferanten , at least , they pass the drastic increase in the multinationals .
The gold Handelsdreieck why is the Hypermärkte not , It will be a continual basis of good years reported .
Our experience shows , however , that the majority of the customers in the three Warenhäusern no longer on the prices well .
It will in the first instance large amounts requested , consistent food are in Paletten on the Ladentische .
Wednesday morning , it in all three Warenhäusern endless queue in the Kassa , rather than a the number of the customers exploded .
Of course is the country a less Kundenfrequenz reported , so are many multinationals in the Meinungsforschern why , they could not even the planned turnover achieve , and it does not only in food , but also in sustainable consumer products .

Six deterrent things , in order colleagues to angry
E-mails , which we forget that abzuschicken , Sprachnachrichten , which we never received any , harmless lies , the us no longer auffallen , you put forward ' paint out in the day at work .
The question is working , whether it is in this small receiving used , or is it is more effectively the challenge and an attempt this playing , for other annoying situation account to vermweiden .
Tipps .
' Sorry , I have forgotten you line , however , that some of the Marketing-Abteilung called has out , said a Mr .
The fact we by a meeting failed has ?
This regrets we it and tried it once again organise , by it may in the Marketing-Abteilung phone and reumütig suggests , we should have been ignored , the news line , the is the less traditional method draft it .

Yesterday was the Heftgerät still on the desk , this morning is it no longer ?
Or will the lost an Kugelschreiber more or less on the desk of a colleagues discovered ?
I ask my view it is not of the Members ausleihen , because they are used anger , if they say , however , that something weggekommen is .
In other words , not Kuverts and Post-its from the office in the funds are , because it could a even taken , none left , as long man 's but urgent needs .
Getratsche on the life of the Members ?
There are no effective means , a Tratsch , the has already been set in the world was , stop .
Who with who , which made ?
Where and why ?
We should the information , or suspicion draft it on the life of the Members that , if possible , not everyone in the heart ' .
And as long are they are open and we be innerstes secret displays , should we of the confidence not use .
Most we keep quiet as a grave , rather than the is not present conflict , even if others on the problems of the Member also know where they stand .
Without good reason ill reported .
If we in office phone , in order is under appeal to quälende shape ill to speak , because we are very uncomfortable an awkward position , or is simply however Mr President , should we will be clear about one thing : The own work , essential Erledigungen , projects with firm deadlines must now the House rather than a even do .
The Members is not only at play .
If we have the previous know , however , that we it the next day not to office set up will , or that something dazwischenkommen could , and we remain at home must , should be it in speak , it not the Members , still the head will be faced unexpectedly with the absence .
Gesumme , however , Gekicher , Telefonieren
It is just strengthened in its work , however , is but a the be Gekicher the , off ?
Ungewollt a telephone mitgehört , however , that we better not would listen to ?
It should be the Members do not with money , Singen , be talks , which we on their heads and is draft it , Getrampel , dauerndem Schimpfen or Nörgeln nerven .
All this is very disturbing be , even if they do not just in a task of writing , are planning , organise , monitor are .
Are all the other bad .
Is a project not time ready , has be an important one letter or important Nachrichte forget abzuschicken , should be the responsibility of its own people not seek in others .
The possibility should we are not in the chaos in the Bureau or the what Mr ausreden .
The best way we admits to his mistakes a , and apologies are , however , if others also affected were .
The issue , as we the mistake again the lost ground , or the Versäumte up can , is simply too good .
In office , a feeling as at home ?

Richard Gere is quite simply not cynical enough
The ' The Hunting Party \ '' and \ '' Mörderischer peace which deal with is once again two films with the Balkans .
But they do not .
The the ideas put to a great deal to Action and Geballer or but they are to rührselig .
In fact can also Richard Gere in ' The Hunting Party which no avail .
The good news first : Of course hide is the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still in the mountains of the Balkans , but it there , in that base the Bosnien-Krieges , is now the Schauspieler Richard Gere has been reflected .
We have had the best man the Achtzigerjahre most recently from the eyes lost , because too many nett-belanglose roles in Wohlfühlfilmen for women and far too many press conferences on Buddhism a the desire to come austrieben .
This is Richard Gere a the most important point , is ' The Hunting Party , If the hunters to Gejagten will ' , Why we should have title this is always so long and wirr be as Lokführer-Tarifverträge ? draft it may after all see .
It is a great augenzwinkernde we , In fact a great deal is be Kriegsreporter Simon Hunt the , which from Gere would be able to , if the fate and the Filmbranche less gnädig would be : A man , the its very best these days long behind is has , the but even as ruinengleiches Denkmal his decline still a great deal left the former Charmes , has .
But despite this Trumpfes , ' The Hunting Party \ '' put together with the German production \ '' Mörderischer peace out , the also in the course of this week starting , only the endless number gescheiterter Balkankriegs-Filme continue .
The ' Mörderischer peace which can be very brief process to make , The film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo , Adrian Topol , Max Riemelt draft it , the a Serbin in Kosovo Heckenschützen save , which is The first promptly even further in they love .
Although it a good idea is , that here again not the Serbs and only at all evil presented will , losing to the fernsehflache film too quickly in Geballer and Action .
It is a kind of alarm for Cobra 11 which no longer motorway but for with war .
However , is to ' The Hunting Party which is an action , however , why it is never a right good Balkan-Kriegsfilm there has .
The history of three US-Kriegsreportern , which is analysis , however , in order the Serbian Oberkriegsverbrecher ' the Fuchs \ '' identify , had been with a other orchestrator and another Drehbuchautor , both in Personalunion Richard Shepard draft it to another time maybe a new \ '' Apocalypse Now which will be able to .
After all the stories like it is diverse , Both times are small teams in the forest , in order something to people , and the military no longer can and both times will be a visit in the situation .
One of the reasons for the failure of ' The Hunting Party which is , however , that we Simon Hunt no the purpose with cynic heart be is , as the he us at the beginning which will .
No , the Script must him which not only a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin andichten .
Endgültig is ' The Hunting Party which will be that the go off , if the reporters in the last five minutes in Zeitrafferverfahren the can , which NATO , CIA and all Kopfgeldjäger the world in five years ' time failed have : The war are and the Muslim Bosnians to fair revenge to it .
This is so bad , that we the International Criminal Court in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik Justice would .
It has of the film a very human issue .
It would condemn , however , that Karadzic and Mladic still free rumlaufen , and he suspected the Americans and the French people , this should it is for all be in agreement , the persecution by secret political agreements not too hard to do .
But the good Gemeinte and the evil are not only sometimes it the same lines , that a a berühmtes Brecht-Gedicht in the sense is .
In other words it on the Holzmaske a Asian Dämons to the Arbeitstisch of the poet : ' Mitfühlend see I the geschwollenen Stirnadern , andeutend , just how tough it is , however , have to be out .
Films as ' The Hunting Party which have exactly what this Schwellköpfe , the but suggesting , how tough it is , a good thing to .
The problem is not to the Genre of Balkankriegsfilms quite limited .
The other day is in this newspaper related been , that all Irak-Filme Hollywoods major Flops were .
No one can say that It has also never a good Südafrika-Film taken place .
Almost always is : When is a Star on the conflicts or Minenfeldern of the world herumtreibt , it is such a thing in out as ' Rangoon \ '' with Patricia Arquette , \ '' above all borders \ '' with Angelina Jolie or \ '' blood diamonds out with Leonardo DiCaprio .
It is all the conflicts in time simply have to close .
It had at least several decades before , before Hollywood with ' Schindlers list which a good film on the holocaust see was .
Some film will no doubt still be , the now current as a classic Vietnam-Werke ' The Deer Hunter \ '' , \ '' Apocalypse Now \ '' and \ '' Full Metal jacket which are time is not everyone agrees as masterpieces celebrated been .
But will I know we today , where everyone mass murder in real time to just two Bildschirme at is , also just too much on the conflicts of the world .
In addition the raubt the Drehbuchschreibern the Bedenkenlosigkeit , which it needs , in order to tell good stories .
' His and non-democracy \ '' or \ '' The great dictator which are after all , and therefore less has become , because Lubitsch and Chaplin still do not know , however , how bad the Naziregime really was .
It must be not be good would like , if you will make good films .
It must be the ironically distant Künstlerblick the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk have said .
As the to parallels between his historical novel ' Lemprières dictionary \ '' and the Balkans are being asked was , said it : ' It is only to , that are some things never change .
Cities are always very dangerous be , however , people are killed in horrifying way always be and always will war in Yugoslavia is . \ ''

Klaus recalled that he had not klimatologe , but he said that in his view , adequate conditions for such a book to write .
He was finally academics , capable , professional pamphlets to understand and to judge have experience with statistics and economist , too .
The main thrust of the book , he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing , and that his changes therefore quite natural that it on global warming is not being the consensus among scientists , that the consequences of the current changes not too big and seriously and thus are not a threat , and that the efforts , the development of climate , useless , ineffective and unacceptable expensive .

Political capital : Staatsrisiko increased Hungarian GUARD
According to the Department for Risk Analysis ( risk Analysing division ) of political capital , the activities of this August , with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary `` formed Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects .
In the `` Risikowarnungs-Bericht '' of the institute says , among other things , that , in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard , the highest political risk , `` the tightening of existing ethnic tensions between Gypsy and Nicht-Zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary , even in the short term to violent ethnic clashes could lead. ``
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard , which probably at the provocation of this conflict , such as the one .
As has been reported , this will be a failure on the part of the political leaders : `` People seen in public life , the discussion of the Roma issue representatives of radical political groups , which now has its political strategy on the Roma-Ungarn-Gegensatz have built . ''
It is believed that this is the problem , the sensible dialogue impossible , injuries , and the likelihood of violent clashes would increase .
The Forschungsinsitut ausserdem believes the activities of the Hungarian guard , not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media , `` the image of Hungary abroad substantial damage , particularly in terms of confidence in the stability and democratic maturity is concerned . ''
We remember that since the autumn of 2006 , the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary steadily on the rise , so since the summer of 2007 , `` Selbstverteidigungsverein '' national organisations were set ablaze .
`` These groups share the common characteristic of each define a civil organisation , while you open going to claim that its members - sometimes prepare armed - defence tasks ( civil defence , defence , Ordnungshütung ) , invoking the ineffectiveness of the police , the Army , or the state itself , '' it said .
It continues : all of this is in accordance with the method tried , several of Parteiverdrossenheit policies and the peoples ' political aspirations as civil initiative to disguise .
The emphasis on the civilian character and Vereinsform are not merely the circumvention of legal hurdles in the process of registration could appear in court - it is also a political strategy .
As the analysis suggested that the activities of risikoerhöhenden Hungarian guard a factor for relations with neighbouring states .
`` In recent months , the Hungarian guard in several of its neighbours as a potential source quoted some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighbouring sees the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own Anti-Ungarn-Politik .
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region , `` it said .
From the point of view of the institute is the creation of the Hungarian guard Zentral-Ost-Europa no entry in , so the political risk for the entire region .
As has been reported that the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian National Guard , whose founding in August 2007 from the extreme right-wing Bulgaria BNU National Union ( ) .
In the light of the emergence of Bulgarian guard Roma-Massenausschreitungen were in a built-up areas of Krasna Poljana ( Sofia ) .
The BNU has the facts straight to the source of the founding of the National Guard , with the argument that the aim of the Organization of the `` national protection . ''
In their view , was in the past 17 years Zigeunerterror a veritable `` significantly '' in Bulgaria , the government has , however , remained inactive and indifferent , as political capital .
And further : the initiative had a heated debate in the Bulgarian public opened up .
As I said , the increased risk for ethnic conflict is also shown by the fact that some Roma-Organisationen of Bulgaria announced Widerstandszwecken to their own guards .
Since the activities of the Hungarian guard many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard , shows , it is not impossible that the Hungarian Roma with whom to organize their own protection , on the threats , according to the Risikowarnungsbericht of political capital .
Forschungsdirektor Attila Juhász , said in political capital on question of the nachrichtenbüros : the analysis is one of the activities of the Forschungsinstitutes .
Risikoanalyseberichte would be published annually , and if risikoverändernden tendencies will be public opinion informed , as in the case by the publication of the Risikowarnberichtes .

Budget is through
Yes , it is .
The budget is approved .
What is it about this budget special ?
It is the first budget that this government has drafted , and without the support of the opposition by the Koalitionsmehrheit was adopted .
For the current year , even with the support of the ČSSD ( Social Democrats ) because it approved Sobotka minister ( the party ) had presented ČSSD , and therefore could not afford to reject it .
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government was nothing dramatic about this time .
The Congress of Deputies , approved this traditionally little noticed , but the most significant act calmly .
This is a certain irony .
Everything governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget , whether we like it or not .
The budget is an integral part of politics , but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition .
This is for the media dankbareres the issue , so you devote more attention to him .
A dispute among politicians in public is much more interesting than sober figures .
The budgets were among the last Socialist governments under three weaknesses in the budget for the year 2008 can eliminate all at once .
The first is the high proportion of expenditure , the legitimately binding , and it is not only the pensions , but also social spending , `` the implicit ' ČSSD coalition and KSČM ( communists ) last year before the elections .
The second is the budget policy as are basic shortages of Schwachpunkts .
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances , i.e. , the budget deficits of the communities .
The greatest risk is not the state budget deficit .
This budget is publicly and eingermaßen under control .
A real time bomb is the budget deficit of communities .
Many mayors in order but revenue from tax , levies and bank credit other sources of investment , often foolhardy Bond , through its halls in excess indebted .
In recent years , they succeeded , the debt by massive selling shares of energy and other networks in the train of privatization of state had received pay .
Now , the source said grinding to a halt .
As far as we are only at official and verifiable facts , we note that :
Our economy for several years , as the rest of the world is going through a period of the ČSSD vaunted sponsors .
This was a unique opportunity for their governments , public finances in order .
Instead , these governments indebted to the state of even more .
Other countries , apart from a few exceptions , such as Hungary , Albania , Pakistan or Egypt , have spent much more sensible than our republic .
This is a great shame , mainly the previous governments .
We are among the countries which , on a global scale , the least of poverty are threatened .
A nassiven programmes , which are unfortunately just in the last few years in cleaning up unnecessarily were blown out .
Even if it succeeded in achieving a part of the nonsensical populist spending , which this year before the elections were adopted , it is clear that in the near future to an increase in the retirement age and a pension reform , then ends virtually any policy in this country , and regardless of who is in power , he will remain a purely run .
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that officials from ruling politicians , which is the largest portion of tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social spending .
Therefore , this year 's budget is not a revolution , but can only the sweeping Pflichtausgaben normal expenditure .
The scheduled for 2008 deficit of 70 billion kronor would have been quite superfluous in previous governments in the last ten years had spent only .
If we do not want it really comes down to that ruling politicians mere administrators , then we have to be patient and not too strong coalition government , but which are aware that the state is just so much to spend , as he in taxes and fees to occupy the calm in preparing further reform laws .
Only they allow a gradual implementation of a balanced budget .

Lehmann Brothers cut its Profitkalkulation recently in station Telecinco for this year at 4 % and for 2009 at 7 % .
This is the result of cutting the projected growth rate of the Euro 2008 at 10.5 % to 8.4 % and 2009 of 5.5 % to 5.1 % decrease .
This is the likely Gewinnberechnung of Antena 3 for 2008 and to 4.5 percent by 2009 by 7.5 % respectively .
Three options .

His lawyer , the matter but probably not over and his client will appeal .
`` The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team Bolek in the Polívkas parasitär popularity , '' said Polívkas after the trial lawyer .
All were in the Walachisches Kingdom ' , ' the actor and comedian .
The same believe , is Harabiš .

Fund-raising and concepts of activities , `` he said .
According to him , is the point of dispute over money .
`` After years you have noticed that the project is successful and that you could have something out of it .

Lucrative business
According to the court , Polívka used the name `` Walachischer king '' for the first time in one of his television shows .
In 1993 , krönte Radoslav him the actors ' Brzobohatý .
But then this was not the intention , a fiktives kingdom .
A few years later , Harabiš came to the idea that walachische passports .
From an original facetious action emerged clearly from a business and entrepreneurial activity , Harabiš then with the establishment of the Walachisches Kingdom `` table . ''
In 1997 , Polívka agreed to the use of his name and his signature in the passports and even offered their owners reductions for the visit he and his Theatervorstellungen farm .

Kartenhaie
The Kreditkartenmarkt America 's credit crisis ?
If blood in the water , it is , of course , Rückenflossen herumwirbeln that criticism .
Now that America 's ailing real estate market , have Kreditkartenmarkt the Predators in the attack .
Analysts from Goldman Sachs are counting on the Kreditkartenverluste 99 billion dollars could achieve , if the risk of infection from under-funded loans to other forms of Verbrauchenkrediten .
Signs of tension is evident .
There have been increases in both the Ausbuchungen and Säumnisraten in the proportion of loans , einziehbar each No or more than 30 days too late .
The HSBC has announced last month that they have a 1.4 billion dollars charging Verbraucherfinanzierungen for their American , partly because of the Kreditkartennehmern weakness of .
Nevertheless , it is too early to panic .
Losses and Säumnisse are still low .
According to the rating agency Drittquartals-Säumnissrate Moody was 3.89 % of nearly a full percentage point below the historical average .
The deterioration in the advice is partly explained by technical factors .
A change in the American Privatinsolvenzrechtsgesetzen in 2005 led to a sharp fall of Konkursanmeldungen , which in turn a Keditkartenverluste large proportion of the population ; the number of applications ( and thus Säumnisgebühren ) would return , whether the general conditions to deteriorate borrowers or not .
The industry also reports on solid Zahlungsraten to show how much of their debt each month , consumers abbezahlen
And confidence in kreditkartenbasierte securities is quite strong , despite the immobility in other corners of the structured financing .
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup , a research companies , calculated that the Ausgabemengen for 2007 will ultimately be 25 % higher than last year .
Direct Infektionskanäle between the Immobilienkreditkrise and the Kreditkartenmarkt , there is no doubt that it is likely that consumers Kreditkartenschulden include Eigenheimkredite , now that dry up .
But the issuers of cards look at the money Kapitalwerte Instead , so Hauspreise is empowered to resolve not necessarily a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers .
You can even for the issuers of cards .
The incentives for consumers , the hypothekenraten will continue to fall when the assets are worth more than the value of the loan ; as a result , Kartenschulden are among the Rückzahlungsprioritäten important .
Issuers of cards can also much faster and more flexible as a lender to the stürmischeren conditions respond by seizing interest rates or kreditgrenzen .
This should , in theory , the risk of rapid revaluation of assets .
`` We will wake up one day and the loans completely re-evaluate , '' says Gary Perlin , Hauptfinanzreferent Capital ones .
Even if Unterdeckungskrise in a sudden Kreditkartenmarkt is unlikely , there are the risks of a sustained downturn much real .
Hauspreise if lower and a Kreditminderung America into recession will push the industry is facing a grimmigeren future .
Do you think further afield for these fins .

These are not Warhols boxes
Who the concepts of Sweden and Holzkiste , thinks of Ikea , but not to Andy Warhol .
Or is it ?
Now throw Holzkisten them , manufactured in Sweden Warhols dark shadow over Werkverzeichnis .
A large part of the vierundneunzig Brillo-Boxen listed in the `` type of Stockholm '' are forgeries .
Once the Swedish newspaper 'Expressen ' , a few months ago , questioned the Warhols authenticity of Andy Brillo-Boxen of the Year in 1968 , stirred up Moderna internal investigations in Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result : the six Brillo-Boxes `` ' that former Museumsdirektor Pontus Moderna Museet Hulthén 's that put vermacht in 1995 and are copies - and I think the majority of Brillo-Boxen around one hundred others from the '' type of Stockholm , `` on the international art market .
The verschachtelt is a puzzling string kuratorischer artistic and production .
1964 Warhol created in New York , his first Brillo-Boxes `` Holzkisten , '' bemalte , rot-blau-weißen at the design of Seifenpulvers cardboard boxes of `` Brillo `` .
An exhibition of Moderna his work on Museet 1968 was Warhols - with the agreement , hundreds of Brillo-Kisten from cardboard : these were ( spurned by Warhol ) but were directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik holidays .
It is not works of art , but their role models merely exhibits .
At the same time Warhol 1968 has probably given permission to a few Brillo-Holzkisten in Sweden to produce , although not issued Moderna Museet .
Eye witnesses are now talking about 15 boxes , then the Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes as authorized by the name of the 'type of Stockholm ' right to Auktionsgeschichte and the arts .
Some of them have at auction more than 100 000 dollars .
The problem is that Museumsdirektor the legendary Pontus Hulthén 's misrepresented later said that there are around one hundred Holzkisten 1968 in Sweden produced and issued the Warhol , leaving him then .
Indeed , Hulténs 105 cases in Malmö until 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg .
At that point , Warhol was already three years dead .

The election of the status quo
On Sunday , when it comes to the counting of ballot not exciting : the bulk of the Russians will support for President Putin 's party , United Russia .
After a very abgeriegelten campaign confirms her quest for stability , or even to authoritarianism .
Three days before the parliamentary elections is the Russian President Vladimir Putin on ausgestrahlte public television news to the electorate which have already been recorded , whose content is kept secret .
He does so in his capacity as front-runner of United Russia , the Pro-Kreml-Partei , which is a huge victory .
Yesterday , the president has not indicated when he visits by foreign ambassadors , and gave itself a new start against the Western powers , to give us the interference of his pet subjects - during the election campaign .
 We know the price of a genuine democracy and we hope that honest elections , very transparent and open elections without `` fraud , he added .
From the perspective of the opposition did you lost .
She derides as a befleckten campaign of repression .
The Guennadi Ziouganov Communist leaders say  , it would have never been so dirty elections , not even in the `` Eltsin time .
The repression of demonstrations last weekend , Ex-Schachweltmeister applies Garry Kasparovder for illegally demonstrating to five days in prison was sentenced , according to Besuchsverbot to his lawyer .
The Russians have  the mentality of Homo Sovieticus `` preserves
After the parliamentary elections without suspense raise two much broader questions :
 Who is Putin 's successor as president ?
The Amtszeitung yesterday , the date of the first round of the presidential elections announced , 2 March 2008 ; the candidates have to 23 December time .
Since he was elected in 2000 and 2004 has been re-elected , Vladimir Putin , not for a third mandate in consequence .
And now there is no successor .
What role will Putin following March ?
Prime Minister ?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia , the government and president will ?
Whatever it is , in the parliamentary or in the presidential elections , the power is triumphant .
It is tradition .
The Russians have  the mentality of Homo Sovieticus , they are not masters of their own destiny `` , says the sociologist Goudkov Lev , director of the independent Levada centre .
Nikolai Kopossov historians from the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further : civil society in this country , the five centuries after christianisiert , Europe has been slow to develop ; the famous Spirit , the development of individuality delayed .
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s , Putin back on the model of a paternalistic state of continuity , of the people fully adopted , all the more so because at these new paternalism , not terrorism , but a certain economic prosperity , says Maria by the carnegie-stiftung Lipman .
Today , ``  from  the Russians freely on the personal responsibility `` following the collapse of the USSR short-lived displayed .
As  `` long thought ?
This is a phenomenon that affects all walks of life , including the business world .
And the Verwaltungselite is the status quo : 65 governors ( 85 Regionsvorsitzenden ) , Russia , the local lists of United Russia .
The new , from the West coming freedoms are often synonymous with chaos , as in the 1990s .
The public favors stability .
In this sense , the Russians are not of the extremist parties .
Tamara Tcherednitchenko of 54-jährigen , a  teacher , far superior to what ?
Those who are in power are not so bad , why `` replace them ?

What insurance is for me the best ?
The car insurance , which caused the driver potential disaster , which implies a high cost wiederrum , whose size depends on several factors , including by age , gender , date of the creation of a driving licence , family status , kind of insured cars and use , etc .
Owning a car is only the beginning .
Because it is even more difficult to find suitable motor insurance as the right Fahrzeugmodell .
First of all , a clear , what we are dealing with .
A take is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholders .
This agreement is going through a versicherungsvertrags in writing , which specifies that the society versicherungsprämie agreed and ABN obliged with a Abfindungssumme action disaster .
The versicherungsprämie is the price of insurance , which is made by several factors , including age , gender , date of the creation of a driving licence , family status , kind of insured vehicle or use .
The insurance companies , their prices , according to the statistics , so to a higher risk of higher contributions are payable .
For this reason , both about celebrating as well as women less contributions because , statistics show that these groups , thanks to their caution in a minor accident rate .
The same goes for married people , since these , according to the statistical values and therefore also convinced that companies tend to fewer accidents as single .
The benefits will be placed on the vehicle , the frequency of the dangers and the likelihood of an accident .
More common use , the more likely the damage .
In the preparation of the insurance Premium must a number of points .
For this reason , the drivers must carefully study the situation to select the take his personal needs most .
We lists at this point , the main items on which the selection of insurance would have to consider , not just a performance , but also a preisorientierte choice .
Under the 25-year meeting on the choice of low-cost insurance to many obstacles , such as the  rewarding driving experience and which young `` licence .
Even if it is an ideal insurance would be best , a Vollkaskoversicherung , there are cheaper alternatives .
The cautious drivers Vollkasko can choose to cover , so the Vollkaskoversicherung machines are covered , but at a low price .
This type of treaty means that the customer a fraction of the damage caused by the amount even pay .
For `` before the Treaty and on the basis of the versicherungsprämie levels . This is higher the smaller bezahlende amount to `` , said Luis Noguera , main exponents of Spain in first Vermittlungsunternehmen Europe , a Online-Versicherungen for .
Another option is the enlarged insurance , the customers against external damage , but not against the car damage incurred .
Furthermore , this type of insurance theft , fire , and Fahrzeugverlust .
A council .
If you are under 25 years old are , it is in your hands , to reduce the cost of insurance ; increases your credit advice , by versuchst to drive carefully and accidents .
A credit advice is a reduction in the basic with the insurance company .
On the contrary , includes a Strafzahlung to an increase in the tariff .
`` The amount of credits and total penalty depend on the society and its earnings .
If the company ertragsreiches a year behind us , can afford Bonus-Zahlungen , `` , to increase Noguera explained .
Once the 25-Jahre-Marke is exceeded , it is easier for drivers to conclude an agreement . Reason is the fact that with increasing rewarding driving experience the accident rate is falling .
So it is best to Vollkaskoversicherung for one with excesses .
`` Usually can do not benefit from their experience , both in the event of an accident and at the time of the `` , not as Vorsteher as the European company , and adds that the majority of accidents in the second Praxisjahr occur after the  , `` fear of the Anfängers was obtained .
Nevertheless , it is a married customers , not children possess a Vollkaskoversicherung wiser . But only , of course , if the financial situation of the person in question also allows .
From the insurers are couples with children as customers with the lowest accident rate , and correspondingly low their contributions come from .
In this case is Vollkaskoversicherung with a cover ( for a sum to 300 euros ) the best option . In the case that a high credit advice has been received , is an expanded insurance , the only the third Fahrzeugjahr .
`` They go as a whole should be more relaxed and have more purchasing power , allowing them to pay a larger `` , Luis Noguera .
For pensioners , it is Vollkaskoversicherung , one with excesses ( for a sum to 150 euros ) , or an expanded insurance , who got a sufficiently high credit advice .
Ultimately you have to Bear in mind that the take something very important , not only because they are the drivers against possible damage , but also because of high costs , require that a thorough selection , our personal situation .

Klimapropaganda
Since the klimadebatte both the skeptics of climate change , as well as those who are in the social and political debate in the foreground , a merciless criticism , the movement as a whole - a strong cohesion .
Especially if it is a leader of the movement which , as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero , the fight against climate change as more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even suggests , to design a  new contract with the planet `` .
This proposal will make him Erklärungsnot in on the action , Nicht-Handelns and his government , which has played a decisive role in that Spain within the EU at the top of the countries which meet the Kioto-Protokolls least fulfilled .
Who is responsible for noncompliance with the rules on which sectors is this and why his administration has the  contract with the planet `` had proposed , this development is not stopped .
Moreover , it has now been forced , the citizens of Spain , which he planned operations against climate change , without warning .
The companies will be affected by this kind of behaviour of the citizens should be changed , the individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and the economic consequences .
More specifically , those who are victims , and to save the planet will pay .
However , there and in the future there will be no such statements .
Precisely because it is Aufopfern and the pay for it .
Because the measures against climate change can be used in real terms , are unpopular .
They are kostenreich , troublesome and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens .
Even the Benzin-Cent proposed by the PSOE Zapatero wahlstrategisch seen seemed so dangerous that he felt obliged to withdraw the proposal again .
Accordingly , it is now the planet with nothing , with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences to save .
With impressive words , commissions and committees , protocols and new posts .
With its contracts with the world , the other campaigns as appropriate politician neither speeches , yet still demand , but Instead of challenging edition , the meeting and his pad and goodness no other .
But this can only happen if the treaty does not lose its purely virtual in nature and therefore also differs does not claim that the bicycle in the future single travel , or we just erfrischen with a range .

And that was the catalyst - now he wanted more .
Until you make a profit , let you
`` This is like a snowball , '' he said the policemen .
But the bosses knew allegedly of everything , or knew it .
`` As long as I earned money concluded . ''
But then came at the start of this year , the big blow .
On a single day , he lost a billion euros .
On a weekend in the middle of January , he wanted it .
On Monday , when he came to work , he was no longer an employee of the bank .
And a few days later , the bank announced that it is appropriate lost five billion euros .
And how they were introduced him ?
He made suspect by a holiday .
`` I have just four days last year .

The Mitschnitt seems a distinct revival from their big time `` live in 1974 . ''
Even then , they were much celebrated abroad .
The scheduled sensation occur then gesetzter in the shape of three Abendtafel in the House .
Each has its kästchen , its Cable and above all his buttons .
Dieter Moebius blütenweißen shirt in claim with 63 years ago in the middle .

Right from the audience , krümmt , Hans-Joachim Roedelius itself , 73 , konsole to .
Everyone has noises , sometimes even a Beat .
And sometimes it is inadvertently run over a piece of music .
That seems to be that gentlemen itself was not large .
The musiziert Harmonia band again , has , under Krautrock-Liebhabern for some excitement .
Although opinions may reveal : targeted enquiries revealed the name Popgedächtnis while schwirrte through collective , but not so strongly in this band for 32 years to painful .
But why should not the German his living legend from the 1970s to celebrate ?
Given what Krautrock is misleading in England and America has always been more than in our own country .
When the Musikwirtschaft the survivors of the Cologne group Echo-Preis can 2003 for life 's work , was referring to the house in Popgesichter Germany .
As the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the hymn of praise even during the band La Düsseldorf and newly ! Bedankten , knew the surprise no borders .
When Rother hockte Michael concerts later in the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage as an old mate .
The problem of ignorance at home and the naïve optimism on this point in the alien is one thing .
The memory is Harmonia overwhelmed with , because the triad existed only two years , and this time Wirkungsmacht far less than they subsequently unfolded from other .
Roedelius Moebius and with the artists had previously Conrad Schnitzler under the auspicious musiziert name clusters .
First , we played in a basement Schaubühne in Berlin .
Then in Düsseldorf , for economic reasons for the church Plattenlabel largely .

The first album was Harmonia `` music of '' and the forthcoming `` de Luxe. ``
So calm and modest music and sound , the band suffered material deprivation .
The Reisigsammeln was not only the selbstfindung .
Now `` live CD appeared in 1974 , '' was Griessem a chorus of mitgeschnitten , 50-köpfigen , Rekordkulisse a short , as anyone to recall believes .
By Rother , then Harmonia the desire to accelerate and occasionally .
For Roedelius Moebius and a making improper demand .
The band announced their separation in 1975 .
Rother Esoterisch-Sphärischen landed in and secured its existence by alben such as `` inflammatory heart . ''
Clusters in the 1980s has been revived and has more Harmonia than it ever was .
The Griessemer Grönemeyer Livealbum is there .
The Plattenfirma Greenland has set itself the goal of Krautrock , as authentic German contribution to the vibrant music .
New , was already doing Roedelius Solowerk dug as .

Does the chorus of the House .
Under the leadership of Morgensterns , Barbara Soundwolken , gewispert gehustet , and a fine point Aaaaaaaah with no emphasis `` ! `` .
Krautrock has always been a very English concept .
It was never about rock .
The roots were in the Blues looked less than Musikhochschulen ( CAN ) , Technologies ( plant ) or on the run from artistic and social conventions ( clusters ) .
Who here , `` ' 68 ! `` , was not entirely wrong , and Harmonia , including not now calm .

A risky departure , because of its duration , the bewohnbaren distance of modules , the speed with which he has been organised and the  astronauts who see gebastelten `` instruments to carry out repairs has made several records .
The problem met on Wednesday as the astronauts the module harmony of the Challenger Discovery had pushed , a huge zylinderförmiges part , which will soon be the European and Japanese science laboratories .
This module is a kind of Landungsbrücke Modul-Labore for the .
But it must be supplied with electricity .

The restructuring was stopped Kollektor , no more damage .
The astronauts originally scheduled for Kontrollgang to leave the challenger Discovery and then Sonnenkollektor another , whose rotating system was flawed should repair forcing damaged in the Kollektor .

For Teddybären a name , there was now a court in Khartoum .
After indication of her lawyer , the British teacher in Sudan for insulting to Islam , was charged on Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent deportation .
The British was accused of six- or seven-year pupils to , a Teddybären the name of Mahomet , although any portrayal of the Islamic prophet is banned .
They had it deserves , ausgepeitscht .
After parents of schoolchildren kultusministerium on several occasions complained in Sudan , 54-jährige Grundschullehrerin was in the Unity High School was operating in Khartoum Sunday at home and under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of the insult to Islam .
Indeed , this case began in September , when the teacher the six- or seven-year pupils on a name for the Klassenteddy to select .
 Children are eight names , including Hassan , Abdullah and Mohammed `` , Boules , Robert head teachers reported .
Finally , as the class to vote , choosing 20 of 23 children Mohammed as favourite first names .
Certainly , Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet , but above all a in Sudan very common first name .
The children have a book for the class , with the photograph of the bears , bildunterschrift and `` of Muhammad , my name is `` .
The Bear even bore no shield with this name , but the problem is simply that the portrayal of the Muslim prophet as an insult to Islam .
One of the Muslim member of Gillian Gibbons , at the same school in Sudan , said that he knew them well , and they would never have had done something , making it a religious faith to offend , `` my only regret is that children has asked for a name `` to vote , in his view , this is just a `` `` innocent mistakes .
An opinion which many school teacher , who `` this very sensitive to `` their pupils and a `` person who never in the class `` talk about religion .
It should be noted that the first name , Mohammed at the same time in Great Britain Zweitname two main thrust is , for which the English 14 different Schreibweisen exist .
This often from Muslim families selected forename is regarded as a kind of reverence for the prophet ( he is the eldest of a family there ) .

England faced with a decision on Owais by Bopara and Ravi Shah
Two dilemmas , each of them almost as difficult as the other .
Who is supposed to be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend , Owais Bopara Shah or Ravi ?
And , no less relevant in a broader context than the first Test against Sri Lanka , who should make the decision ?
The second question is important because , Graveney David , Wahlvorsitzende , to call at least at this particular title , is Cheftrainer , Peter Moore 's and captain Michael Vaughan and help to decide , and because the table of Morries high , the English managing director with applications to slowly for national Wählerämter fills , if not for what in part-time .
Whoever the sixth Schlägerposition not , will be unfortunate , but life is often unfair and sport , it is certainly .
It is never easy , just want a person , which allows for the top of its berufszweiges , and somebody else never hinauskommt the lowest rank , sometimes because of a lack of good fortune rather than ability .
It is not only in cricket , where the choice is difficult , where decisions are needed , which are at the end of subjective .
It is the right time for Bopara levels ?
Is it fair to Shah if it does ?
The same can perhaps in another area to be asked whether John Edwards or `` Tubby '' Banerjee , both intelligent young executives with good qualifications , the business familiar , should be promoted .
Who can say what the right class for a cricketers , unless he has the opportunity to be submerged or swim .
Of course , pay a great influence on decisions , but prospects of it .
Within a team needs a cricketers master 's eye at the right time , if he can take a Wicket and a bat , regular opportunities in order when he , as a one-day cricketers impression .
The eyes of the Auswähler to catch is more complicated .
There were many who last season better than , for example , when James Anderson , who appears to play in the first test , even if Harmison Stephen themselves as healthy and as the wind in the nets kegelt .
Anderson took Wickets 32 first-class with 33 Runs a position on this tour .
Chris Tremlett , only 29 with the same modest average , but both had its high points and hope for more .
Whether Bopara Shah or Asgiriya stage plays in , can only be a Ansichtsfrage .
The election could the careers of both men , or it might make little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first , with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs , however , it was Paul Collingwood at kämpfend to consolidate the breakthrough to a major Testkricketspieler expeditions and even though he was a double hundred against Australia in punktete Australia , perhaps still undervalued .
Probably that Graveney is , Vaughan and Moore 's , after a further discussion within Netzsitzung of Asgiriya today in stage its conservative instincts and bauchgefühl Shahs for greater experience of Boparas youthful enthusiasm will follow .
There are arguments for both .
For funkelnden Shah says his Test-Debüt-Innings and valuable 88 in Bombay , 43 first-class hundreds , and only six of the Bopara , with 22 years is seven years younger , and their angedrehtes record against bullets .
But Shah only 10 Runs in his two Innings in May against West Indies on the test in Lord , its Heimatarena as a player from Middlesex , and this , plus its immediate rejection of the Auswählern as Vaughan healthy was his position for the next game seems to reverse the momentum from his proposal , which was obviously in Mumbai .

The price of extended weekends , however , that we samstagen from the very well working or in school .
When the day before or after the holiday , ultimately will be dealt with , for long years of labour in a specific regulation .
The legislation applies to all employers and employees , for public employees and officials of public service .
Here are only exempted firms and institutions in which the company without interruption , which includes the holidays .
This year , the working order only by the festive season slightly confused : 24 December remains formally life here , since most of the days between Zeitausgleich Christmas and New Year 's Eve , or the special suspended vacations .
Next year more days ' holiday in the Wochenmitte , or at the end of the week , so that the Umdisponierungen working days will be less than this year .
The calendar will first around the Labor Day `` on its head , '' so that the people just four days in a row can stay at home .
Saturday , April 26 , will be a day for the Friday , 2 may be a day of rest .
The second umdisponierung is connected with the holiday on 23 October : on Saturday 18 October will Friday 24 October completion in advance .
At the end of the year , however , is completely under the sign of the holiday season , after starting on the 24th December and remains , even if New Year 's Eve falls on a Wednesday .

The labour pains
Gordon Brown has yet another hineinfallen discovered the hole ; its way out of this game will remain the same .
For British scandals , the schlüpfrig does not .
Seem a title held by any politician , sold Hotelrechnungen in Paris not having paid gelutscht cloves .
But the revelation that a rich businessman donations for Britain 's governing Labour Party on more than 650,000 pounds ( 1.3 million dollars ) over four years under the name disguised by other people , and that the party failed to live up to that , is something without which the disputed territory of Gordon Brown would be well managed .
As two months ago the prime minister of the demand for an election from dämliche had the intelligence of British insulting , by stating that opinion polls this decision had not influenced , there was hope that a robust and efficient government would offer .
Instead , as Vince Cable , the increasingly Vertretungsvorsitzende clever , the Liberal Democrats , said , once the most dreaded Brown by Stalin to Mr. Bean .
The heavy-handed rescue of Northern Rock , a wounded bank showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under siege .
Ill-conceived proposals to change the tax code , business groups against the government .
The steuerbehördliche loss of personal data of 25 million people showed incredible administrative pick .
A trio of retired generals launched an insurgency in the House of Lords in protest at cuts in spending : minister of the armed forces , they said , is a teilzeitjob .
Now there are the many donations of David Abrahams ; Peter Watt , Labour 's Secretary-General ( and your former Erfüllungsleiter ) is already resigned .
None of this means that Brown irrevocably direction departure .
Nevertheless , governments can a turning point , after which they find it impossible to govern .
Neither may still have confidence people politicians , but they usually keep their scepticism , if a new force takes office .
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister , the situation improves , and they need not even a long time is this postponement : public service begins leaking ; the cabinet ministers chatting start ; the press is looking for bad news , and the government is defensive and no ambition .
In a way that is the position of Brown is particularly difficult because , unlike other political leaders can not claim a new broom .
He likes to Tony Blair would deny he was his lieutenant .
The problems with Northern Rock and the Steuerzuständigkeitsunterlagen , for example , hang together with decisions that Brown as chancellor of the Finance Ministry .
And even if not directly was involved in Blair 's mishaps - as in the long `` money for title held by '' study of political parties , the voters may be working on the assumption that he was .
Nevertheless , Brown 's situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The errors are not quite as horrible as the conservative they describe .
Like Mr. Bean , nobody died or has beschwindelt altogether .
And the antidote , painful as they may be , is deliver what Brown 's naturally Stalinist tendencies are promised : a reliable , solid and easily brutal government .
The new song and dance about political donations is a good example .
The garboeske Abrahams , its donations , with its charitable gifts , he says , comparing wish no public recognition for his benevolence .
This may be the case , but the decision was not for him .
The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear , and they exist in a clear reason : the public has a right to know who is buying access to those who govern the country .
Watt , who says he should have known by Abrahams agreement , but not that it is illegal , of course , some questions , just as Mendlesohn Jon , Labour 's Hauptfinanzeintreiber , on the odd donations have been told in October .
But so far , Brown is not included : there is nothing that indicates that he knew of this confusion , although most of the payments after he took office in June .
To date , the prime minister half the job .
He has quickly the violation of the law by his party , but he watered-down this determination by seizing a well-known instrument , a committee of inquiry conducted on the subject , to complete the picture , a bishop in retirement and a judge .
In this case , the `` lessons learned '' not very complicated .
If the law has been broken , it is a matter for the police .
Apart from that there are other things which Mr. Brown must be done , as something of a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life , to find vacant for six months , and move forward with a drastic reform of political parties .
The dignity of the hard-liners of the labour demand with the conservative to collaborate and possibly the special financial relationship with the unions , bitter tablets for a party members such as Mr. Brown .
But he should have some partisan facts .
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls ; he has two years to voters ; and the only way he can achieve a victory , is unquestionable probity and solid competence .

Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he is not worthy of a presidential Schneemann , to be consulted .
Nevertheless , the Republican candidate for the presidency finally ready to take part in a debate on Youtube in the ordinary voters questions on video and submit them to the candidates .
None of the issues on Wednesday evening , 28 November , were raised so ridiculously as the Schneemann , the Democrats on global warming in the Youtube debate the other party .
But the questions and the answers reflected this time , the State of the Republican Party in the elections next year .
It is not known exactly how the producers of CNN , which mitunterstützten the debate , the would be zeigenden to Youtube Clips tell .
But in the first half hour of debate , the longest the one issue that has been devoted to immigration in the heart .
The issue is one of the most potent issues for Republicans .
The CNN asked a group of hybrid electorate a dials , if you heard things they liked , the company said leaders of the approval than the candidates strict control over the borders of languages .
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening between Rudy Giuliani was the national champion , and Romney , who is in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire has moved forward .
Giuliani shackles tried the reputation that he was soft on illegal immigration , when he was mayor of New York .
He was attacking Romney in the former governor of Massachusetts accused , illegal immigrants for work on his house to have stopped .
The two , particularly formidable apart as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates an `` amnesty '' ( the illegal regular status and the opportunity for citizenship would be ) support .
Lesser candidates , like Duncan Hunter kongressabgeordneter , a kalifornischer , and Tom Tancredo , a Colorado congressman , has been able to raise them on this issue .
None of the two men has serious chances for the nomination , but both remain in the race , perhaps because they used and harder than other Immigrationspauke being .
At least in the area of immigration parts the candidates basically the same views : tighter borders , intolerance towards illegal migrants .
This issue , combined with fears over toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world , help the Republicans the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives to forget or .
But the debate has been clearly problematic than other issues were raised .
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he has Waffenrestriktionen in the past supported .
JOHN MCCAIN and Romney debated whether simuliertes drowning as torture should be considered .
A questioner asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible .
This meant that Giuliani , arguing that although the Bible his favored book , the story of Jonah and the Europe may not be literally believe .
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
Mike Huckabee , now , contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent poll in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism , said that the death penalty is painful , but necessary .
When he was pressed whether Jesus they would be in favour of lachte , he said , and Jesus was too smart minding office .
The chase is exceptionally wide open .
Huckabees rise in Iowa coincides with Spendenerfolgen Ron Paul 's latest and his Beifallsstürmen in the debate by Wednesday .
These two are hochgeschossen from nothing , because the two wing of the party has yet to be one of the better-known and more traditional candidates .
In 1980 and 2000 , the party of a candidate from the outset and convincing together with winning a message about the grandeur of America and a Zwinkern on both Wings of the party .
This time , the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear .

`` I do n't trust the government , which supports the criminals , my house burned down , having way . ''
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis from Shiite residential areas and vice versa , leading to the creation of many places , where tensions have subsided .
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees sectarian tensions will stir up again and it conflicts .

At the time of the Spaniard was Cuba whose bastion for the conquest of America .
People called it the most beautiful place ever seen a human face .
Havana was once a Durchgangslager store or by estimate that the Spaniards in America had stolen and then transported to Europe .
And then came the American era .
The Hotel Nacional came at the end of the 20th century .
It also build one of the leaders of the American Mafia , Lucky Luciano , because everything in the United States was regarded as a crime ( especially during the Prohibition ) , Cuba , and supports , drugs , gambling , prostitution .
Among his guests were among

May Havana , particularly his eldest part , strong decrepit , nowhere to be found around so many wonderful colonial beautiful sights as it is here .
Other locations are being herausgeputzt , for example , Trinidad .
In view of the fact that tourism is essential means of money , there was for this development has given the green light .
In the last 15 years , not only in Havana new hotels , but also in Varadero , on the coast of Holguín province , inselchen and Cayo Coco as Cayo , Guillermo and others .
Cuba is still a fad in the world is unique and , above all , Eisenbahnliebhaber attracts .

It is this valley , where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown .
In his Endform , they can meet him when they Zigarrenfabriken a visit from Havana .
Some may find it interesting that the Chilean consequence of the `` Major Zeman '' spin .
Trinidad
An ancient city shortly after the Spaniard had invaded the island , was established .
Fame and wealth , the trafficking of slaves and sugar .
The wealth represented in the schmucken beauty of the small town .
The Spanish Kolonialarchitektur , deeply influenced by the subsequent French settlers , 400 years since hardly changed .
Trinidad , between the sea and the Escambray-Gebirge , is such a remote place that it still there in the 1950s , of the last century , there was no street by the region with the rest of the country .
This isolation helped it has gone unheeded .
Nothing has been built there , but that does not come down , and everyone was happy that he a roof over their heads .
If you for Trinidad more than one afternoon time , it is interesting places in the vicinity , such as the Ancón Playa Beach , or `` Valley of sugar factories . ''
In the evening , should you in Casa de la Música , in the darkness and where the music until tomorrow is not silent .

It is widely used to save
This year , more than a thousand infections in hospitals , which lead to the improper handling of antibiotics were due .
Sanitary conditions in hospitals , the overcrowding in the beds , congestion of personnel - all factors that the tide of infections are not necessarily favourable , such as the chief of the National Epidemiologiezentrums doctor .
It is widely used as well .
Traumatologie-abteilung of the János hospital MRSA-Infektion was recently diagnosed with it .
The antibiotic-resistant bakterium has found a male patients and , after a serious accident ended up in hospital .
The patient was isolated .
At the beginning of the year , there was already a similar infection .
The injured have been hospitalized because of a serious released from the hospital , not long after the man was MRSA-Infektion with a return was an important operation because of the Bakteriums since then , which is still in the patient 's body , not yet .
To 10 December of this year , 1094 from hospitals were generated by multi-drug resistant virus infections to the National Nosocomialis reported surveillance system , such as the chief of the National Epidemiologiezentrums Doctor Böröcz , Karolina .
So many people , generated by multi-drug resistant virus infections in hospitals with security , the real figure may be higher .
About two thirds of ( 683 infection cases of MRSA ) , Methicillin-Oxacillin , which triggered Staphylococcus aureus resistant .
Staphylococcus aureus that bakterium ( SA ) , about a third of the people in front of their noses , without there being a disease .
Sa-bedingte infections Halsentzündung ( such as mandelentzündung , inflammations , the skin and wounds ) tend to respond well to antibiotics , they are well curable .
The resources are , however , too large extent or incorrectly applied , are respondierenden from the good antibiotic-resistant bacteria in appropriate conditions in hospitals quickly spread .
Especially in patients with geschwächtem , or durable poorly functioning immune system , but also in older , or patients with low body weight can these bacteria severe infections , Wundinfektion or such as Blutvergiftung , Sepsis , cause .
The medical director of the János hospital show that the MRSA-Infektion nothing special such incidents are part of the Krankehausalltag .
We should not infected with the epidemic manhte Tibor confuse Nyulasi - MRSA , there is just not where they are not .
Resistant to antibiotics
`` Such patients are isolated , nursing staff Gummihandschuhe bears and masks supply , and we have the treatment for necessary antibiotics Tibor '' , Nyulasi .
When they arrived at the hospital patients on MRSA , an infection , there is not always to be avoided .
Sampling too rarely
The majority of MRSA caused by infections in hospitals would be preventable , but whether the current conditions and circumstances of bad for the control of the emergence or the spread of multiresistenten anthrax Karolina Böröcz says .
After this infection in hospitals and nursing homes , hospitals should take the eingelieferten MRSA-infizierte patients immediately investigated and isolated .
In the Hungarian hospitals will not , however , microbiological being so often practiced .
Not least because the state health insurance fund no subsidies for this survey .
Most of the cases that come to light only if the patient MRSA-Infektion a bemerkbare , so medical head of the Epidemiologiezentrums .
Part of the European Union , there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine , but there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes .
Antibiotika-therapien should be targeted , in other words , microbiological tests are necessary so that no resistance to the funds , but will this directive of hospitals are not always respected .
Among the ambulanten , or in the care of patients microbiological sampling were even more rare , Böröcz Karolina .
Saved used in the
Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA of a patient at the other most of the nurses .
That is precisely why händewaschen does , or wearing of gloves and masks a great importance , however , there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals .
Tröpfcheninfektion MRSA is transmitted or contact in the domestic hospitals , but not always the possibility to isolate infected patients .
The rooms are often overcrowded , the beds short ranked each , although you from epidemiological point a distance of at least 1.5 metres .
Karolina Böröcz as further points out , it is , unfortunately , in the financially less well-off hospitals even before that used in , there are few nurses , many patients - all factors that the emergence of infections positively .
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequently , or can the further spread of the anthrax stopped , where they are met , Böröcz Karolina .
Manifesto against MRSA
Mrsa-infektionen grip on the health caused enormous costs , so you will fight all .
In England , for example , the prevention of MRSA , or their control of the government program .
After the first signs of the programme is successful , as published data , is the trend of MRSA-Infektionen in England .
The European Centre for Disease Prevention ( ECDC ) has prevented the emergence of multiresistenten prion ( including MRSA ) , and the prevention of infections in hospitals , one of his key priorities .

Six chilling details about freedom to annoy
Email that abzuschicken , we forget Sprachnachrichten , which we never received harmless lies are not more notice : they offer `` colour '' in the everyday life in the workplace .
The question is , whether we used these small inconvenience , or it is better to the challenge and tried this cause misunderstandings vexing for others to vermweiden situations .
Tipps .
`` Sorry , I forgot you that somebody Marketing-Abteilung called the '' - says a colleague .
We missed a meeting ?
At best , it regrets and trying to make it , perhaps , during Marketing-Abteilung ringing and reumütig grants , it might have been forgotten , the news host ( that is , the less routine way ) .
Usually it 's an apology .
Before being involved in embarrassing excuses , we should consider how his colleagues truly uncomfortable moments may cause and try to avoid situations aware .
Something borrowed , which is not a itself ?
There is little Nervigeres , as if a document in Bürozubehör , or the phone , but it is not there .
Yesterday , the Heftgerät still on the desktop , today it is way too early ?
Or will the lost imagined pens around on the desk of a colleague who discovered ?
No one should ask any of my colleagues , because they are rightly angry when they see that something is out .
Kuverts so , no Post-its or from the office in the bag , because it might be a themselves : no longer here , if you ' s but badly needs .
Getratsche on the private lives of gentlemen ?
There is no effective means of Tratsch , one in the world has been set .
Anyone with whom , what ?
Where and why ?
The information ( or conjecture ) on the private lives of colleagues as possible , not at all tied to the nose !
And if someone is open and his intimacy secret suggests , we should not abuse this trust .
The best one is like a grave , rather than just not here , even if others on the problems of colleagues know .
Without reason ill informed ?
If you are in office , possessed by invoking nagging headache ill , because it just feels uneasy , or simply to rest , we should be clear about one thing : their own work , unextendable settlement , projects with fixed deadlines should the members Instead of a burn itself out .
The ball is not evil .
If you are on the eve knows that it is the next day , the office will create dazwischenkommen or something , so it could stay at home , you should have reported it in good time , so that neither the House nor the head unexpectedly with the absence .
Gesumme Gekicher , telephone ,
It is precisely in his work , but by Gekicher the members are upset ?
Mitgehört unwanted phone , you had better not hear ?
The members do not sing with sums are conversations ( over their heads ) , Getrampel leads , constant rant or grumble nerve .
All of this can be very disruptive , even if they are not a task ( letter ) is planning to organise deepened .
Is always the fault ?
Is a project is not completed on time , it has been an important letter or Nachrichte abzuschicken forgotten is important , it is the fault of their own people not be there .
After possibility should be limited to the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues excuses !
The best they his mistake and apology , if others were concerned .
The question of how to repair the mistake , or it can do so is all too apt .
In the office - a feeling at home ?
Schlapfen Trainingshose and : convenient for home , but the office has lost nothing !
Not even should then be Leger dress as if the job would allow !
Just not too messy - we should both his colleagues , as well as respect themselves that people in the kleidet office accordingly , if desired , beautiful and elegant .

We want to make all the right - or , as it will be interesting for others
Stop and go-Verkehr , a car in the middle of the allmorgendlichen jams .
From the radio erklingt a strange tune : the sound of a violin , coupled with electronic effects .
The vociferousness I Mr. higher .
The pace of change , in addition to the strains , the utterly and , as a true Klangjuwel a female choir .
It is the song Wings of Love `` Zagar '' mr2 , erklingt on .
The domestic musikszene has long been a luxury Electropop with qualitative .
But now , even the gridlock different if you consider the new Zagar album of listens .
The appearance of Yonderboi , some new and exciting production from the domestic Underground-Szene digital are slow to change the overall picture , and even if the Garagenrock with his Gitarrengequitsche in the Electropop indigenous shows : there are new under the sun .
Zságer Balázs in Pécs musizierte itself started Yonderboi in the band , before he - perhaps because a pub with no two Pfeifer sustain - His Own Path began .
The breakthrough came with his project Zagar ( to ) and his music , elements of jazz , electronic and pops conflates , but he managed only when one with a request that the Soundtrack to a film on him lasting was approached (
'Szezon Ferenc Török ' ) .
The formation , which initially appeared in smaller clubs , became the broader audience only known as the wan2 `` magazine '' its first album in 2002 under the alben top 50 domestic Zagar included and , together with Yonderboi , for almost one , even in the West kürte with trendsetter .
There is no doubt that Zagar were and his band `` trendy '' it interested but not , whether you like this brand .
The band has responded , but it should be : a new , better album .
It appeared , new album entitled `` can not Walk Instead fly ' could you open up new paths , however , the title expresses the desire to Pécser continuity with the years .
The expression from the time Zságer than Balázs with another band was away .
The luftige , flying allusion would indeed be in order , however , is not only the ethereal when nature of the music , the spirit and the trends are Gitarre appropriate - louder , the impact of rock and roll .
With these liedern has been living in England and with the band , `` the puzzle , '' Ligeti singer György working in the Millenáris premiere .
A song from the album has even Radioschlager managed to - the recently from early morning until late mr2 pop music origin Hörern Petőfi has no `` Wings of Love , '' with the participation of six of Sängerinnen domestic Divas ( `` Underground `` ) was added to Ohrwurm assault on the set .
All right ( ? ) .
The hvg.hu has Zságer Balázs demand .
Hvg.hu : this new bestseller raises the question : what is your music a certain class reservations ?
Zságer Balázs : the word `` Schichtmusik '' means not much .
In my opinion , there are two castes in the pop music , not mainstream and Underground , or alternatively and pops , but commercially and honest .
Even so-called alternative or Underground-Musik and can be rather meaningless as you can , but only for sale are produced , commercial music .
A good Pop-Nummer from an honest motive .
The Hörers the hospitality also functions on that principle of languages and borders independent .
Hvg.hu : you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience your music ?
Example : Zs abroad , especially west of US pop music has a greater tradition .
There are not only Twens teenagers or at concerts , but also the older audience .
You follow the trends in the pop music , around you happen much more closely because they did for part of contemporary culture .
Hvg.hu : what role the audience to in your work ?
It is important that those who , where and how many of your music ?
B . Zs . : of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more to our concerts .
But we have never komponiert on the market .
When the music is not in order to serve a purpose , but for some reason .
The role of the audience is generally in the concerts , where there is already a mutual interaction , but there are , in turn , only in the ungreifbaren changes in the moment .
Still , I am struck by one thing : you want to please everybody , but if you are not more interesting .
Hvg.hu : how far möchtest du the example of Yonderboi consequences ?
He is Solist and as his career more in the West .
B . Zs . : we are not really making its way this time to mention that we are constantly tried this in our music .
We are looking more like a Teamplayer on the musical presence of the other confidence and they develop themselves .
Of course , was originally compare our work with the Yonderboi will be inevitable , because many of us from his band come and take a different path .
Hvg.hu : mr2 Charts of Petőfi says `` Wings of Love '' in the first place .
Many have only in connection with this number is the name of Zagar .
Was the opening with a slightly populäreren style in the direction of a broader public deliberately orchestrated ?
B . Zs . : we had no plans to write a bestseller , as the spearhead of the album detract .
In this song is about more .
It was the final leg of the Albums , the Klangorgie and the rather more difficult issues to resolve .
Hvg.hu : how do you Sängerinnen the six selected ?
Why , what was the guiding principle ?
B . Zs . : the basic idea was to Gospel-artigen a chorus .
Then came the idea Solisten open as talented choir from the domestic musikszene .
The sechsköpfige chorus emerged - Kutzora Sena , Edina , Bori Judie Jay Péterfy , Enikő Hodosi , Neo [ LEFT-BRACKET for ] Németh Juci - which we can apäter 'Underground ' Divas .
Wolltest hvg.hu : the song as , or have shaped the girls ?
B . Zs . : no , there was a long-time in the Instrumentalversion , but as the material on the album was finished , we thought that this number still `` something needs . ''
The Akkordenabfolge , for Gesangsstimme .
I have the tune in eingesungen the same night , then you have the girls learned .
There was practically everything right and shocking spontaneously .
I can remember quite at that time , I was elektrisiert , but it was also the `` Divas '' were needed .
With my voice alone would not be the song never so strongly .
Hvg.hu : both on the record , the concert , but the impression that the girls would be in the background .
There is no Solo-Part ( apart from the brief solo by Judy Jay ) , they have no role sung entirely together and are no louder than the music , so their singing from music not only .

Venus is zwilling the Earth a hellish
Venus , despite their lebensfeindlichen is the Earth 's atmosphere than previously thought , the European spacecraft went `` Venus Express '' lightning in the atmosphere and Windwirbel in Poland , as winter on the earth .
For nearly three decades , scientists suspect that it blitzt on Venus .
Now , the European probe `` Venus Express '' proven - they sensed electromagnetic waves on the fringes of the atmosphere at : the lightning on Venus shooting at a rate of about 56 miles from cloud to cloud , Christopher Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles in the journal `` nature. ``
According to the famous `` Ursuppen-Theorie '' lightning life on Earth : storm give rise to reactions in the ocean have suggested the formation of amino acids , the building blocks of life .
Not so at Venus : `` If ever there was live there , it must have been very early history , '' said Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington .
Now it seems on the surface of Venus barely alive : the atmosphere , around one hundred times denser than on the ground , there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees .
`` Venus is perhaps the Teufelszwilling of the earth , but it is a zwilling , '' said Russell .
Why the Venus , the earth in mass and size similar , such an entirely different development has taken is Esa-Mission of the issue .
The launch of `` Venus Express '' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus-Forschung , since the beginning of the 1990s no probe more specifically to study the planet was away .
The latest research , now entering a number of `` -Artikeln '' nature will stress , according to the researchers are not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system .
`` They also show that the Nachbarplaneten of common ground with the earth are bigger than first thought , '' shares the ESA .
For example , the researchers in addition to the already well-known on North Pole whirlwind Wolkenstrudel on a Südpol , which is still significantly faster .

Although the Venus with sea-surface temperatures of 460 degrees and a pressure from 92 bar hardly reminiscent of the Earth , researchers claim that both planet under similar conditions .

Auchan most expensive , Tesco has increased by nearly one-fifth
The Budaörser Handelsgebiet Hypermarkets in this year , the average increase of 16 percent from last year , with the difference that there was this year no increase in the value-added tax .
Gazdaság Napi article from
The Budaörser Handelsdreieck did the price of a traditional Weihnachtskorbes Napi `` ' this year increased by 16 percent , but it Hypermärkten in all price increases over 1000 HUF recorded .
After prices in the lebensmittelmärkten last December davongaloppiert `` the prozentuell rise not drastic , compared with the already high , former initial level .
However , it is the consumers certainly deterrent that what he last year HUF far below 9,000 had paid this year 10,000 to HUF .
The price of Warenkorbs Napi `` ' the Magic 10.000-HUF-Grenze crossed HUF at least 91 in the subjects of the markets .
The highest 10.573 HUF price fraud .
( In 6800 , the 6.800 price in HUF )
Prices for Unicum and vibrant fish Vorjahresniveau remained practically , have grown sharply , however , are the prices of Putenbrustfilets and poppy , testament .
Prices of flour and bread with the data from the Central Statistics Office of Hungary , Auchan by 1kg , however , there has been Brotwecken for 139 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into .
There was the product of a competitive drop to below 200 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into .
Equally surprising was here , the price of a Pfandflasche two litres of Coca-Cola below 200 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into claimed , so the drink , including HUF only 257 deposits .
However , this year 's average Napi in `` Warenkorbs-Vergleich Auchan '' most expensive , and Cora at best .
Our calculations showed that Cora prices in the `` Napi '' to the Weihnachtspreisen basket last year to 15 , while Auchan Tesco and 18 percent respectively .
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive this year 's fraud 12 % , whereas the billigstem increase between basket in the past year and teuerstem this year , 21 % .
The average 1.480,00 HUF boom fraud .
The average price increase in the previous year was 1.206,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into still , however , the VAT hike imposes price last Christmas .
It is this process has taken the trade predicament : apparently such could not quite decide what preisspanne you in the individual articles should apply , because the consequences of raising prices on consumers incalculable .
( If the distributor umlaufgeschwindigkeit a product which is bad , it can make significant gains in the preisspanne , Verkehrsintensität that . )
Mehwertsteuer-bedingt , the Napi rise of the `` Warenkorbes '' last year so radical that the most expensive basket the value of 1720 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into 2006 crossed to draw , whereas the cheapest basket just 844 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into fraud .
This year , such extreme not seen as the most expensive 1.630,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into a basket for more expensive than last year , and even the cheapest , there was a 1.284,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into of price increases .
Compared with the last two Weihnachtssaisons became a disastrous effect of the increase , the price of homes in the Hypermärkten of them in less than 20 months to more than 30 percent .
( This , in turn , confirmed the data is not necessarily the Central Statistics Office of Hungary : some basic foodstuffs , the statistics office during the period of 12 months , a more than 30-prozentige high prices .
So in addition to flour with eggs . )
But if you look in the `` Napi '' market basket , this seems almost impossible for the latter , because the price level of expensive product last year , even in the worst case , little more than 10 percent rise .
Mehllieferanten are obviously in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - it was the drastic increase to the multinationals .
Happy Handelsdreieck complain are n't the Hypermarkets starting ; it is not by the good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warenhäusern no longer on prices .
It will especially large quantities , have bought paletten foods are Ladentische about it .
Wednesday morning , there were in all three warenhäusern epic in the Kassa queues , when suddenly the number of customers exploded .
However , the country Kundenfrequenz reported a drop , so many Meinungsforschern multinationals to complain that they could not even the planned turnover , not only with food , but also in sustainable consumer products .

Peugeot 207 test VTi SW 1.6 Voruteile are :
To tell the truth , I was never a big fan of the Peugeot 206 .
His Fahreigenschaften were not much value , the quality of today , the management and the processing , you could describe as somewhat below average .
But now his successor , the Peugeot 207 in the market , which is so much better .
The Kombi called SW is still a bit , and it only remains for me to change my mind .
When I Hatchback the classic the 207 had tested , I have had to , for example , through Kopffreiheit low Hintersitzen to complain .
These complaints , there is now no longer because of the Kombi if the is such that Zweimetermänner are not .
Soon further
The interior decorating , I am only briefly in order not to repeat .
It is a very successful design , where I try to just because of the Mitteltunnels reservations .
Here , a little more designerische building , where the car would be an so elegant impression .
The seat is convenient , and gone are the times where we may be about to brief seats and head restraints , complaining .
The Seitenhalt has 206 improved considerably .
With regard to the space is concerned , we can make the enlarged dimensions .
The Kombi is also the mentioned lack of Kopffreiheit .
Trunk in the boot
The main thing in this car , however , is thrown into ships ' holds .
The I need ( for aufklappbaren Rückfensters ) , beladbar than very good and platzsparend .
The hohlräume Haltegurten equipped with a perfect compromise .
You are not auseinanderziehen , and even heavier objects .
But do we know about the ladevolumen .
It is under the table in the basic structure of 428 litre , as compared to the competition a rather ordinary is worth .
But not in comparison with the Czech Republic top-selling vehicle this category of Fabia , the Škoda Combi .
If we have the 207 SW with the new generation of products from Mladá Boleslav , we note that the Peugeot clear signs of 52 litres .
For Auslandsurlaub or a Kinderwagens loading , this value is already critical .
The Positiva , however , I have yet to Umklappen the following the rücksitze of very shallow thrown into ships ' holds or even the very low Ladekante .
120 PS in four rows
Our Testwagen with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor was with cubic capacity 1.6 litre and a performance by 88 KW .
And , quite frankly , 1600-Kubik-Motor should be Familien-Hatchback , one .
He is quiet , has a low consumption and prefers leash .
When I saw him with his Škoda counterpart to compare the sometimes seems as though his auspuff with a rag blocked , then I can only be impressed .
The price list written speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly volkstümlich .
But we must remember that we are a well-funded car Innneren with a geräumigen and a very good engine have tested .
The basic price of cars with the 1400er putting amounting to 329900 kroner is still on .
With this engine is the cost of 410900 kroner from what is quite a lot .
The Testwagens proposes Premium of again with 80000 an extra Sweden kronors annually .
We had , however , Kopfairbags automatic air conditioning , Scheibenwischerauslösung , mechanical , electrical fensterheber and back and ...
So that costs a total 531900 cars less kronor .
That is a lot , but expect the increase they once a Fabia together and they are in a very similar sum .
Then the decision , which brand to be chosen .

The atmosphere of Venus could offer a glimpse of the future of the earth Show
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live , said scientists yesterday .
Data on a European raumschiffes orbit to demonstrate that a abgewandten the planet zwilling the Earth is still more than was previously understood .
Venus planetarische is the näheste neighbour of the earth .
The two worlds have roughly the same size and Planetenbahnen have similar , but Venus is a little closer to the sun .
Billions of years ago had Venus conditions that are very similar to those on Earth , and would have been even livable , scientists believe today .
But because of rampant Kohlendioxid-Treibhauseffektes , the erosion of the atmosphere with the sun and Rotationstempo slower Venus , gave a very different entwicklungskurs .
Today is the Planet of water and a heiss temperature , which is enough to melt lead by Hurrikan-starken winds and Blitzstürmen were devastated .
The findings of the spacecraft went Venus Express the European Space Agency , the planned for a year has investigated , provide a sobering look at how the planet in view of the catastrophic climate change could develop .
Professor Fred Taylor of the physics department at the University of Oxford , one of the head of the Venus Express mission , said : `` It is clear why the climate at Venus so different to the earth , while the planet , otherwise we are pretty much the same . ''
`` Our new data , it will be possible to construct a scenario in which the Venus billions of years ago as the Earth has begun , possibly with a bewohnbarer environment . ''

Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
`` The hunting party '' and `` murderous peace deal again two films with the Balkan war .
But both are not convincing .
Either the approaches to Geballer action , or they are too sentimental .
There is also Richard Gere in `` the hunting party '' does not help .
The good news first : while hiding the war criminals , Karadzic and Mladic are still in the mountains of the Balkans , but right there , in the Bosnien-Krieges gloom hinterland of now , the actor Richard Gere has been recovered .
We had the most beautiful man of the 1980 's least lose sight of it because too many nett-belanglose roles in Wohlfühlfilmen for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism a austrieben appetite for inspection .
Richard Gere is now suddenly was the main argument , `` the hunting party - if the gejagten hunters the ' ( why filmtitel today have always been so long , and Lokführer-Tarifverträge confusing as perhaps ? ) .
He contributes a wonderfully augenzwinkernde portrayal : basically is his Kriegsreporter Simon Hunt what from Gere could have been if the fate and the cinema would not help : a man , his best times long behind us , but the ruinengleiches statue of himself and his demise considerable vestiges of the former charm trends .
However , despite this Trumpfes , `` the hunting party '' together with the German production `` murderous peace `` , which also starts this week , the only Balkankriegs-Filme endless series of failed .
`` Murderous peace '' can be out : the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo Topol ( Adrian , Max Riemelt ) , which is a Serbin before Kosovar sniper salvage what a prompt still in love with them .
Good though it is that this is not the Serbs as the sole source of much misery , fernsehflache loses the film Geballer too quickly and action .
There is a kind of `` red for Cobra 11 '' without the motorway but with war .
This can be seen in `` the hunting party '' is a textbook case study , why there has never actually Balkan-Kriegsfilm a good .
The history of three US-Kriegsreportern , who Oberkriegsverbrecher the Serb `` the Fox , '' down with another director and another Drehbuchautor ( both institutional Richard Shepard ) at a different time , perhaps , a new `` Apocalypse Now `` .
Because the stories are so diverse : both times small teams go into the forest , something that is not what the military can and on both occasions , there will be a trip to the madness .
One of the reasons for the failure of `` the hunting party '' is that Simon Hunt not just the ramshackle cynics with heart than us at the beginning .
No , the Script must add to this a romantic affair with a later bosnierin andichten Muslim murdered .
Finally , `` the hunting party , '' the edge when the reporters within the last five minutes Zeitrafferverfahren succeed in what NATO , CIA and Kopfgeldjäger all around the world in five years have failed to catch : the war criminals and Muslim Bosnians to fair revenge .
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice at The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik telephone calls .
The film has a very human concerns .
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still rumlaufen , and he suspects the Americans and the French ( here will they be united once again ) the persecution because of undisclosed political agreements not too hard .
But the well-intentioned and evil are sometimes so similar , if a a famous Brecht-Gedicht in the sense .
It says Holzmaske on the Dämons an Asian at the arbeitstisch of the poet : `` Compassionate geschwollenen I can see the andeutend Stirnadern , : how tough it is to be evil . ''
Movies like `` the hunting party ' Schwellköpfe is exactly this type , but which indicate how tough it is , well .
The problem is not the Balkankriegsfilms genre of limited .
Recently , it was in this newspaper reports , Irak-Filme hollywoods that all major flops .
You can add : it has also never a good Südafrika-Film .
Almost always , when a star on the hot spots or herumtreibt minefields in the world , that is something the results as `` Rangoon '' with Patricia Arquette , `` Beyond Borders `` with Angelina Jolie or `` blood diamonds `` with Leonardo Dicaprio .
Perhaps all conflicts are still just in time to close .
After all , it had to pass before for decades to Hollywood with `` Schindlers list '' a good film about the Holocaust could swing .
Some films is probably mature , now known as the Vietnam-Werke Classic in force , `` the Deer Hunter , '' `` Apocalypse Now `` or `` Full Metal Jacket `` were so far from unanimous as masterpieces celebrated .
But perhaps we know today , where every slaughter in real time on two screens at home , is simply too much about the conflicts in the world .
And Drehbuchschreibern USA , the Bedenkenlosigkeit , which it needs in order to tell good stories .
`` Or otherwise , '' or `` the Great Dictator `` after all also are so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know how bad the Nazi regime , really .
Perhaps we should not be good if we want to make good films .
Perhaps it takes Künstlerblick a sarcastic distancing themselves from the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk .
As the parallels between its historical novel Lemprières Dictionary `` and the Balkan war was interviewed , he replied : '' That is , that some things never change .
Cities are increasingly terrifying dangers , people will always be brutally murdered in appalling and always war in Yugoslavia. ``

Climate propaganda
.
Above all , if it concerns a leader of the movement for the one as considers in the case of government President Zapatero , important than the combatting of the islamischen terrorism the fight against the climate change and even suggests `` signing '' a new contract with the planet .
This proposal however brings him into explanation need concerning acting or non-acting its government that contributed decisively to Spain being within the EU at the head of the countries which fulfilled the guidelines of the Kioto protocol at the least .
Who the persons responsible for the non-fulfillment of the guidelines are , to what sectors this is to be attributed why its government that contract with the planet had `` proposed did not stop this development . ''
In addition , he is now compelled , the Spanish citizens who planned to explain measures of him against the climate change without beating around the bush .
What companies from that will be affected what behavior of the citizens should be changed what individual and collective saving measures one must carry out and what economic sequences result from this .
I.e. , who has to be sacrificed and will pay for the rescue of the planet .
However , it has and there will be no such explanations in the future .
Straight line because it of the sacrificing and the payment is a matter .
For the measures which can be begun in real terms against the climate change are unpopular .
They are costs rich threateningly and for the accounts of the companies and citizens , unbequem .
The gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE even appeared seen Zapatero electoral strategically to such an extent dangerously that he saw him compelled to retract the proposal again .
It is now necessary accordingly therefore to save real consequences , with pure propaganda and empty sayings without each the planet with zero .
With impressive statements , Commissions , committees , protocols and new offices .
With his contracts with the planet the politician suited so otherwise for electoral campaigns must neither speak nor accuse still demand , instead however follow the exacting output to decorate this for hits and to impress others with its gentleness and quality .
This can however occur only when the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and , accordingly , does not claim that the bicycle becomes in the future the single fort movement means or we may refresh ourselves only with one of fields .

Auchan the most expensively increases by almost one fifth , Tesco
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trade area kept the average price increase of 16 % of the last year of this year as well , with the difference that there was no increase in the value-added tax .
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trade triangle , the price of the usual Christmas basket of the `` Napi '' increased of this year as well about 16 percent , however price increases were registered on all hypermarkets of via 1.000 HOOF .
After the prices are `` davongaloppiert '' on the food markets in the past December , price increase prozentuell did not turn out to be drastic , compared with the anyway high , earlier exit level .
However , it has an effect on the consumers certainly as a deterrent that that is not for which they had still paid in the last year far under 9.000 HOOF of this year available once for 10.000 HOOF .
The price of the `` Napi '' goods basket crossed the magische 10.000 hoof border about at least 91 HOOF on the investigated markets .
The highest price amounted to 10.573 HOOF .
( The price was next to 6.800 HOOF in 6800 . )
The prices for Unicum and lively fish almost remained on previous year level , heavily the prices for turkey breast nettings , nut and poppy by contrast increased .
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the central statistical office of Hungary , in the case of Auchan , there was however 1kg bread rolls for 139 Forint .
It gave up no competition limited price slump with the product under 200 Forint .
The price was surprising a two liter of Coke Cola pledge bottle here of under 200 Forint , therefore the drink cost inclusive pledge only 257 HOOF .
Nevertheless , Cora performed this year in the `` Napi '' Warenkorbs comparison Auchan the most expensively and the most suitably .
Our calculations showed that Cora the prices in the `` Napi '' goods basket in comparison with the Christmas prices in the past year about 15 while Tesco and Auchan in each case increased about 18 percent .
The difference between the most inexpensive goods basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the year of this year amounted to 12 % while the raise comprised between most inexpensive goods basket of the past year and most expensive of the current year 21 % .
The average price rise amounted to 1.480,00 HOOF .
The average price increase was still next to 1.206,00 Forint in the previous year , however the value-added tax raise made noticeable for itself with the prices for last Christmas .
Exact this procedure met the trade badly : Apparently the department stores were not able to decide so rightly what price chips they should use in the individual articles since the effects of the price increase were unabsehbar on the consumption behavior .
( If the vendor plans the circulation speed of a product badly , he can fall about essential profits in the price span which follows the traffic intensity . )
The price increase of the `` Napi '' goods basket turned out to be Mehwertsteuer caused so radically in the past year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 about 1720 Forint whereas the price difference was with the most inexpensive basket mere of 844 Forint .
Such extremes were not observed this year as the most expensive basket cost about 1.630,00 Forint more than in the previous year and even in the case of the cheapest one there was a price rise of 1.284,00 Forint .
A catastrophic price increase was manifested in the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons , the price of the daily consumer items on the hypermarkets increased for months less in 20 more than 30 percent .
( This again does not confirm the data of the central statistical office of Hungary unconditionally : The statistical office established one with some basic foods in the period of 12 months more than 30-prozentige price increase .
So for example next to flour also in the case of eggs . )
If one however throws a look into the `` Napi '' goods basket , this seems in the case of almost latter impossible since the price level of the product which cost already in the previous year at worst about scarcely more itself than 10 percent rose .
Flour suppliers are obviously in a more powerful position , than the egg suppliers - in any case they were able to shift the drastic price increase onto the Multis .
In the golden trade triangle , the hypermarkets do not complain ; it is reported continuously by good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not at all look at the prices more .
Large amounts are purchased from all , holdable foods go over the counters in pallets .
Wednesday vormittag there were endless queues in the case of the spot as suddenly the number of the customers exploded .
However , a smaller customer frequency is reported by the country so that many Multis are complained in the case of the opinion researchers that they could not reach even the planned turnover , that is not only in the case of foods but also in the case of nachhaltigen consumption materials .

Wants to prepare - or as one becomes uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic , the car in the middle of the all morning back-up .
A strange melody from radio erklingt : The sound of a violin , paired with electronic effects .
I turn volume high .
The pace changes , the bass comes to the previous sounds and as a real sound jewel a female chorus .
It is the song `` Wings of Love '' of Zagar , that on mr2 erklingt .
The indigenous music scene did not just spoil us long time with qualitative Electropop .
However now one sees even the back-up differently if one hears the new album of Zagar .
The appearance of Yonderboi , so some new and exciting production from the indigenous digital Underground scene contributes to changing the entire picture slowly and even if the garage skirt with its Gitarrengequitsche is `` in '' again who proves indigenous Electropop : There is what is new under the sun .
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs , made music even in the band Yonderboi before he - perhaps because a landlord house tolerates no two whistlers - follow begin its own path .
He created the breakthrough with its project ( Zagar ) and its music which fuses elements from jazz , Electronic and pop but had approached him first as one with the request to compose the Soundtrack to a film ( e.g .
`` Szezon '' of Ferenc Török ) .
The formation which had occurred originally in smaller clubs was known to the wider public first than magazine `` wan2 '' aligned for indigenous albums under the Top 50 its first album from year 2002 and Zagar , together with Yonderboi , to the almost single Trendsetter kürte marketable also in the west .
Were Zagar and its bands `` trendy '' for doubt son , it however interested no whether they as well like to bear this brand .
The band reacted as it : With a new but better album .
The new album appeared now with title `` Can not Walk Fly Instead '' could open new paths for them however the title already expresses the wish for continuity with the Pécser years .
The print-out namely comes from the time , was still as a Balázs Zságer with another band on the way .
The breezy , flying allusion would be yes in order as well , however corresponding - louder guitar , the influences of the Rock'nRoll strike the one - the time spirit and the trends in addition to the ethereal character of music .
With these songs , the singer György Ligeti working live in England and with the band `` The Puzzle '' imagined with the premiere in the Millenáris .
A song of the album managed it even to the radio hit - the mr2 Petofi transmitting since the whole day most recent pop music `` this has for the listeners with number '' Wings of Love '' , co-operating six indigenous singers ( `` Underground stars '' ) one received , successive ones set the ear worm . ''
Everything in order therefore ( ) .
The hvg.hu inquired of Balázs Zságer .
hvg.hu : This new hit raises the question : To what extent does your music of a certain layer remain reserved ?
Balázs Zságer : The concept `` layer music '' does not mean precisely a lot to me .
In my opinion , there are two boxes in pop music , that is not Mainstream and Underground or Alternativ and pop but rather commercial and honest .
Even so-called alternative or Underground music can be shallow and empty , just as they however also only for the sale can be produced which changes them into commercial music .
.
The listener 's receptiveness functions independently according to this principle , by languages and national boundaries as well .
hvg.hu : Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign public in comparison with your music ?
B . Zs . : Pop music has a greater tradition abroad , particularly to the west of us .
There not only teenagers or men in his twenties go to concert but also the older public .
They pursue the trends in pop music which happens round about them much more attentively because they consider them a part of the contemporary culture as well .
hvg.hu : What role becomes the public during work ?
Is it important , who , where , hear how much your music ?
B . Zs . : Naturally it is a good feelings to see that more and more come for our concerts .
We however never composed for the market .
In the case of us , music does not result in order to serve a purpose but rather for a certain reason .
The role of the public is usually marked with the concerts where there is already a reciprocal reciprocity but which there is again only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment .
Nevertheless , one struck me : If you want to make it of all right , you are no longer interesting .
hvg.hu : How widely would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi ?
He is as a soloist on the way and set up his career more in the west .
B . Zs . : We do not go its path really , times completely disregarded the fact that one attempts again and again , this into our music hineinzuinterpretieren .
We see rather than Teamplayer , the one in the musical presence of the other one trust and they unfolded .
Originally comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi unausweichlich were natural as several come to its band as far as we are concerned and took another route .
hvg.hu : Wings of Love `` in first place '' is in the Charts of mr2 Petofi .
Have heard many the name Zagar only this number .
Was the opening with a somewhat more popular style inszeniert in the direction of a wider public conscious ?
B . Zs . : We had no plans to write a hit which should then hold out as a train horse for the album .
In this song , it is a matter of more .
It was intended as a finale of the album with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult subjects .
hvg.hu : How did you select the six singers ?
Why was what just the guide principle ? her what was the guide principle ?
B . Zs . : The basic idea was to make a Gospel well-behaved chorus .
Then the idea came to combine the chorus from gifted soloists of the indigenous music scene .
Thus sechsköpfige chorus resulted - Sena , Edina Kutzora , Judie Jay , Bori Péterfy , Eniko `` Hodosi [ Neo ] , Juci Németh '' therefore `` - , we then baptized that apäter '' Underground stars .
hvg.hu : Did you just as want to have the song or do have it the girls mitgestaltet ?
B . Zs . : There has been the number for a long while in the instrumental version but however when the material was finished for the album , we imagined that this number still `` needs something '' .
The Akkordenabfolge positively asked for a song voice .
I still sang in the melody in the same night , they learned the girls later .
Everything came practically alarmingly spontaneously at once and .
I can remember that I was considerable elektrisiert then , but it has already needed the `` stars '' as well .
With my voice alone , the song would have never become so strong .
hvg.hu : One had both on the record and with the concert however girls would be the impression , the one in the background .
It gives no solo Part ( refrained from the short solo of Judy Jay ) , they have no own role , completely sing together and are not louder , than music , therefore their singing about music is not only accompanied .
They were on the arena as well rear .
Is it intention ?
B.Zs . : That they are stood at the rear was so because of purely technical problems .
However , we wanted to send no solo roles to them intentionally .
In the number , it is also a matter of this that one should forget its Ego a bit , forget who from where come and where on the way is , we allow simply that these certain wings , the wings of love emporheben us .
I would like that others as well feel this euphoric status that we felt when the song resulted .
hvg.hu : Which was the most expensive song ?
B . Zs . : During musical accomplish work real of none at all it , more more difficult tasks set rather with the mixture .
For example with `` Dorian Gray 's dilemma '' in which I play on a concert piano or in the case of `` Rock'nRoll 'Goes To The Girls '' where the Groove did not want to function longer , however gradually everything untied , as in the case of a Puzzle . '
hvg.hu : Which is your favorite number of the new album ?
B . Zs . : That changes continuously with the concerts and also where I have album `` losgelasssen '' now .
Currently there are `` prophet Is A Fool '' , `` Escape From The Earth '' and number `` Never The sperm '' .

Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Work secretary Mónika Lamperth is by no means zimperlich : Instead of a Christmas celebration , it organizes a work conference their staff members can have year 2007 died away with coffee and Pogatsche at which .
Some ministries celebrate with live music , others conjure in the civil servant hearts Christmas atmosphere with Tombola or activation .
Party , Christmas atmosphere , concerts and Buffet - thus the power celebrates .
The Christmas fever has already recorded the offices as well .
A ministry 's greatest Christmas celebration is held heuer in the defense department , however the ministry 's staff members are not in addition expected .
With `` the orphans ' Christmas celebration '' , children of fallen soldiers are given a present , with the `` mission celebration , '' family members are entertained for stationed soldiers currently abroad , there is however a reception for the press as well .
The department makes available around 25 mil . for the solemnities .
In comparison with other departments , the national agency for development ( NFÜ ) beats and the ministry for economy and traffic over the ropes .
The 4.32 mil . Forint expensive Christmas celebrations of the Ministry of Economics are restrained in the house of the future that approximately 350 of 600 staff members is expected .
The focus of the solemnities to be sure lies at Christmas , there will however be live Acts and a Tombola lottery as well .
The national agency for development ( NFÜ ) held its 4,7 mil . Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the house of the state justice Council ( OIT ) , with concerts and a banquet .
The hall rent amounted to 1 mil . Forint , the remainder was more than guests loaded 400 passed off for this .
According to our information , a department of the NFÜ is invited with another Christmas celebration as well , which of the Hungarian economic development center ( Zrt LIKES ) is organized from EU moneys .
For the celebration the building of the comedy theater ( `` Vígszínház '' ) was rent .
Confirmed this this information not has Zrt since the appropriate ones did not reach us .
To which the approach ?
The NFÜ was open the OIT building not only to the guests but also the ministry for justice and police essences which restrained the Lucia ball instead of a Christmas celebration on the 7 . December there .
For the use of the rooms , they had to pay no rent to the OIT .
Round 500 visitor came to the ball .

The ministries for health , work and home rule in each case prepare for Puritan celebration .
The Ministry of Health organizes for round 400.000 Forint the celebration for the staff members in its own four walls .
Work secretary Mónika Lamperth loads its staff members official garnicht for a Christmas celebration , but rather for the conference for the year end .

What insurance is suitable for me the best ?
The vehicle insurance which covers a possible claim caused by the driver includes among other things by age , sex , time of the generation of the driver 's license a high expenditure whose height wiederrum depends on various factors , family state , type of the car to be assured and its utilization , etc .
Only the beginning is to be possessed a car .
For the suitable vehicle insurance can be found even more difficult as the correct vehicle model .
It must be clear to one first of all with which which we have to do it here .
.
.
.
The insurance enterprises determine their prices statistics accordingly so that , in the event of a higher accident danger , even higher contribution payments become due .
For this reason fewer contribution payments must make both via 25-year-old and women , for occupy statistics that these groups have a smaller quota of accident thanks to their caution .
The same is also valid for married people as these incline after statement of the statistical values as alone being one and , accordingly , also after convicting the enterprises , fewer too accidents .
.
The more frequently the utilization , the more probable one the damage .
.
For this reason the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the autoinsurance which soonest caters to its personal needs .
.
These among 25 year-olds strike numerous obstacles with selecting a reasonably priced insurance , such as , e.g. , the small driving practice and the young `` driver 's license . ''
.
The cautious drivers can select a full hull with self-participation so that the performances of a full comprehensive insurance are to be sure covered but offered at a low price .
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay a part of the amount that resulted by the damage himself .
`` The amount is established before concluding the contract and based on the level of the insurance premium . '' `` This is higher the sum to be paid per small '' , Luis Noguera explains main representative of Spain in the case of peak Europe , a mediation enterprise for on-line insurances .
Another option is not however the expanded insurance which insures the customer against external accident damage against the damages that resulted at the own car .
In addition , this type of the insurance would cover theft , burning and vehicle loss .
Here a Council .
If you are old under 25 years , it lies to lower in your hand , the insurance costs ; your credit increases by attempting , go cautiously too and to avoid accidents .
A credit is a decrease in the basis tariff at the corresponding insurance society .
.
`` The height of credits and punishing payments depend on the society and its returns . ''
If the enterprise has a return rich year behind it , can permit itself to increase the bonus payments '' , Noguera explains . ''
As soon as the 25 year record has been surpassed , it is to be concluded a contract for the drivers more simply . The fact is reason for this that with increasing driving practice the quota of accident sinks .
Therefore it is the most sensible to decide on a full comprehensive insurance with self-participation .
.
Nevertheless , it is at a married customer site who possesses no children to conclude a full comprehensive insurance more advisably ; naturally only when it also allows the corresponding person 's financial situation .
On the part of the underwriters , married couples with children are considered the customers with the smallest quota of accident and their contribution payments also fall out accordingly low .
.
`` They travel altogether relaxed and '' Luis Noguera `` possesses '' determines , `` a greater purchasing power which permits them applying a higher contribution payment '' .
.
One must record last finally that the autoinsurance is something very important , not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage but also because it recovers high costs which require it that a thorough selection is made which of our personal situation corresponds .

Bungled operation supposes with case of death in New Jersey

Soon after that a police car was there .
And then , what is a further was there .
`` Then I saw approach the medical body inspector 's box car '' , said Livingston , a supervisor of the restaurant , on Wednesday .

England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas , each from that almost just as difficult as the other one .
Who should hit as a number 6 for England in Kandy on this week-end , Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara ?
And , who should the decision not make less relevantly in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka ?
The second question is important because David Graveney , the electoral chairman are , upon call at least under this special title , here Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan to help to decide about the leader trainer and because the table of High Morries , the English business-running director fills gradually , with applications for national voter offices , if even for which one in part time .
The one who does not even always get the sixth bat position will be unhappy but the life often is unjust and it is the sport doubtless .
It is never simple to nail exactly , make possible reach which the point of its job branch all person , while someone else over the lowest rank hinauskommt , sometimes due to lack of luck instead of capability .
Where judgements it are are not only necessary in the Kricket where the selection is difficult which is always in the end subjectively .
Is it to be risen the correct time for Bopara ?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it ?
The same can be asked perhaps also in a further area whether for example John Edwards or `` Tubby '' Banerjee , both intelligent young managers with good conclusions which know the business well should be promoted .
Who can say what is the correct class for a Kricketspieler unless , him is provided with the possibility to swim or to go down .
Obviously numbers have a great influence on decisions , but chances also have this .
Within a team , a Kricketspieler must catch the eye of the captain at the correct time if he can take a Wicket and a bat must obtain regular chances on the order if he wants to make as a one-day Kricketspieler impression .
To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complicated .
There was many this better in the last season than , for example , were as a James Anderson who will apparently play in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares itself healthy and as the wind bowls in the networks .
Anderson took away 32 prime Wickets per 33 Runs in order to earn a position in this revolution .
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average , but both had its glitter points and hopes for even more .
Whether Shah or Bopara play in the Asgiriya stage can be only a view question .
The choice could decide both men 's careers or it perhaps however makes little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka , Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first Runs useful with five Wickets and 40 , Paul Collingwood was however to be strengthened , then still fight for who created the breakthrough to a significant Testkricketspieler and this although he dotted hundred against one double Australias in Australia , still is perhaps underestimated .
It is probable that Graveney , Vaughan will follow their conservative instincts and stomach feelings for Shahs greater experience youthful enthusiasm , after a further discussion in the course of today 's network meeting in the Asgiriya stage via Boparas and of moorland .
There are arguments for .
.
However Shah made only ten Runs in its two Innings in the May toward west Indies in the test in Lord , its homeland arena as a player from Middlesex this plus its instantaneous rejection of the Auswählern as Vaughan healthfully was in order to cancel its position for the next play , appears to have taken the swing from its hitting , this still in Bombay obvious was .
The all expert from Essex shovel wise life pleasure by contrast has .
.
He suffered smaller injuries and supposedly a shock , but the first thing , which he did was to be taken out its Vodafone ( natural also gesponsort ) and called its team colleague Alastair Cook who had observed this from the distance and to say with enthusiasm : `` You saw that '' .
Bopara is a much better field player , he bowls here on the play fields , which appears to go with him his medium pace with some effect and hits with confidence and destiny .
To choose the correct man is a thing another to choose the correct time .
That is perhaps real art of the selection .
I in addition incline to provide Bopara its chance now , which does not mean that Shah will not perhaps however stand there well if , as the tea sentence from Ceylon suggests he is that who will play this week-end here .

Does a final year Rally lie ahead for the stock market ? Uneinigkeit in the case of the experts as a result of the US mortgage crisis

It is not Nichtsdestotrotz advisable to prepare prognoses at short notice and only on the basis of statistics . Above all , at the time when tensions to be taken seriously do not determine the current market occurrence

The Analyst trusts in this that these turn out to be positive .
With the selection of the values which should accelerate the Ibex to new maximum measures , the Analysten are united .

The choice of status Quo
On Sunday , it will not become excite in the case of the Auszählung of the urns : United Russia will decide the mass of the Russians on President Putins party , .
After a very barred election campaign , it confirms to her for coal faces following stability , yes even to Autoritarismus .
Three days before the parliament choices , the Russian President Wladimir Putin directs a report radiated on the public transmitters to the voters which although has already been recorded , the contents of which are however kept secret .
.
Yesterday the President nichts looked through when he received the foreign ambassadors and settled for delivering a new attack point against the west controls which of the interference accuses favorite subject becoming its during the election campaign .
It knows the price of a genuine democracy and expects us honest choices extremely transparently , and open , choices without cheatings '' , he added . ''
From the point of view of the opposition , they there wasted .
.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been  such dirty choices , not once in the time of Eltsin .
After suppressing the demonstrations on the last week-end , is had valid been convicted of illicit demonstration for ex-chess world masters Garry Kasparovder for five-days custody , according to visit ban for its attorney furthermore .
The Russians kept the mentality of the homo Sovieticus for themselves
After these parliament choices without tension , two a lot continuing questions raise :
 Who will begin Putins succession as a President ?
The office newspaper announced the date of the first electoral procedure of the presidency choices yesterday , the 2 . March 2008 ; the candidates have time until 23 . December to announce themselves .
Since he was chosen 2000 and 2004 re-electd , Wladimir Putin can not begin for a third mandate in sequence .
And now , no successor is found .
What role will play Putin after March ?
Prime Ministers ?
Chairmen 's of the parliament majority and the omnipotent party united Russia which will select government and President ?
What will always as well be it , will rejoice with the parliament or in the case of the presidency choices , the previous power .
That is tradition .
The Russians kept the mentality of the homo Sovieticus for themselves that they are not master of their fate `` the sociologist Lev Goudkov thinks director of the independent center Levada . ''
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the state university Sankt Petersburg even still goes back further : The middleclass society only developed further itself very slowly in this country which became five centuries to Europe christianisiert ; the famous community spirit delayed the development of individuality .
After the liberal reforms of the 90er years , Putin connected to the model of a paternalistic state again , which was completely accepted by the population , the more as no terror followed this new Paternalismus but rather a certain economic prosperity , Maria Lipman means of the Carnegie foundation .
Present  `` Russians  '' dispense `` voluntarily with the personal responsibility '' that they put intermittently on the day after disintegrating the UdSSR .
To which still consider for a long time ?
This phenomenon affects all society layers , including the business world .
And the administrative elite understands it to hold status Quo : 65 Governors ( of 85 Russian region chairmen ) lead the local electoral lists of the united Russia .
The new from which vests often are synonymous for coming liberties with chaos , as in the 90er years .
The public prefers stability .
In this sense , the Russians will not be correct for extremistischen parties .
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko , a 54-year-old professor : To which still consider for a long time ?
Those who are in power are not so bad why they replace ?

Polívka came about its kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight about brand `` kingdom Walachei '' .
He to be sure used as formerer designation `` Walachischer king '' for the judge in the region court in according to Ostrava , but a team had set up the project in long-term work about Tomás Harabis in co-operation with the actor .
Polívka did not participate in the negotiation today .
According to its attorney , the thing is not thus however probably concluded and its client will probably place vocation .
`` The argument concerns this that Mr. Harabis and his team want to participate in popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitär , '' attorney said following negotiation Polívkas .
Everyone imagined this actor and comedian just in the case of words `` Walachisches kingdom '' .
Harabis is also of the same opinion .
.
`` He said '' money obtaining and concepts of the activities .
The occasion is fight about money for him , as a result of .
`` After years struck them that the project is successful and that they could have something as well from that . ''
They want to gain parasitär in our work , `` he said further . ''
Lucrative business
According to the court used Polívka designation `` Walachischer king '' for the first time in one of its television broadcasts .
the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned 1993 him .
That was not however connected with the intention then to justify a fictitious kingdom .
Harabis came some years later to the thought to output walachische passports .
.
1997 agreed Polívka of the use of its name and its signature in the passports and offered its owners even reductions when visiting its farm and its theater presentation .
Who will sit on the throne ?
The judge also led today that Harabis used only the bare idea which made Polívka public in the broadcast `` arena '' for its managerial intentions .
`` Popularity Polívkas helped the project of the walachischen kingdom surely , '' said the judge .
It however added that the soul of project Harabis and its team are who would have devoted themselves to him intensively .
.
Since however began to accumulate the disputes between Polívka and Harabis , which culminated in the removal `` King Boleslavs I. chosen up to the Sankt Nimmerleins day '' .
The guide role then took as a queen mother in right upon cause Harabiss Jarmila Suláková .
2002 then handed in Polívka the complaint against Harabis and its company that the court rejected today .
The competition prepared by Harabis could bring clarity in the argument about the throne and a half princess .
A new king should come from this .
He did not yet want to betray details and deadline .
`` We want to rush nothing . ''
Something like that should be as the king move in the Walachei .
The king should be chosen for a certain time .
Even Mr. Polívka can make an appointment quietly , `` added Harabis . ''

Everything still openly
Mitt Romey said that he does not keep it worthy of a presidential candidate to be asked by a snow man .
In spite of this , the republican candidate declared himself the presidency in the end readily to stand for a debate on YouTube in which normal voters receive and hand in questions on Video in order to send the candidate them .
None of the questions , this on the Wednesday evening , the 28 . November , was raised , was as ridiculous as the snow man , questioned the democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party .
However the questions and the answers reflected this time the status of the republican party exactly which breaks up in the choices in the next year .
It is not known just so the producers of CNN that the debate mitunterstützten which selected the beginning candidate of YouTube clip to be shown .
.
The subject is one of the blow strongest subjects for republicans .
The CNN asked to manipulate a group of unentschiedenen voters a choosing disk if they heard things that they liked : The television institution noticed spoke points of the agreement severely as the candidates via the borders .
The sharpest and exchange longest of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani , the national outrider and Romney which pushed in the decisive inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire to the front .
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call , he was flexible with respect to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York .
He attacked Romney in that he the former governor of Massachusetts charged with having set illegal immigrants for working on its house .
.
It was successful more insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter , Californian congress representative and Tom Tancredo , a congress representative from Colorado , in the case of this subject nachzuhaken .
Neither of the two men have serious chances with the nomination , but perhaps both remain in the racing , because they earlier and harder than others struck on the immigration bass drum .
At least in the area of the immigration , the candidates divide the same views by and large : sharper borders , intolerance in comparison with illegal Migranten .
Help to forget or to minimize this subject , together with fears via poisonous toy from China or other worries over the remainder of the world , for the republicans the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives .
However the debate was became brought problematically as other subjects obviously for the language .
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported weapon restrictions in the past .
John McCain and Romney discussed this whether simulated drowning should be regarded as a torture .
One of the question regulators asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible .
This led to the result that Giuliani represented the point of view that although the Bible is its preferred book , he does not perhaps believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale .
A further question regulator asked whether Jesus would support the capital punishment .
.
When he was pushed for this whether Jesus would support it , he laughed about this and was said Jesus too intelligently for himself to apply a political office .
The racing remains open extraordinarily .
Huckabees rise in Iowa fells for most recent contribution successes and its approval storms together with Ron Paul in the debate of Wednesday .
These two are high shot from the zero because the two wings of the party were to date not yet able to agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates .
In year 1980 and 2000 , a candidate united the party with conviction with a victorious message over the size of America and a blinking from the beginning and to both wings of the party .
The party is split this time and the result is not at all clear .

For that , that she gave a Teddybären a name , it was presented for a court in Khartoum today .
After indicating their attorney , the British teacher who had been accused of insult of the Islam in Sudan on Thursday evening , custody and subsequent expulsion were sentenced to 15 days by a court in Khartoum .
The Briton was charged with having allowed six-year-old to seven-year students to give a Teddybären the name Mahomet although every representation of the islamischen prophet is prohibited .
It would have earned it to be whipped .
After parents of students had registered a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education and the Arts repeatedly , this was taken up on Sunday with himself home 54-year-old basic schoolteacher who was active at the Unity High School from Khartoum and accused according to article 125 of the Sudanese punishing law book of the insult of the Islam .

The children suggest eight names , Hassan , Abdullah and Mohammed under this '' , reports headmaster Robert Boules . ''
Finally , coordinates as the class , choose 20 from 23 children Mohammed as nicest first names .
Probably , Mohammed is the islamischen prophet 's name , but above all also a first name very frequent in Sudan .
Next , the children prepared a book for the class , with the photo of the bear after that and the picture signature `` my name is Mohammed '' .

One considers that first name Mohammed simultaneous also which in Great Britain at the zweit most frequent given second name is for which various styles exist in the English 14 .
This first name selected often by moslemischen families is considered a type of respect in the prophets ( he is frequently given a family the one first given birth to ) .
However how do the rules sound in the reference to the use of this first name ?
May one give a toy him for example ?

Venus is höllische twin of earth
The Venus is more similar than to date thought in spite of its life hostile atmosphere of earth : The European space probe `` Venus Express '' discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind eddies on the poles how they appear in the winter on the earth as well .
Scientists have supposed for almost three decades that it flashes on the Venus .
Now the European probe `` Venus Express '' produced the proof - it tracked down electromagnetic waves on the brink of the atmosphere : The lightnings on the Venus shoot 56 for kilometers of cloud in a height of round to cloud , report Christopher Russel about the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine `` Nature '' .
According to the famous `` Ursuppen theory , '' lightnings had the life resulted on the earth : Thunderstorms must have encouraged in the ocean reactions which led to the development of Aminosäuren , the modules of the life .
Not so on the Venus : `` If there were ever lives there , it must have been in the very early story '' , explains Sean Solomon by the Carnegie institution in Washington .
Today it on the surface of the Venus scarcely might give something lively : The atmosphere is one around hundred times denser than on the earth , there reign temperatures of 500 degree now and then .
`` The Venus is perhaps the devil twin of earth , but it is a twin '' , Russel said .
.
The start of `` Venus Express '' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research as , since the beginning of the neunziger years , no more probe has specially been for investigating this planet on the way .
The most recent research results which are now presented in several `` Nature articles '' not only emphasize the single good behavior of the Venus within the sun system according to the researchers .
`` They also show that the common grounds of our neighbor planet with the earth are first larger assumed '' , the Esa communicates .
Thus the researchers found a cloud swirl as well next to the eddy wind well-known already at the North Pole at the South Pole which still turns fundamentally more quickly .
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere , circumscribes a researcher team Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica .
The second innermost planet of the sun system has almost the same mass such as the earth and is almost just as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers .
The planet described as morning or evening star also revolves 225 for days around the sun in scarce .
But he concerns a lot slowly himself : A Venustag lasts 243 earth days .
Although the Venus reminds with surface temperatures of 460 degree of Celsiuses and a pressure of 92 bar scarcely on the earth , scientists assume that both planets developed under completely similar requirements .
In both , water collected which remained on the earth in oceans , on whose Venus was however lost into the area .
And while coal dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbonate rocks , it turns off the major part of the atmosphere on the Venus .

Richard Gere is not cynical enough simply
Again two films with the Balkans war occupy themselves with `` The Hunting party '' and `` murrderous peace '' .
However do not both convince .
Either the concepts set to Action too much and Geballer or else they are too stirring blessed .
There even Richard Gere can not help in `` The Hunting party '' .
The good report at first : To be sure the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans , however calculated there , in the gloomy rear country of the Bosnia war , the actor Richard Gere was now found again .
We had lost the nicest man of the eighty years finally from the eyes because all too many kind unimportant roles drove from one in well feeling films for women and all too many press conferences on the subject Buddhism as if desire for looking at .
Now Richard Gere is sudden the most important argument , `` The Hunting party - Wenn the hunter '' perhaps however `` becomes '' to look at ( film titles must be Warum really always so long today and wirr as locomotive leader tariff contracts ) `` to the hunted '' .
.
However in spite of this Trumpfes , `` The Hunting party '' continues only the endless series of failed Balkans war films together with the German production of `` murrderous peaces '' which start in this week as well .
With `` murrderous peace , '' one can make short process : The film deals with two German soldiers in the Kosovo ( Adrian Topol , max . Riemelt ) which saves a Serbian from kosovarischen snipers , would which this also still falls in love one with them promptly .
.
It however for that remains a type of `` alarm for Cobra 11 '' without highway with war .
On the other hand , can be investigated exemplarily at `` The Hunting party '' absolutely why there was never yet a correctly good Balkans war film really .
The story of three US war reporters who set out in order to track down the Serbian upper war criminal `` the fox '' could perhaps have become a new `` Apocalypse Now '' another time with another director and another Drehbuchautor ( both in personnel union Richard Shepard ) .
For the Storys are alike yes frappierend : Small teams go both times into the forest in order to accomplish something , which the soldiers and for both times it becomes a journey into the insanity .
One of the reasons for the failure of `` The Hunting party '' is that one is not Simon Hunt not simply the descended cynic with heart , he we are presented as this at the beginning .
No , the Script must attribute obendrein to him another romantic affair with a muslimischen Bosnian murdered later .
Finally `` The Hunting party '' goes the brook runter at the time when is successful for the reporters within the last five minutes in the Zeitrafferverfahren that , which Nato , CIA and all head money hunter of the world did not manage in five years : Catch the war criminal and leave the muslimischen Bosnians him for the just revenge .
That is so bad that one would like to call the international court of justice in the Haag because of crimes against movie theater logic .
The film has a deeply human request .
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still rum run freely and he suspects the Americans and not to operate the Frenchmen ( they should times be united here as an exception ) the pursuit all too intensively as a result of secret political agreements .
However the well meant and the bad one are sometimes so similar to himself that a famous Brecht poem comes for one into the sense .
.
Films such as `` The Hunting party '' have exactly such swelling heads which however indicate how exerting it is to be good .
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkans war film .
Become is reports recently in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywoods large Flops .
One can add : There was never yet as well a good South Africa film .
Is almost always valid : If a cataract is hung around on the crisis ranges or mine fields of the world , then something like that as goes `` Rangoon '' this out with Patricia Arquette , `` beyond of all borders '' with Angelina Jolie or `` blood diamonds '' with Leonardo DiCaprio .
Possibly , all the conflicts are still too specific simply within a given time .
Decades in any case had to pass it before Hollywood with `` Schindlers list '' was able to shoot a good film via the Holocaust .
Some film will probably still ripen - the Vietnam plants `` The Deer Hunter '' , `` Apocalypse Now '' or `` Full Metal suit coat '' considered a classic author now were celebrated seinerzeit of yes by no means einhellig as masterpieces .
However perhaps we know today where every mass murder in real-time comes two screens to immediately home , also simple too much over the conflicts of the world .
And that robs the Drehbuchschreibern the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs it in order to tell good stories .
`` Are or nothingness '' or `` the large dictator '' finally therefore as well became yes so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime reigned really .
Perhaps , one may not be if one wants to make good films .
Perhaps , one must have the sarkastisch disassociated artist look of the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk .
When this was asked for `` dictionary '' and the Balkans war to parallels between its historical novel `` Lemprières '' , he answered : `` That is only because some things never change . ''
Cities will always be awfully dangerous , people will always be murdered in ghastly way and war in Yugoslavia herrschen . '' always becomes

Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida

He returns in order to fight .

NHS `` foreign employee must check ''
The Scottish state health service must improve of outside Europe the check of the previous conviction registers for employees , said a member of the Kontrollorgans . outside
The recommendation of the main finance inspector Robert Black came after a foreign Doctor in Scotland was taken into Zusammmenhang with the attack on the airfield by Glasgow in June .
Black also about that pronounced doubts that the Scottish state health service has no exact presentations with respect to the number of its ausländischischen staff members .
However its report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly with a spot check by five health authorities .
The main finance inspector investigated personnel which were recruited outside the countries of the European economic area , as a result of the attack on the airfield from Glasgow .
.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in October in the Old Bailey in a video transmission and load with the supposed autobomb stroke within Great Britain in context .
It is expected that the state health service carries out controls in the preliminary stages of the employment of foreign staff members in order to guarantee that these possess the required qualifications , experiences and Autorisierungen in order to work in the United Kingdom .
Although the health government agencies Disclosure Scotland for inspecting previous conviction registers use , the agency does not not decree to receive this information via the competence outside Great Britain .
The main examiner 's report means now , in addition to other recommendations that the executive board should take up guidelines of the punishing register extract which helps employers with controls in various countries .
`` Although we found personnel documents in some references to these controls , these were not carried out routinely . '' the report determined .
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines before the employment with high measure but added : `` Our report demonstrates areas in which the system can be improved in order to guarantee that exact information concerning the number of the foreign health service staff members is available . ''
It is said BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry `` extremely improbable '' that persons would identify investigations in the preliminary stages of the employment of potential NHS staff members , could commit the future terroristische strokes .
`` It is been statement in the report that momentary Voranstellungstests functions the NHS Scotland well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver '' , he said .
The Scottish health authorities say that they have 1.161 foreign staff members momentarily , the predominant majority of it doctors and nurses .
Warnte the finance inspector however that the number is probably higher also therefore , because the executive boards would have problems to identify those staff members who are discharged for a fixed indefinite time .
The investigation determined furthermore that observe established control procedure mainly from NHS authorities into Ayrshire , Arran , Grampian , Greater Glasgow and Clyde , Lanarkshire , and Lothian .
Pass , work permission and qualification controls are a part of this .
the Scottish government checks currently before the employment beginning for foreign personnel in the NHS its policy and guidelines for controls .
The secretary for health Nicola Sturgeon said : `` A request was to be constructed this work for me in the light of the terror stroke on the airfield of Glasgow . ''
It supplemented that the Scottish government , in connection with the health authorities which would take into consideration recommendations of the report and guarantee that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines concerning the control investigations in the preliminary stages of the employment of all staff members - under this that from the foreign country as well - its publication is planned next month .

Ticket sharks
Does America 's Kreditkartenmarkt credit crisis infect ?
If blood is in the water , it is is only natural that back fins spin around excited .
Now where of America real estate market kränkelt , the predators have the Kreditkartenmarkt of the country in the sights .
Count Analysten of Goldman Sachs on the Kreditkartenverluste 99 billion dollars being able to attain if the infection danger of lower financed credits spreads to other forms of Verbrauchenkrediten .
Signs of the exertion are clearly visibly .
There are rises both in the case of the Ausbuchungen and in which case installment of dilatoriness which measure the share of the credits which are not in each case drawable or more than 30 days too late .
The HSBC announced in the last month that it took a 1,4 billion dollars partially , because of the weakness of Kreditkartennehmern charge collection from their American consumer financings .
It is nevertheless too early to lapse into panic .
Losses and dilatorinesses still are low .
According to the Ratingagentur Moody , the third quarter Säumnissrate was almost a full percentage point of 3.89 % below the historical average .
The worsening in the case of that installment can be explained in part by technical factors .
.
The industry also reports about sturdy payment installment which shows as the consumers pay off a lot every month of their debts
and the trust in kreditkartenbasierte value papers is quite great , in spite of the immobilization in other corners of the structured financing .
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup , a research enterprise , counts on the output volumes for 2007 being 25 % higher in the end than last year .
There are probably direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the Kreditkartenmarkt : it is more probable that consumers Kreditkartenschulden receive , now that egg gene home credits dry up .
The ticket exhibitors however look at the money river instead of on capital values therefore falling house prices not necessarily do not initiate a change in the Kreditwürdigkeit of the Kreditnehmers .
They can be of advantage even for the ticket exhibitors .
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay the mortgage installment , sink if the real estates are less value than the value of the loan ; as a result the ticket debts become more important under the refund priorities .
Ticket exhibitors can react a lot as well to the more boom conditions quicker and more flexibly than credit givers by changing interest sentences or credit borders .
That should reduce the risk of a quick new interpretation of the Vermögenswerte theoretically .
`` We will not awaken of a day and the loans completely re-assess '' , says Gary Perlin , Capital Ones main finance reporter .
Even if a sudden Unterdeckungskrise is improbable in the Kreditkartenmarkt , the risks of a nachhaltigen sharp bank are considerably more real .
If lower house prices and a credit decrease push America into the recession , the industry will stand before a grimmigeren future doubtless .
It of wide Ausschau has held to measure these shark fins .

Staatsschulden will shoot up trillion in year 2009 on one
Every Czech accounts for a state debt of 84000 crowns .
The entire debt climbed until the ending of September in 842,7 billion crowns .
The government had planned to cause itself with 159,2 billion cones this year .
At the beginning of December , the ministry however decreased the plan thanks to the better development of the state striking hold policy on 152,8 billion .
The Czech republic 's Staatsschulden climbed until the ending of September in 842,7 billion crowns .
Within the first nine months of this year , they climbed accordingly about 40,2 billion .
Since June , they have however sunk about 13,4 billion .
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its details about the Staatsschulden of the beginning of October .
Every Czech accounts for a debt of 84000 crowns .
By means of the entire past year , the state caused more than 111 Miliarden crowns .
`` It appears up to now that we will cross the border of a trillion crowns thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year possibly first in year 2009 . ''
Next year the debts should move crowns between 900 billion and a trillion , `` said David Marek , analysts of the Patria Finance , server iHNed.cz . ''
It sees Vladimír Pikora , analyst of the Next Finance similarly : `` We could come to the overstepping of a trillion in the course of year 2009 . ''
When exactly , depends on the next household that we do not yet know .
If should become apparent that the situation changes at the political arena and the politicians should be to save readily more , that could last up to year 2010 .
However I do not come from such a change , `` he noticed . ''
Debts grow
The state debt comes from the debts of the state government and comes above all from the accumulation of deficits of the state household .
The state debt is financed by treasure instructions , state debt orders , direct loans or , for example , by loans of the European investment bank .
The domestic state indebtedness meanwhile climbed this year on 719,4 billion crowns .
The state 's international debts meanwhile climbed about 1,7 billion crowns on 123,3 billion .
At the end of September 803,3 , the so-called marketable state debt attained billion crowns and has sunk since June about 13,7 billion .
The average maturity of the Staatsschulden increased to 6,5 years .
`` The entire debt increased over the year quarter from first to third about 13 percent , which is really a lot in the light of its how well it of the economy goes . ''
It is interesting that the growth is to be recorded above all with the debt orders where increment 20 amounts to percent .
It is bad that the debts climb but on the other hand this shows that one can undertake something , already before the pension reform comes , `` commented on Pikora the data . ''
Better than expected
It comes from the financing strategy and the handling of the Staatsschulden for 2007 that the government for this year had planned to record 159,2 billion crowns .
At the beginning of December , the ministry however decreased the plan thanks to the better development of the state striking hold policy on 152,8 billion crowns .
This amount comes above all from the state budget deficit which will reach 76 billion crowns obviously this year instead of the estimated 91,3 billion .
A ten-billion reserve for paying the pensions concerns it at most planned means for the consolidation agency in height of 13,3 billion crowns further , the financing of Staatsschuldverschreibungen for 43 billion and about installment for the loans at the European investment bank in height of 1,8 billion .

Six as a deterrent trifles in order to anger work colleagues
E mails that we forget to send , language reports that we never receive - harmless lies which do not at all strike ourselves more : They take `` color '' into the everyday life at the workplace .
The question is mere whether one gets used to these small bother or positions himself one the challenge better and attempts this misleadingly , for other angry situations intentionally to vermweiden .
Tips .
`` Sorry , I forgot to align for you that someone called of the marketing department '' - a colleague says .
That one by this means neglected a meeting ?
At best one regrets it and attempts to make up for it again by calling perhaps with the marketing department and admitting reumütig , one would have forgotten to align the report which is the less usual method ) .
.
Before one entangles oneself in embarassing excuses , one should consider with which what one can give and attempt its colleagues really unpleasant moments to avoid these situations intentionally .
Something lent what does not belong to one itself ?
It scarcely gives something sinewy as if one grasps according to a document , Bürozubehör or the telephone , it is not however there .
Yesterday did the notebook device still lie on the desk - early this morning is it away ?
Or does does become reveal believed ballpoint pens to this lost for example on a colleague 's desk ?
Without one should ask lend oneself nothing of the colleagues , for they are annoyed * if they determine that something got away .
Therefore , no envelopes or mail its from the office into the pocket put , for it could meet one itself : none there more if however needs man 's immediately .
Getratsche over the colleagues ' private life ?
There is no effective means , a gossip which has already been put in the world to stop .
Who with whom , which made ?
Where and why ?
One should not tie for each to the nose if possible the information ( or suppositions ) on the colleagues ' private life !
And if someone is however opened and betrays us its innermost secret , we should not misuse this trust !
The best one is as silent a grave instead of just not to align that present ones even if others know information as well about the problems of the colleague .
Reported without reason ill ?
If one calls in the office in order to present himself ill with reference to tormenting headache because one feels just unwell or would only like to rest himself simply , one should realize one : The colleagues must now wear out its own work , unaufschiebbare treatments , projects with fixed deadlines instead of one itself .
The colleague therefore not übel participates !
If one already knows at the Vortag that one will not get it into the office on the next day or that something could interfere why one must stay home , one should report it on time in order that neither the colleagues nor the leader are confronted unexpectedly with the absence .
Hum , tittering , phoning
One is deepened just in its work but is disturbed suddenly by the loud tittering of the colleagues ?
Unintentional a telephone conversation overheard that one better should not have heard ?
One would not supposed to the colleagues with sums , singing , loud conversations ( that one holds beyond their heads ) , tramplings , constant scolding or moaning nerven .
That everything can be very disturbing even if they are not deepened right in a task ( write , plan , organize ) .
Is the other always guilty ?
.
If possible one should not make excuses on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues !
The best one admits its errors for myself and excuses if others were affected by this as well !
The question how one make up for the error again which can make up neglected is only all too appropriate !
In the office - a feelings as home ?
Training pants and Schlapfen : Nothing however lost comfortably home in the office !
Not once one should so dress oneself leger if the job allowed it really !
Become not too slovenly only - one both its colleagues and * as far as should respect that one dresses in the office accordingly - if desirably nicely elegantly , and !

The Spanish private transmitter Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and therefore overtakes its rival Antena 3 .
`` We managed it . ''
With this sentence , the general manager provided of Telecinco , Paolo Vasile , with stock market end its contentment kund . The transmitter led by him had increased its value about the dual of its rival Antena 3 .
.
He emphasized that they in spite of the weak market did not `` all too sink deep . ''
Telecinco concluded yesterday the day with a plus of 2,54 % .
This profit diminishes its previous this year 's losses on 15,66 % .
According to data of Bloomberg , the company value reaches now 4.488,88 million Euro in which case Mediaset is checked the main share of capital ( 52 % ) and Vocento is involved only with 13 % .
The rival Antena 3 lost 1,52 percentage points yesterday and has to register a loss of altogether 40,5 % since January so that its market value with 2.193,46 million amounts to half .
The market value of other stock market noted communication enterprises by contrast climbs ; in the case of Sogecable on 3.571 million , in the case of Prisa ( publishers of the magazine Cinco Días ) on 2.518,53 million and in the case of Vocento on 1.779 million .
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it `` acts two similar enterprises * '' , according to Vasile .
Ungewiss still appears the question to what extent we can in fact act stock market technically at what price and such as we it at the customer level lucrative can make .
Telecinco declared its project a week ago that it rose to the first television transmitter with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising takingses this year . This assured Guiseppe Tringali , the general manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña , the advertising enterprise of the group .
If the project should be turned over , the transmitter would increase by 3,6 % its advertising proceeds in comparison with the 965,4 million from the previous year .
In the case of Antena 3 , the net turnover increased by 1,6 % in the first nine stock market months ( up to 734,4 million ) while the net proceeds from the television business were able to have only a rise of 0,7 % ( 630,4 million ) .
The Analysten see the main factor for the one in the comparison better stock market course of Telecinco in the case of the high Payout Ratio that the company was able to have up to the present time : 2006 caused a 100-prozentige dividend distribution the enterprise managed by Alejandro Echevarría .
.
`` We are obliged for the official compromise to pay at least 50 % of the shares even if we up to now always fundamentally stated more . ''
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year , we were already able to increase the share values of which by purchasing 33 % of the Endemol shares .
After statement of the Analysten , the market has certain loss tendencies currently .
Lehmann Brothers reduced its profit calculation recently by 4 % first in the case of Telecinco for this year and for 2009 by 7 % .
This is the result of the reduction of the probable increment which will diminish 2008 from 10,5 % to 8,4 % and 2009 from 5,5 % to 5,1 % .
This reduced the probable profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 as well by 4,5 % and for 2009 by 7,5 % .

Ibersecurities : puts on its high effective yield and its nachhaltige potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares .

Foods guilty at European inflation
Main reason for the increase in the inflation measured in the Euro-zone is the wildly increasing food prices .

Official prognoses came from only 3 percent , reported Bloomberg .

The climate on the Venus could reveal a view on the future of earth
The Venus was perhaps a pleasant place once for the life , said scientists yesterday .
.
The Venus is the näheste planetary neighbor of earth .
The two worlds possess approximately the same size and have similar planet courses , however the Venus of the sun is somewhat nearer .
Before billion of years would have reigned on the Venus conditions which would have been very similar to these on the earth and could have been even inhabitable , believe scientists today .
However because of the ungebremsten coal dioxide hothouse effect , the erosion of atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotation pace , the Venus pursued a quite different development course .
Today the planet of water is robbed and has a surface temperature which is enough heiss to melt lead and is devastated by Hurrikan strong winches and lightning storms .
The realizations of space probe Venus Express of the European space travel agency which investigated the Planten for a year offer a sobering up look at as the earth could develop in the light of that of catastrophic climate changes .
Professor Fred Taylor of the department physics at the university Oxford shirting , one of the director of the Venus Express mission , said : `` It becomes clear why the climate was is like that different on the Venus to that of earth while the planets are otherwise quite similar to themselves . ''
`` Our new data make it possible to construct a Szenario in which the Venus began before billion of years as the earth , possibly with one of habitable environment . ''

The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the point for the dividing into eighths finale in Milan
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight on the next Tuesday in San Siro for the point that they lack in order still to reach their respective objectives before concluding the Championsleague preliminary match . The Italians need to arrive the point about at the point of their group , during these , decide on their participation with the bulkheads .
.
The two plays of group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth play round as the FC Milan at the FIFA club world championship must begin in Japan where he will fight at the 13ten in the half finale for the first time for the entry into the finale which takes place at the 16ten .
Thus this group will be concluded before all others and the Unentschieden in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to the result expected on all sides even if both teams will attempt to win . The Italians become at home namely not the Keltik Glasgow does does not not want to speculate know which would become them group formerer in the case of a victory and in order that would have a better exit position in the dividing into eighths finale .
A defeat suffices to qualify for the team of Gordon Strachan even when blowing the FC Shakhtar about itself . Nevertheless , he should not all too very trust in such circumstances , for the Ukrainern the participation is entitled to parity in the case of nine points ; these had to be sure lost last week in Glasgow ( 2 1 ) , but were able to win at the second play ( 2 0 ) .
Accordingly , the Milaneses will therefore attempt , the bulkheads the evening to vermiesen . The wiederrum hope to attain the dividing into eighths finale of the altered Championsleague for the second time in sequence after they were defeated at the vorrangehenden play season in exactly the same round by a gate by Kaka at the Nachspielzeit ( 1 0 ) and through a zero too zero Unentschieden on the Hinspiel .
While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of the `` Rossoneri '' , the team will have to concentrate on its own play as both the attainment of the dividing into eighths finale and its membership in the case of the UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow .
The Benfica Lisbon could gain the third place in spite of its lower table position and without the view to be able to continue to participate in the greatest European championship by a victory and , therefore , play a part in the UEFA .

Spectacular repair to the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades of the occupation of the internationals of space station ( ISS ) will have used more than seven hours in the area in order to make the spectacular repair of a faulty sun collector which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work at the station .
A risked exit that on the basis of its duration , the distance from habitable modules , the speed 's with which he was organized and the `` tools '' built by astronauts  '' , to make the repair , several Rekorde achieved . ''
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded module Harmony of the space ferry Discovery , a large zylinderförmiges part which should receive the European and Japanese scientific Labore soon .
This module is a type of landing bridge for the module Labore .
However one must be able to provide them with current .
It was therefore the second task of occupying , 17,5 tons heavy module for the current generation via sun collectors which was already on the ISS to turn over in order to bring it into its final position .
After it had moved it , the occupation made to the restructuring of the sun collectors of the module whose chip width 76 meter is .
And * , it happened that one of the collectors which leave as Akkordeone auffalten was damaged by a jammed cable on a length by approximately a meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not still to damage the collector more .
The astronauts who leave the space ferry Discovery originally for a control procedure and then another sun collectors whose rotation system was incorrect should repair , saw themselves compel to devote themselves to the damaged collector .
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk at the end of the 30-meter-long ferngesteuerten arm of the space ferry which had been mounted on that of the station , round in order to make the repair .
He is one of the best Spacewalker `` ( Wetraumgänger ) of the NASA . ''

When the action was concluded , Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely aufgefaltet before he counted his tools and returned into the station .

President of the Federal Council base charcoal-burner worries about the reputation of Germany and asked the large coalition to conclude the fight about the reception of the Dalai lama .
`` We should present no split nation to the outside world in this question '' , said charcoal-burners for the trade leaf .
At the same time signaled charcoal-burners understanding of the reception of the Dalai lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) in September .
`` The human rights have for me universal validity even if I have respect for the diversity of the cultures '' , said charcoal-burners .
Each knows that Germany must protect sensitive balances in the foreign policy , the President of the Federal Council emphasized but took Merkel before the accusation in protection , it pursues a new China policy .
`` This Chancellor did not take interval by the traditional one-China policy . ''
That knows China '' , said charcoal-burners as well . ''
Foreign minister Frank Walter Steinmeier ( SPD ) had revealed indirectly displeasure on the reception of the Dalai lama and had therefore been attacked from series of the union .
Steinmeier had complained the `` display window policy '' of the union among other things in the foreign policy .

Small Saarland , good development
The smallest state is leading with the job training and shines even with the international orientation of its universities .
.
`` I hab ' yesterday the 50. time one of non-Saar countries declare that we are not Frenchmen '' - the smallest state placards this slogan self-ironically for its 50. birthday .
France and Luxembourg play a large role in this in the educational system of the Saarland which is Cologne ( IW ) in the educational monitor of the institute of the German economy on place five .
Thus the universities already co-operate narrowly with the neighbor countries from tradition .
The university in Saarbru4cken was founded 1948 by the Frenchmen .
Until today , students can conclude here their study with a double or even triple diploma .
The share of foreign students with 15,6 percent is high accordingly .
However the Saarland in number above average brings even the state children to the universities - many to the high school of them without a conclusion .
`` In the Saarland , one uses the professional educational system '' , tells Axel Plünnecke educational expert in the case of the IW .
More than every fifth youngster its study authorization acquires in a job school in order that the Saarland lies more than seven percentage points over the federal average .
Even the possibilities of combination of professional and academic training are expanded comparatively strongly .
Measured against population number the equipment with binary study procedures is this second best in Germany .
In spite of the practical training and increasing demand , the number of Ingenieurabsolventen however sank in the past years about a third .
Therefore the Saarland educational ministry committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineer scientific fields now .
`` In the general formative schools , we activated a few reforms according to the first Pisa study '' , says a speaker of the educational ministry .
Thus the government introduced country-wide comparison tests .
In order that the children earlier the last Kita 's learn to begin be free-of-charge - a model that even other states copy meanwhile .

The fathers the plant skirts return
Germany 's super group of the seventies makes music again : The three band members of Harmonia planned their consoles with a concert in Berlin again .
To the Revival , a Mitschnitt from their large time `` live 1974 '' appears .
They were already fundamentally more famous then abroad .
The scheduled sensation then happens in shape of three set gentlemen at the evening board .
Each has his box before himself , its cables and above all its buttons .
Dieter Moebius thront in the blossom white shirt in 63 years in the middle .
To the left of 57 years flank young and in the possession of Laptop and guitar by Michael Rother .
To the right , looks at from auditorium , Hans Joachim Roedelius , 73 bends , concentrated at the console .
Each contributes noises , now and then even a Beat .
And sometimes , it adds music to itself inadvertently to a conventional piece .
That appears not then to disturb even the gentlemen himself .
That the band Harmonia makes music again ensured among plant skirt lovers some excitement .
In which case one may uncover here : Aimed demands showed that the name to be sure whirred through the collective pop memory but to miss according to nachhaltig about this band by no means for 32 years schmerzlich .
However why should even the German not celebrate his existing legends from the seventy years ?
Especially since what is called misleadingly plant skirt was always more valid in England and America than in its own country .
When the music economy awarded the that survive of the Cologne group Can 2003 the echo prize for the life plant , one saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces .
When ! also thanked the Red Hot Chili Peppers newly in the Laudatio the bands La Du4sseldorfs and , the astonishment knew no borders .
.
The problem of the ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the stranger is that one .
The memory is already therefore overtaxed with Harmonia because the trio unfolded only two years a far smaller effect power as well existed and in this time than one allocated to them subsequently by others .
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music clusters with the artist Conrad Schnitzler previously under the a lot promising name .
First , one played in the cellar under the Berlin stage .
After that , for on in Du4sseldorf , for economic reasons from the church supported Plattenlabel .
Rother had helped out briefly in power station and then ! as a Gitarrist in the case of new , the then perhaps most radical German group , a call erspielt .
Rother however followed the cluster musicians in the exile about 1973 following forest in the Weserbergland .
They lived there , in the altos Weserhof , a ruin from the 16. century , as a city fleeting Kommunarden .
Less ideologically as in the municipality I where Roedelius was still allowed to be tormented as a nanny .
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist present .
Supposedly a pennant of the song organization Harmonia Ottenstein was also found in the bar garbage and for art a name .
Some recorded Harmonia from that .
The first album was called `` music of Harmonia '' and the following `` De Luxe '' .
For like that left and also summon sounded music that band suffered material need .
The Selbstfindung did not serve the brushwood collection only .
The CD `` live 1974 '' appeared now was recorded with a concert in Griessem , 50-köpfigen record wings before one barely as someone believes to be remembered .
The wish came from Rother then to force Harmonia and to practise it occasionally .
.
The band explained 1975 their separation .
Rother landed in the Esoterisch spherical one and secured itself its existence with albums such as `` blazing heart '' .
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than Harmonia was ever .
The Griessemer live album is to be owed Herbert Grönemeyer .
.
Newly ! dug already became as Roedelius solo plant .
The physical Wiederauferstehung of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world .
Subsidizes publicly , in the context of festival Woldtronics .
Julian Cope is there , the Briton , old punk and author of the reference manual `` plant skirt samplers '' .
Dr. moth Loveparade inventor is also present .
With which the entire band width of the influences of the plant skirt on following pop music would be outlined .
Of Harmonia , the blank of the super group is filled out .
The sentence of Brian Eno hovers with the most peculiar Sounds in the hall : `` Solely true music , the future belongs to her . ''
There are pictures which show the producers with Harmonia in the farmer room .
Projection of further black and white photos of wirr wired up equipment serve for the putting final development for wired up equipment .
In front of that , the three veterans are concerned with the improvisation again .
No longer by adhering microphones to the organ and to the blow stuff in order to elicit from the instruments via unerhörte even built effect devices tones .
Electronic music such as electronic music appears today .
Three in the technical deepened Tüftler .
The chorus of the house also alters nothing in this .
Under line Barbara morning star one coughs under Soundwolken and whispered and sung at a well place with emphasis `` Aaaaaaaah ! `` .
Plant skirt was always yes a very English concept .
It never concerned skirt .
The roots were searched for less in blues , as in music universities ( Can ) , technologies ( power station ) , fleeing or before artistic and social conventions ( cluster ) .
The one who `` calls '68 ! '' '' here does not `` have quite unjustly and Harmonia can not from that be brought even now from the rest . ''
The most obvious one is still thought over thoroughly at the arena .
Where does music begin and does when it stop ?
That can rob the nerves for one or give presents fleeting moments of great luck .

The accusation against the Banker - the `` NatWest '' named `` three '' - asserts that they came in year 2000 to Houston in order to hatch one deceptive plot with Fastow and its former Topberater Michael Kopper .
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a daughter society of a partnership of Enron which was checked by Fastow who was the architect of innumerable deceptive Enron machinations which contributed to tearing the company into the bankruptcy swirl .

The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former executive board chairman Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of their roles in context with the Enron collapse .
Skilling sits out a punishment of more than 24 for years .
Lays convictions of conspiracy , deception and other accusation points became futile after he died last year because of heart affliction .

Test Peugeot 207 1.6 sw VTi : Voruteile fades
In order to say the truth that I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206 .
Its driving characteristics were not a lot worth , the quality of the gearshift , one was able to describe as rather sub-average for the control as well as the processing .
However now its successor , Peugeot 207 are , on the market and this is about much better .
The station wagon with the designation sw is another piece further and only remains for me to revise my opinion .
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of the 207 , I had to complain myself for example over the head liberty that is too small on the rear seats .
There are now no longer these complaints , for the car body of the station wagon is formed in such a way that even two meter men will not suffer .
Quickly further
I go through the internal equipment only briefly in order not too very much to repeat me .
It concerns a rightly successful design where I have objections only because of the kümmerlichen medium tunnel .

The seats are comfortable and past are the times where we possibly complained about too short seats or head rests .
Even the side hold fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206 .
Regarding the space offer , one can feel the enlarged measurements of the car body here as well .
In the station wagon , the lack that is already mentioned of head liberty is also remedied .
Suitcases in the trunk
The main point on this car is however the load room .
I ( even because of the unfoldable reverse window ) must describe that as very well loadable and space-saving .
.
They do not disturb , leave auseinanderziehen and establish even more difficult objects .
However , we talk about the drawer volume .
It amounts to according to table in basic equipment 428 liters , which is a rather average value in comparison with the competition .
However not in comparison with vehicle of this class best-selling in the Tschechien , Skoda Fabia Combi .
If we compare for the 207 sw with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav , we determine that the Peugeot stays behind by clearly marked 52 liters .
.
.
120 PS in four series
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline motor with lift area 1,6 liter and a performance by 88 kW .
And honestly , said , a 1600 Kubik motor should appear that a family Hatchback actuates .
He is low , has a small consumption and pulls away well .
If I compare him with its counter piece in the case of Skoda who sometimes affects than its exhaust with a rag would be stopped up , then I can only be inspired by him .
The price list says volumes
The price of this car is not just national .
But we must remember that we tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good motor .
The basic price of the car with the 1400er gasoline motor in height of 329900 crowns still concerns .
With our motor it costs from 410900 crowns , which is already quite a lot .
Equipment Premium of the test car again hits with 80000 crowns in addition to beech .
We however had Kopfairbags , automatic air conditioning , automatic windshield wiper release , electrical window lifter rear and and ...
Thus the car costs by and large simple 531900 crowns .
That is a lot , however the additional equipment of a Fabia adds up you once and you will arrive with a very similar sum .
Therefore only the decision remains what brand one wants to choose .

Fixed days are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary , holidays are exactly regulated legally so that the procedure for the reorganization of the work days meanwhile was established all around the holidays , however the coming year of less such days give presents us .
In the EU as well and in America , one understands for something else by `` holiday '' .
The Hungarian right system differentiates between state holidays and work free days .
Work free days are usually ecclesiastical holidays or are related to significant historical events .
We celebrate New Year as well , for example : Both the last day is can rest the old work free days - latter alone already thus the ones the that celebrate and the first day of the new year New Years Eve .
In the whole year , we have a total of fourteen holidays .
The state holidays are 15 . March which reminds of the revolution of 1848 and 23 . October , the intending day of the revolution of 1956 .
On the 20 . August , the state foundation is celebrated , on the 1 . May the work , on the 1. and 2 . November , we intend our dead ones .
Furthermore there are two holidays to Easter , Pentecost and Christmas .
Since our state , national or religious holidays rarely fall on a week-end , the procedure for the `` work day shift '' proved itself in the cases in which we would work only a day before or after the holiday .
The price of the lengthened week-ends is however that we must in front of that quite probably work on the Saturdays or must go to school .
When this day which fells before or after the holiday should be processed last finally , it has been established by the work secretary in its own regulation for long years .
The right regulation is likewise valid for all employers and employees , for public employees and civil servants of the public service .
Only companies and installations in which the business is continued without interruption , therefore also on the holidays , are excluded .
Pay is brought the work order something only by the holidays at the end of the year confused : The life stops from the 24 . December positively in this country as most for the days take specially time adjustment or for that the this canceled vacation between Christmas and New Years Eves .
In the next year , more holidays fall into the week middle or on the end of the week so that there will be less Umdisponierungen at the work days , than this year .
The calendar is at first `` put on the head '' all around the day of the work in order that people can stay equal to four days at the piece home .
Saturday , the 26 . April become a work day in order that the Friday , 2 . May can be a day of rest .
The second Umdisponierung is connected with the holiday on the 23 . October : On Saturday , the 18 . October , one will have to process the Friday , 24 . October first .
The end of the year will however be remainderloosely in the sign of the holidays after from the 24 . December everything lies and stops even if New Years Eve fells on a Wednesday .

Because of less valency feelingses , deceptive broker risked billion
Bottomless swindler
Thus the French bank giant Société Générale , owner of the local Komercní banka calls its former employees Jerome Kerviel .
It namely came on his account about almost five billion Euro .
It however appears rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a large player who wanted to put it his colleague immediately , surely was not furthermore incapable .
In contrast to all large bank houses , he recognized the crisis punctually by the amerikanischenn mortgage market .
`` He is psychically more weak , '' it was to be heard from the mouth of its superior who reported him to the police .
As is however apparent from statements Kerviels which published the French media , for example daily paper Le moons , he was a person who had achieved at the end of last year with its businesses profits amounting to 1,6 billion Euro .
Crisis not only in America
`` Everything what he wanted , money was to be earned for my bank , '' he asserts in his statement .
In the summer , it had succeeded in profiting one half billion Euro right from the American crisis .
He had namely already spotted the opportunity in addition at the year beginning .
In February , there were quite first reports about that that so-called Sub Prime mortgages as they are given income weak customers or such which had payment problems already earlier , into difficulties would be fallen .
Influence on the entire economy should have this crisis however not .
Kerviel did not believe that and kept right .
At the end of the year , he had his profit high screwed except for 1,6 billion Euro .
`` Had already as I this first half billion earned , I did not know as I should explain that , '' admit Kerviel and say further that he kept nothing definitive to himself .
During the entire interrogation , he admits that he forged documents , in order that one would not come for him to the tricks .
He even succeeded in leading his leaders behind the light even if the Eurex stock market was interested gradually in its businesses .
Risk profit
Did fear to fly up him ?
Probably scarcely .
`` I thought that it satisfies the simple fact that I earned for the bank 1,6 billion . ''
From where did he take the courage to risk so a lot ?
He had to develop his position for himself gradually .
He stepped into the Société Générale in year 2000 , direct after he had concluded on , his studying at the University of Lyon .
Its year salary amounted to approximately 51000 dollar .
After two years , he was already assistant of a broker and he of independent brokers with a year content of 90000 dollar became in year 2005 .
Nevertheless , he knew that he will never earn as much as others .
`` I knew already with my first conversation in year 2005 that one observed me . ''
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development , `` explained Kerviel the investigation civil servant . ''
However the first large success came already soon after its entry .
With the alliance 's shares , he earned lot of by having depended one half billion Euro on course loss of this title with the London bomb strokes .
And the release was that - now he wanted more .
Solang it profit makes , we leave you
`` That is as a snow ball , '' he told the policemen .
However the leaders supposedly knew about everything or suspected it .
`` As long as I earned money , schloss one the eyes . ''
However however then the great blow came at the beginning of this year .
On a single day , he all lost billion Euro .
On a week-end in mid January , he wanted to balance that .
When he came to work on Monday , he was employee of the bank no longer .
And the bank announced a couple of days later that it lost five billion Euro on his account .
And how did they come for him to the tricks ?
He made suspicious for himself through a vacation .
`` I took only four days of the previous year . ''
A broker who takes no vacation is one which does not want that one sees for him in the tickets , `` Kerviel finally said . ''

Political Capital : Hungarian guard increases state risk
According to the department for risk analysis ( Risk Analysing division ) of Political Capital , the activities of the Hungarian guard founded in this August with support of the `` movement for a better Hungary '' lifted Hungary and the region 's risk in several respect .
It is been statement in the institute 's `` risk warning report '' among other things : The highest political risk the `` increase of the already existing ethnischen tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary which could lead even at short notice to violent ethnischen confrontations '' represents in context with the Hungarian guard 's activities .
The strategy of the Hungarian guard who aims supposedly at the provocation of such a confrontation thus is main reason for that the research institute .
As reported , this is seen persons responsible in this politically as a failure of sides : `` People of the public life left representatives of radical political groupings the discussion of the Roma question which were now based their political strategy on the Roma Hungary contrast '' .
One supposes that this intensify the problem , make the rational dialog impossible , extremities would favor as well as increase the probability of violent confrontations .
The Forschungsinsitut not least of all `` considerably '' means `` harmfully '' thanks to the enormous attention of sides of the indigenous and foreign media , `` Hungary 's picture abroad '' ausserdem which would have activities of the Hungarian guard '' , what the trust in the stability and democratic ripeness affects particularly '' .
We remember : Since fall 2006 , the re-organization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been continuous in the lift so that , since summer 2007 , several have been founded organizations naming `` national self-defense organization '' .
`` It is mean to these groupings that they in each case define as a civil organization while they boast openly about this , their members on - armed now and then - to prepare defense tasks ( catastrophe protection , state defense , Ordnungshütung ) , with reference to the police 's unsuitability the police 's , the army or the state himself '' , it was called .
And further : In accordance with that method which attempts , that everything occurs passed away political efforts based on the policy and party peevishness of the population as a middleclass initiative to tarnen .
The emphasis of the civil character and the organization form therefore serve for the avoidance of legal hurdles which could emerge in the course of the entry at court only - there is not a political strategy at the same time .
As one must find in the analysis , the activities present a risk-increasing factor to the Hungarian guard for the relations with the neighbor states as well .
`` In the last months , the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighbor states as a potenzielle danger source , the confirmation of its own antiHungary policy so sees some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighbor countries in the arising of the Hungarian guard . ''
That everything has effects on the political stability of the region `` - it was called . ''
.
As reported , the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian national guard are comparable , the foundation of which was announced in August 2007 by the right extreme Bulgarian national union ( BNU ) .
In the background of the Bulgarian guard 's arising , the Roma mass riotings which took place in a district from Sofia ( Krasna Poljana ) were .
The BNU took the occurrences right to the cause for founding the national guard , with the argument that the objective of the organization the `` national protection '' is .
In your opinion , the state was however remained noticeable inactive and indifferent for years a regular `` gypsy terror '' in Bulgaria namely in the past 17 - Political Capital so .
And further : The initiative would have stepped away a violent debate in the Bulgarian public .
As said that the increased risk for ethnische confrontations is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to resistance tacks .
Since the Hungarian guard 's activities show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian national guard to date , it is not to be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react , with the organization of their own protection to the threats , it is been statement in the risk warning report of Political Capital .
Attila Juhász , research director in the case of Political Capital said on inquiry of the report office : The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute .
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and risk-changing tendencies should be recognizable , the public opinion is informed , as in the fall by handing over the Risikowarnberichtes .

Hopes that the central banks the interests the Weltaktienmärkte will reduce leads to the rise
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic after market hopes that the central bank will attempt to calm the credit markets by further interest lowerings , was strengthened by soothing commentaries by vice-chairmen of the US central bank .
The share markets rose in London , New York and in the whole of Europe after Donald barge , number 2 of Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the central bank , said that the policy must react `` flexibly and pragmatic '' to the continuous pressure on the finance markets .
To calm markets vexed in a clear effort , in the light of sign of rising credit tensions , the most recent turbulences would `` partly have reversed some of the improvements in the market functions '' Kohn said `` from the late part of the September and October '' .
If the increased turbulence exists remains , it increased the possibility of a further increase of the financial conditions of consumers and enterprises , he said .
The commentaries were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and to stabilize the credit conditions with new capital injections in the US markets and possible further interest lowerings .
.
The consequences of the financial turbulences became by the announcement of Bear Stearns , the Investmentbank , emphasized that it will remove 650 jobs or 4 percent of their world-wide employees , in a measure for the cost reduction in order to cover serious losses from their lost bets in the US Hypothekenkreditesektor .

In many cases one saves at disinfectants
.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals , the practising inheritance placing of the beds , the overloading of personnel - everything factors which are not precisely zuträglich for the damming of the infections , so the leading doctor of the national Epidemiologiezentrums .
In many cases one saves in the case of the disinfectants as well .
In the Traumatologie department of the János hospital , a MRSA infection was diagnosed recently .
That against antibiotic resistente bacterium was found in a male patient who was delivered to the hospital after a serious accident .
The patient was insulated .
At the beginning of the year , there was already a similar infection here .
.
Until 10 . December of this year , infections initiated by multiresistente virus were reported from hospitals 1094 at the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system , so the leading doctor of the national Epidemiologiezentrums , Karolina Böröcz .
Infections initiated by multiresistente virus were therefore registered so much , in the hospitals for certain , the true figure might however be higher .
Approximately two thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) were triggered by the MRSA , that against Methicillin Oxacillin resistenten Staphylococcus aureus .
.
Sa limited infections ( sore throat , tonsillitis , ignitions of the skin or wounds as for example ) usually react well to antibiotics , they are heilbar well .
If the means are however measured out too high or used inexpertly , respondierenden bacteria antibiotic resistente which spread out in the hospitals quickly under corresponding conditions result from that well .
In the case of patients with weakened or durably badly functioning immune systems , but also at age or patients with small body weight can cause these bacteria difficult infections , as for example wound infection or blood poisoning , therefore sepsis .
The MRSA infection is belongs nothing special , such occurrences for the medical director according to of the János hospital , to the Krankehausalltag .
One may confuse the infection with the epidemic , manhte Tibor Nyulasi - there is not only MRSA there where it is not looked for .
Resistent against antibiotics
`` Such patients are insulated , the maintenance personnel Gummihandschuhe and masks carry with the supply and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment '' - Tibor Nyulasi so .
.
Test takings too rare
The majority of the infections initiated by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable , however the currently reigning conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the Eindämmung of the arising or the expansion of the multiresistenten virus , say Karolina Böröcz .
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes , the hospitals should investigate the delivered patients and insulate MRSA-infizierte immediately .
In the Hungarian hospitals , the microbiological test taking is not however so frequently practiced .
Not least of all , because there is vonseiten of the state ill cash-register no allowances for this investigation .
Most cases would come along only then to the light of day if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection , so the medical manager of the Epidemiologiezentrums .
Vonseiten there are strict recommendations for the European union , to the corresponding application of antibiotics in the humane medicine , there are however guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and Krankheitsbilder in Hungary as well .
Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful that is , microbiological investigations are necessary in order that no resistance to the means can develop , this general instruction of hospitals is always complied with not as well .
Under out-patient or in the basic supply the patients , microbiological test takings are even even more rarely , so Karolina Böröcz .
Is saved in the case of the disinfectants
Verify scientific proofs that MRSA is transferred from a patient on the other the most frequently by the maintenance personnel .
Therefore the hand washing or the wear of gloves and masks is just of a great significance , however there are considerable deficiencies in the hospitals in this area as well .
MRSA is transferred by droplet infection or contact , in the indigenous hospitals , it is not however always possible to insulate the infizierten patients .
The rooms even often are overfilled , the beds connected barely although there should be a distance from at least 1,5 meter between them from epidemiologischer sight .
As Karolina Böröcz continues to mark , it unfortunately even occurs financially for less well placed hospitals into that that one saves in the case of disinfectants , there are few male nurses , many patients - everything factors which favor the arising of infections absolutely .
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further distribution of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are observed , so Karolina Böröcz .
Government program against MRSA
To get MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs for the health insurance , therefore they are fought everywhere .
In England for example , the prevention of MRSA or their Eindämmung in the government program were recorded .
After first signs , the program is successful - published data as occupy , are the tendency of the MRSA infections in England declining .
The European center for medical prevention ( ECDC ) declared the prevention of the arising of multiresistenten viruses ( ( under this , even MRSA ) as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities .

Germans threaten 2007 wage minuses
In spite of the strong economic situation , a real wage loss threatens German employees of a prognosis according to this year .
.
According to a calculation of the Hans Böckler foundation , the employed 2007 could calculate in real terms with less on the content account as in the previous year .
`` The modest wage evolution , the value-added tax raise and the price pushes are guilty on that with foods and energy '' , Gustav horn of the institute for macro economy and economic situation research of the `` picture newspaper '' said .
New burdens could approach with the unemployed insurance as well employees .
Finance secretary Peer Steinbrück said for the `` newest Osnabrueck newspaper '' , the planned Absenkung of the unemployed insurance is to be sure correct and rational on 3,3 percent to the turn of the year in the present situation .
However , the federal agency for work may not come into embarrassment again to have to ask for credits or allowances at the alliance , the SPD politician was quoted .
It had become known on Tuesday that the price explosion has driven the inflation rate for years with foods and crude oil products on the highest state for 13 .
The prices altogether increased in comparison with the year about 3,0 percent .

Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries deliberate on the schedule of Bali in which the emission reducing measures for the time to 2012 , therefore are established at the end of the Kyoto protocol .
Currently a violent debate is in operation between industrial and developing countries .
The USA has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers , however they would be ready until to reduce 2020 by 25 40 percent the hothouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990 .
The other large question of the conference is whether the Industriestaaten are ready to support the developing countries both financially technologically in addition to the reduction of the emissions and .
.
That the Kyoto protocol is assumed managed adaptation funds by a 16-köpfigen Council , probably in the case of the UN 's global environment facility ( GEF ) as is to be read in the `` Piac és profit '' .
Hungary 's six percent
Minister for the environment Gábor Fodor supports in the name of Hungary the effort of the EU in keeping its outrider role with global climate protection measures and until to achieve 2009 a new international agreement .
The secretary explained who the hothouse gas emissions will reduce EU by 20 % until 2020 ( measured against the values of 1990 ) , independent of whether the `` agreement '' is achieved successfully `` according to 2012 '' or . The union would is be even ready to support a 30-prozentige reduction soferne other large Industriestaaten of the world or developing countries ready too to fulfill its obligations responsibly to measure forces and .
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the objective of the states , the 1997 had joined the Kyoto protocol , a reduction of only 5,2 percent was whereas the EU with then had already agreed its 15 member states to a minus of 8 % .
The guideline for Hungary is reduction of the hothouse gas emissions 1985 87 about 6 % in comparison with the years - a guideline that the country will quite meet as one must read in the ministry 's of the environment press communication .
The use is high on Bali - in any case the long-term international climate political agreement must be finished within two years , otherwise it would become effective for certain only to 2012 . In this instance no renewed , international emission reduction system would follow the reduction projects established in the Kyoto protocol , international scientific climate change committee of the UN distinguished with the Nobel Peace Prize emphasized the meaning of which the IPCC , the one as well in its most recent report .
By this means the emission reduction would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the earth more than 2°C would be unavoidable , which would result in extremely grave and irreparable consequences according to Wissenschaftern .

Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal reserve , the European central bank and the Zentralbanken Great Britain , Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the crisis on the finance markets .
Thus will reach the currency markets more than 100 billion dollars by means of auctions .
On these auctions , the banks auction interest sentences they himself are to be lent readily mutually money to which .
For example , the American Fed 40 billion dollars send on auction further 24 makes them loose for the European and the Swiss central bank .
There after the strokes of the 11.September , is the first time that the Zentralbanken of the individual states agree on such a coordinated procedure for the defense or Abmilderung of the consequences of a finance crisis .
`` This step should remove the greatest difficulties of the economy , therefore '' wrote in a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl from the consultation company Economic Outlook Group `` the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can loan '' .
`` The coordinated action of the Zentralbanken decreased from 65 % to approximately 50 % the probability of a recession in the USA , '' added Baumohl in its report .
The banks lost billion dollars because of not served credits already at 60 , above all in the United States .
Analysts expect even further billion losses .
The Zentralbanken must have been afraid really of this , which can still follow everything when were decided on this procedure , `` the leader economist said of ABN Amro , Kieran Davies . ''
`` It appears that the situation is really bad , '' he said further .
The Zentralbanken have become the fear that if the banks have seriously themselves access to loans credits even more expensive for their customers .
That would decrease the consumption and the American economy rushes into a recession , possibly with effects on the economic growth in the entire world .
The Zentralbanken decided themselves on this after they had not succeeded Interbankzinssatz which is used with the money distribution between banks to in lower the so-called LIBOR the Londoner .
That means that the banks were afraid constantly to lend themselves mutually money that although the Zentralbanken of the USA , Canada and Great Britain had lowered their interest sentences during the fall repeatedly .
`` That will as have the same effect a further Absenkung of the interest sentences , '' consulting told the agency Reuters Greg Salvaggio of tense .
Some Analysten are of the opinion that this step of the Zentralbanken toward warming up the crisis contributes because he does not solve the fundamental problem that is the case of the real estate market in the USA .

Bulgaria , the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabelhaft - the whole of Europe looks attentively at the Balkan State mentioned earlier rarely .
What where and who buys , at the EU 's most proper still market which becomes more expensive wildly ?
.
Bulgaria is zweifelsohne the most coveted plaster for real estate purchases in the East European area currently , with favorable ski apartments and houses at the sea .
Between the mountains , the regions Bansko , Borovec , Pamprovo and Vitosa belong to that most condescended , Albena , the `` gold coast '' , the `` sun coast '' and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar are the Renner at the sea , however real estates are more and more as well in demand all around Kavarna and Balcik .
Attract according to estimates of Re . Analysten in Bulgaria wid also of the state inner early or late investors , Veliko Tarnovo , Gabrovo , Elena and Triavna more buyers as , for example record and also the noticeably favorable area of soot .
The capital of Sofia offers enticing offers as well - trade and office areas offer highest yields .
Bulgaria is to be become one of the most attractive European Golferparadiese on the best way and tourists therefore attracted next to the summer and winter season in the other two seasons as well .
Therefore Vorausschauende investors already purchase now in the great style , for example all around Bansko .
According to Analysten , people who acquire real estates in Bulgaria aims at a change of their life change as well .
Most buyers are Englishmen , business prospects however also come from France , Belgium , Spain and more and more from Rumania .
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are present too while there are Russian buyers in the case of the Black Sea and in the ski areas predominantly .
There are three groups of foreign buyers , Georgij Jankov says regional director of Re . Bulgarias .
That which want to lower buy either revitalisierte real estates by 50100.000 Euro or descended houses by 515.000 Euro that they then renovate themselves .
Good tying and Erreichbarkeit as well as communication possibilities are capitalized but even the closeness is decisive for the buyers to a city , businesses and doctors .
That which are in search following a vacation domicile ( Bulgaria was listed for vacation objectives of the Germans in December under the Top Ten ) belong to the second category .
The third group is arranged by business people which invest with the objective of a medium- to long-term value increase .
Real estates in the capital are caused by the always growing demand meanwhile continuously more expensively .
Within the EU , the real estate prices are to be sure the lowest in Bulgaria , in the past five years , there was 21 percent .
The price increase with the real estate prices crosses by far the increase of the salaries .

Popular will Mondays Fridays have opened its 200 credit institutes 12 hours on the day .
Popular decided to modernize a large part of its branches .
Altogether 200 from that is settled in the economic strongest regions of Spain .
These branch offices mean a large milestone to the institute which operates on max . under the brand name Popular .
Also , however , for the remaining Spanish institutes , since Popular as a first bank group represents dares the leap to lengthen the opening hours of its branches wochentags to 20.30h and Saturdays to apply them from 10h to 20.30h .
The bank group BBVA which is repeatedly reported the extension of their opening hours as well lies in the branch offices , still made no definitive decision up to now .
.
Lie adjacent further banks of the new initiative , for the business opening hours anpasst , will depend on the empirical values of the Popular bank .
And that is just the intention that Popular pursues with its project as well .
It is the objective to lengthen the opening hours of those branches that even which of large department stores can , but cover the purchasing gay clientele of independent , small and central enterprises on the basis of its situation .
The bank would like to open the new 200 branch places in the course of the coming 18 months as it concerns not new but changed opening hours .
For that , the bank will alter the rooms of those branch offices which are already situated in business zones and adapt them at the same time to the individual customer profile of the various zones .
Thus the expansion of the opening hours is connected with a new space design of the branches which are distinguished through a more current , more colorful design .
.
The branch offices which will be equipped even with additional rooms for the KMU will sell no financial products .
A positive experience for the group
Popular has tried its concept already over nine branches in Madrid .
And the empirical values fell out positively , so Ángel Rivero .
The branch offices of the roads bravo Murillo , O´Donell and grain Vía were selected for that , what appears to have been a clever resolve .
Popular manages approx . 2500 branch offices momentarily .
And further 60 which operate on under the name Mundocredit . These specialize in immigrants and have expanded opening hours as well , even on Sundays and holidays .
In these branches of PopularMax , the model of the BBVA is not used as most of them instead will offer a wide selection to non-finance services for the sale .
`` We would like to represent no competition for our customers '' , explain Rivero .
With Telefonica , they came preliminary to the agreement to sell mithilfe of externally bank personnel mobile phones .

Hurt of the Labour party
Gordon Brown discovered another further hole to the Hineinfallen ; its path from this this remains same * .
For British scandals , this is not specially slippery .
No nobility titles seem sold , Parisian pays no politician for hotel calculations to have been sucked no illegitimate toes .
However the Aufdeckung that a rich businessman disguised over four years under the name of other people contributions to the British ruling Labour party over more than 650.000 pound ( 1.3 million dollars ) and that the party neglected to report this , is would somewhat have gotten along without that of the umkämpfte Gordon Brown well .
When two months ago the minister-president had avoided the demand for a choice , the intelligence of the Britons insultingly in dämliche way by having asserted that opinion inquiries would not have influenced this decision , there was hope that he would offer a sturdy , efficient government .
Instead , such as Vince Cable , this in increasing measure sharp ingenious representation chairmen this liberally democrats , it expressed , the Brown feared once developed from Stalin to Mr. Bean .
The clumsy rescue of Northern skirt , a hit bank , showed regulatory weakness and bad judgement capital under fire .
Bad set proposals for the change in the control laws thought through have enterprise associations against the government .
The control official loss of individual data of 25 million persons demonstrated unvorstellbare administrative Pfuschereien .
A trio of generals in the retirement started for a rebellion in the upper house from protestation against reductions of soldier outputs : To be secretary of the armed forces , they asserted , a part time job is .
Now there are the diverse contributions of David Abrahams ; Peter Watt , Labours general secretary ( and their former fulfillment director ) have already stepped back .
Nothing from that means that , Brown irrevokably , direction breaks up withdrawal .
Nevertheless , governments can reach a turning point according to which they feel it impossibly to rule .
Neither like nor does people trust politicians , however do they normally hold back their scepticism if a new troop takes the office .
If it is clear once that it is improbable that a Prime Minister improves the situation and he does not yet need be once for a long time , this opening past : the public service begins become undicht ; begin the cabinet secretaries chat ; the press looks for bad reports ; and the government becomes defensive and objectiveless .
In a manner , the position of Brown is specially difficult because he can not assert in contrast to other political leaders that he is a new broom .
He Tony Blair would so like to deny , he was his upper second lieutenant .
The problems with Northern skirt and that control competence documents , for example , hang together with decisions that Brown made as a chancellor of the Ministry of Finance .
And even if this the voters were do not not possibly involved come directly in Blairs misfortunes - as in the case of the long `` money for nobility title investigation '' of political party financing - from this that he was it .
In spite of this , Browns situation is not completely so bad , looks like them
The offenses are not as awful as the conservatives describe it .
As , in the case of Mr. Bean , no one died , or was cheated completely .
And the antidote , painful such as it is , it is to be delivered , which stalinistische tendencies always promised Browns naturally : A reliable sturdily and slightly brutal government .
The new fuss about political contributions is a good example .
The garboeske Abrahams which compares its contributions with its gifts beneficial to the public says wishes him no public recognition for its well disposed .
That perhaps like that is but he was not entitled to the decision on this .
The laws against Anonymität for large political contribution payers are clear and they exist for a clear reason : the public has to know a right to that who can buy for himself access to this which rules the country .
Watts known which would says have him about Abrahams arrangement but not that it is illegal , will have to position itself some questions obviously ; just so Jon Mendlesohn , Labours main finance one drivers which was told over the separate contributions in October .
However up to now Brown is not involved : There is nothing that after that indicates that he knew about these confusions although the largest part of the payments was made after its office takeover in June .
Up to now the Prime Minister accomplished half of the work .
.
In this instance the `` teachings to be pulled out of '' this are not very much complicated .
If the law was broken , it is a thing for the police .
Aside from the fact it must gives make other things Mr. Brown how to find something a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in the public life who has been vacant for six months and to advance with a drastic reform of political party financing .
That would become requires to co-operate of the Hardlinern of the Labour with the conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relation with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party accomplice such as Mr. Brown .
However he should be conscious of some partial facts .
The conservatives have a clear direction now in the opinion inquiries ; he has to regain two years about voters ; and the only path as he can reach a victory is through unanfechtbare Rechtschaffenheit and sturdy competence .

Cuba - nicest island of the Caribbean
.
What you always expect from your vacation will be fulfilled if you only select the correct one .
Golden and white beaches , high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond .
Palms and All inclusive with waiters who offer pizza , ice at the beach and of deceiving cocktail .
Kitesurfing , gulf and roulette .
On the islands of the Caribbean , you find that in überreichlichem measure .
.
The Spaniard its bast ion for the capture of America was for Cuba currently .
Kolumbus called it the nicest place that saw each individual human eye .
Havanna became a warehouse once or passage warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards in America had robbed and then transported to Europe .
And then , the American epoch came .
The hotel Nacional completely resulted at the end of the 20. century .
Building left it one of the leaders of the American Mafia , Lucky Luciano , for everything that was considered a crime in the USA ( specially during the prohibition ) was seen with pleasure on Cuba and supports - drugs , luck play , prostitution .
Were among its guests among other things
Winston Churchill , Ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
In Havanna , high houses grew , over the wide boulevards of car go which were part of the cult symbols of the fifties of the past Jahrhundets .
.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio , their signatures left behind cataract of the Showbusiness and politicians from the whole of America .
And today ?
On the walls of the Bodeguita from Havanna , you too can leave behind your autograph .
At the bar in the hotel Nacional , one completely as desired mixes for you of cocktail .
And the cult cars of the fifties go around in Havanna until today because the Schigulis imported once and Fiats have already fallen apart in the salty and moist air for a long time .
Havanna , particularly its oldest part descend , heavily , one finds as many wonderful colonial sights in the circumference nowhere here right .
Other places become just herausgeputzt , for example Trinidad .
There was green light in regard after that that the tourism earns immediately necessary money .
In the last fifteen years , new hotels not only resulted in Havanna but also in Varadero , at the coast of the province Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco , Cayo Guillermo and others .
Cuba offers another caprice which is unparalleled in the world and attracts above all railroad lovers .
Steam and diesel operated narrow track courses brought the sugar pipe of remote plantations to the sugar factories .
Your car fleet was not repaired over decades and like that one sees there droll and fully functioning locomotives whose age accomplices are in the museum where else most longest .
Excursion destinations
The majority of the visitors Cuba 's does not omit the meaning most ending places .
Thus one must no longer write about Varadero or Havanna in detail .
It is to be only mentioned that a museum is situated in the estate that is already mentioned Hemingways , the visit of which should be able to be escaped this author that , this , not .
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba .
The luxurious vegetation increases to lime ground .
The Mogotas , lime hill and rocks tower steeply of the valley ground , in their hollow areas , fruitful ground collected through which even rock areas that weathered are covered by dense algae growth .
It is this valley where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is cultivated .
In its final form , you can meet him if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havanna .
Possibly , it appears interesting too to some that there the Chilean consequence of the television series `` Major Zeman '' was turned .
Trinidad
.
Fame and wealth brought her of the trades with slaves and sugar .
The wealth personified in the trim beauty of the small city .
Spanish colonial architecture , strongly influences by the later French settlers , scarcely changed for four hundred years .
Trinidad , lain between the sea and the Escambray mountain range , is such a remote place that there was still no road there in the fifties of the last century which would have connected the area with the remaining country .
This insulation contributed to its having remained unbeachtet .
Nothing was constructed there but even nothing therefore torn off , each was glad that he had a roof over the head .
If one has time for Trinidad more than one afternoon , then it is worthwhile to look at interesting places in the environment as for example the beach Playa Ancón or the `` valley of the sugar factories '' .
In the evening one should then go in the Casa de la Música which comes to life following the darkness where music does not cease until the morning .
Baracoa
Some describe this small town completely in the East of Cuba as the nicest of the island .
Probably this view is influenced by the path as well there .
Both roads which lead of Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerküftete mountains and run through a countryside which is scarcely touched by human interventions .
The UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its world heir catalogue thanks to the untouched nature there .
There the best chocolate is produced , in the church , one shows the cross of Kolumbus ( it sprang up in reality hundred years approximately after one the journeys of Kolumbus ) and from the hill , where the former castle , the present hotel El Castillo , is , several board mountains are to be seen of which El Yunque is the one well-known .

However , as one like that says : Look at better with its own eyes .

A difficult souvenir

The eleven its with administration state under this entrusted Germany , France , Israel and these USA agreed in May 2006 after that to make them accessible for researchers and historians .
After the ratification process of this decision was concluded , the opening has been valid since yesterday .
Ticklish information
The access of the historians to bath Arolsen will make it possible to operate inquiries , above all over the deportations of prisoners , the passengers of the concentration warehouses and the health status the slave laborers '' , director of these archives which are managed by the international committee of the red cross ( CICR ) explains Reto to masters . ''
Up to before short ones still , several states were , under this also Germany to make these name related documents accessible for the public , on the basis of the ticklish characters of certain information .
As the alleged homosexuality or the mental handicap of some deportation sacrifices for example .
The passenger lists of the concentration warehouses or the custody commands displayed by the Gestapo had been assembled after the war from a practical reason : Civilians who deport or were subordinate to the mandatory work to find and possibly to deliver a proof means of their arrest to them in order so to level the path for them for their indemnification .
Still today , work on in bath Arolsen more than 300 permanent zehntausende of personal inquiries .
Only a limited interest in the access to bath Arolsen nevertheless , a part the scientific community shows .

Budget is through
Yes , it is managed .
The state household is endorsed .
What is what is special in this household ?
It is the first household that this government designed and that was accepted without aid the opposition by the coalition majority .
This for the current year was endorsed still with support of the CSSD ( social democrats ) because secretary Sobotka ( from this party ) had presented him and the CSSD was not therefore able to permit itself rejecting him .
In contrast with the lively debating before the co-ordination on the mistrust application against the government , nothing dramatic occurred this time .
The appoint house endorsed noted this traditionally little , nevertheless most important law calmly .
That is so to speak paradoxical .
All ruling begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household whether that pleases one or not .
.
That is a more grateful subject for the media and therefore they devote more attention to him .
.
The state households suffered at the past social democratic governments from than three weak points that the household for year 2008 can not at the same time remove :
In which case the first one it is not only concerns the high share of outputs which are obliging of law 's the pensions but also about social outputs on which the `` silent '' coalition decided of CSSD and KSCM ( Communist ) in the last year before the choices .
The second one is the deficitary budget policy as a result of the first weak point .
The third limitation exists in the deficits of public finances , i.e . the budget deficits of the local authorities .
The greatest risk is not however the state budget deficit .
This household is public and eingermaßen under control .
A true time bomb is however the budget deficit of the local authorities .
Many mayors gave in order to open up except takingses from taxes , taxes and bank credits further sources for investments , often debt orders mostly from by which they caused their city halls in the excess .
In the last years , they succeeded , with these debts by numerous sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state in the train of the denationalization in paying off .
Now this source has already dried up .
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts , we determine that :
our economy for some years as the remainder of the world , a growth phase go through , whose the CSSD is praised without Unterlass .
That represented a single possibility of their governments to take public finances into order .
Instead , these governments however involved the state @ QD even more .
Other countries , apart from a couple of exceptions as Hungarians , Albania , Pakistan or Egypt , economized a lot more rationally than our republic .
That is a giant disgrace which is to be attributed predominantly to the earlier governments .
We are among the countries which seen , in the global scale , are threatened at the least of poverty .
Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary which were unfortunately blown up right in the last years completely superfluously in giant size .
Even if it was is successful clear , a part of the absurd populistischen outputs which were discharged this year before the choices to delete that if shifting the pension entry age and a pension reform does not take place soon , then practically every policy ends up in this country and , who is in power all the same , nothing will remain for him as a pure management .
It is exaggerated only easily if one says that then who will divide the largest part of the control takingses mechanically into pensions and social outputs of reigning politicians civil servants .
Therefore the this year 's household can not be a revolution but rather can stop only the expulsion of normal outputs by duty outputs .
The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion crowns would be quite superfluous if earlier governments had not outputted in the last ten years , which only went .
If we do not want really to take place that pure administrative civil servants come from reigning politicians , then we must be patient and wish for this not all too greatest coalition government which he is is however as able to take conscious that the state can only output as much at taxes and charges , rest with the preparation of further reform laws .
Only these make possible a gradual enforcement of a balanced state household .

In the empire of Angela cloud
The reality remote appearance the chancellor documents that the coalition is in the end in substance - and that nothing is to be more expected by her .
In what country does Chancellor live this really ?
After their disconsolate appearance in the general debate of the German Federal Parliament which was wurschtig and contents poor one must say : not here - not in the country which would finally have to be ruled by her .
Angela Merkel rejected with a badly overbearing sentence the accusation that it too very concentrates on the foreign policy .
That is provincial , said it and thus showed first that it does not want to comprehend of what it is a matter for the critics .
In the German Federal Parliament , it documented recognizable for all as their accusation is very true .
Neither concrete interest was present nor to feel gar a feelings for the problems in the country .
Instead , Angela cloud presented itself : a lifted up politician who flees into the foreign policy and remains there in the approximate one herself .
Example climate protection : There it praises ungebremst for the decisions of holy dam but does not say as the climate objectives should be reached in this country .
At all , the self-praise - so much Unbescheidenheit would still have failed the CDU Chefin for itself two years ago .
Now it clings to the Floskel that the lift succeeds with the persons .
Thus it damages its image as a Pragmatikerin which solves problems instead of the world nice encourages .
.
Child poverty and the worries of the low wage-earners ?
It for that has a couple of additional sentences remaining .
Is calling as it often misspeaks when it is a matter of the child surcharge .
Merkel there needs three starts in order to bring out halfway a geraden sentence .
It stumbles as on foreign terrain if it becomes concrete .

These are not Warhols crates
The one who combines the concepts Sweden and wood crate thinks of Ikea , but not of Andy Warhol .
Or however ?
Currently manufactured wood crates throw dark shadows at Warhols plant catalogue in Sweden .
A major part of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there of the `` type Stockholm '' is forgeries .

.
Some of them achieved on auctions more than 100 000 dollar .
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén asserted later falsely that 1968 one around hundred wood crates in Sweden was produced and displayed which then left him Warhol .
.
At this time Warhol has been dead for three years .
Lars Byström , leader curator at the Moderna Museet , investigated along with the six museum own Brillo Boxes even three from Swedish private possession of which two 1968 were manufactured in Stockholm : Your pressing chipboards were primed and ground first , white oil color with a brush was served .
.

In the presence of the two men Bush that he will do everything promised , to close in order to help them , before end of the yearly 2008 a `` peace treaty '' .
In the meantime the Palestinians must destroy `` the infrastructures of terror '' and Israel must its colonizing work stop , avowed Bush , whereby it reminded the two parties of their obligations regarding the `` timetable '' for the peace , which this 2003 had agreed .
The boss of the white house stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority under Abbas of last end aim at a peace treaty , all open questions without exception , and including which was to clarify central questions `` .
This designation covers the three serious problems , around which the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians turn mainly : future borders of Palestine , which status Jerusalems and the fate of of the Arab refugees , who were driven out in the course of the conflict of 1948 from their homeland , which lies in the today 's State of Israel .

Small Saarland , good education
The smallest Land of the Federal Republic is prominent during the professional training and shines even with the international adjustment of its universities .
Only in an education field the Saarlaender presses the same deficit as the remainder of the country .
`` I have ' yesterday to 50 . Times it explains to a Nichtsaarlaender that we are not Frenchmen `` - this slogan plakatiert the smallest Land of the Federal Republic ironically to its 50 . Birthday .
France and Luxembourg play a large role in the education system of the Saarland , which is in the education formation of the institute of the German economy Cologne ( IW ) on place five .
Thus the universities cooperate already from tradition closely with the neighboring countries .
The university in Saarbruecken was created 1948 by the Frenchmen .
Until today studying can lock here their study with a double or even three-fold diploma .
The portion of foreign studying with 15,6 per cent is accordingly high .
But also the Saarland brings the national children in above average number to the universities - many of them without a conclusion at the High School .
`` in the Saarland one uses the vocational education system '' , says Axel Pluennecke , education expert with the IW .
More as each fifth young person acquires its study authorization at a vocational school , thus lies the Saarland more than seven per cent points over the Federal average .
Also the combination options of vocational and academic training are comparatively fully developed .
On the total population the equipment with binary courses of studies the secondarybest is based in Germany .
Despite the training in line with standard usage and rising demand the number of graduates of engineer sank in the past years however around a third .
Therefore the Saarland education Ministry engaged the universities now to a marketing campaign for engineer-scientific fan .
`` at the general-forming schools we activated , say some reforms according to the first Pisa study '' a spokeswoman of the education Ministry .
Thus the government introduced country-wide comparison tests .
So that the children in former times the last Kita year is to be learned to begin free of charge - a model , which in the meantime also different Lands of the Federal Republic copy .
Whether the achievements of the pupils improve lastingly will show , only future comparative studies .
With Pisa 2003 shrank the portion of the risk pupils of 29 to 20 per cent .
Altogether the Saarland did not increase however as strongly as other Lands of the Federal Republic .
Bavaria count better .
And to the annoyance of the Saarlaender Fremdsprachenkenntnise are not measured with Pisa - within this range one could score otherwise .
Because the language of the neighbours is at High Schools obligation - are even if the Saarlaender no Frenchmen .

Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland for the examination of police records , the agency does not have these information the competence outside of Great Britain to receive .

`` in the report it means that momentary placing in front tests of the NHS Scotland is well to work and it not clearly , which increase in value the recommendations will supply '' , said it .
The Scottish health authorities say that they have momentarily 1,161 foreign coworkers , the predominant majority of it physicians and nurses .
However the finance director that the number was probably higher , warned also , because the executive committees would have problems to identify those coworkers who are given time off on indefinite time .
The investigation stated further that established inspection procedures kept by NHS authorities in Ayrshire , Arran , Grampian , Greater Glasgow and Clyde , Lanarkshire , and Lothian predominantly its .
In addition passport - , work permit - belongs , and to qualification controls .
the Scottish government examines at present its politics and guidelines for controls before beginning of employment for foreign personnel in the NHS .
The secretary for health Nicola Sturgeon said : `` it was me a request this work to implement in view of the terrorist attack on the airport Glasgow . ''
It supplemented the fact that the Scottish government , in connection with the health authorities , which consider recommendations of the report and would ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines would be again-reflected concerning the control investigations in the apron of the employment of all coworkers - under it also those from the foreign country - whose publication next month are planned .

The problem is now that the legendary director of museum Pontus Hultén falsely maintained later , it 1968 approximately hundred wooden boxes in Sweden was produced and issued , which be-get it then left .

At this time were be-get already three years dead .
Lars Bystroem , chief curator at the Moderna Museet , examined three from Swedish private property beside the six museum-own Brillo Boxes also , by which two were made 1968 in Stockholm : Their laminated fiber plates were only primed and abgeschmirgelt , afterwards white oelfarbe with a brush was laid on .
The structure of the copies from the year against the fact 1990 betrays that the color with a painter role without priming was laid on directly on the laminated fiber plate - in addition it concerns not oil - , but around acryl color .
`` these crates were authorized not by the artist and should be removed from the official list from Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes '' , mention the director of the Moderna Museet , Lars Nittve , : `` if the ' Andy be-get kind Authentication board ' into New York to another conclusion does not come , the Moderna Museet the six crates in his collection than copy/exhibition material will classify .

`` I returned today , because of what I had seen on the television and which I read in the newspaper , over what happened in Bagdad , and like it would be safe now . ''
They say that the Mahdi army stopped , humans to kill `` , said it , regarding the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada when addr , arranged its forces to the current time back to place .
Qassim aluminium Atwani , a 38-jaehriger of schiitischer teachers from the predominant sunnitische part of Amariyah , returned with its both children , because he could not renew its Syrian visa and because the regime Iraqi illegally to work .
To say its schiitischen neighbours in Amariyah called it , in order it that a local , of which militia supported contributed the USA to drive aluminium-Qaida out from their bastion in the west of the capital penetrated and him to the return .
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a sunnitischen and schiitischen trunk , which had been sold from its house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with hand grenades , after it had requested its fellow citizens for fight aluminium-Qaidas .
It was returns , in order to fight .

More than two and a half million humans probably from the sektiererischen Todesschwadronen in the country fled .
`` we were well to aluminium-Maliki Syria visited and the government pushed to the Iraqis no more visas to give , around it to the return to the Iraq to force '' , said the sunnitischen pensioners .
`` I can not trust a government , the criminal ones supported , those my house down-burned , after I went away . ''
A part of the reason for the decrease of the force is that Sunniten from schiitischen populated areas were driven out in reverse and , which led to the creation of many places , where tensions diminished .
There are fears that a sudden inflow of refugees sektiererische tensions will again schueren and it to conflicts will come .

Auchan most expensively , Tesco increases by nearly a fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaoerser commercial area maintained also this yearly the average price increase of 16 % from the last year , with the difference that there was this yearly no increase of the value added tax .
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaoerser commercial triangle increased the price of the usual Weihnachtskorbes of the `` Napi '' also this yearly by 16 per cent , however in all hypermarkets price increases were registered of over 1.000 HOOF .
After the prices are `` away-galloped '' in the food markets in past December , the price increase failed prozentuell not drastically , compared with the anyway high , earlier output level .
However it affects the consumers certainly deterring that that , for which they had paid in the last year still well under 9.000 HOOF is available this yearly not even for 10.000 HOOF .
The price of the `` Napi '' of warenkorbs exceeded the magic 10.000-HUF-Grenze by at least 91 HOOF in the examined markets .
The highest price amounted to 10,573 HOOF .
( in 6800 the price was with 6.800 HOOF . )
The prices for Unicum and alive fish remained almost to previous year level , strongly rose however the prices for Putenbrustfilets , nut and poppy .
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data centers of the statistic office of Hungary , with Auchan gave it however to 1kg bread waking for 139 Forint .
There was no competition-conditioned collapse of prices on under 200 Forint with the product .
The price two litres of a Coca Cola pledge bottle of under 200 Forint was likewise surprising , thus cost here the beverage inclusive pledge only 257 HOOF .
This yearly in the `` Napi '' nevertheless cut most expensively , and Cora to goods basket comparison off Auchan most favorably .
Our computations resulted in that Cora the prices in the `` Napi '' warenkorb opposite the Weihnachtspreisen in the past year around 15 , while Tesco and Auchan increased in each case by 18 per cent .
The difference between the cheapest warenkorb of the previous year and the most expensive heurigen yearly amounted to 12 % , while the increase between cheapest warenkorb of the past most yearly one and most expensive of the current yearly constituted 21 % .
The average price rise amounted to 1,480.00 HOOF .
The average price increase still was in the previous year about 1.206,00 Forint , however the value added tax increase became apparent with the prices to last Christmas .
Exactly this procedure met the trade badly : Apparent the department stores could not decide so quite , which price margin them with the individual articles to use to be supposed , since the effects of the price increase were unpredictable on the consumer behaviour .
( if the dealer the peripheral speed of a product badly plans , can he around substantial profits fall in the price margin , according to the traffic intensity arranges themselves . )
Mehwertsteuer caused the price increase of the `` Napi '' of warenkorbes failed in the past year in such a manner radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint , whereas the difference in prices amounted to with the cheapest basket only 844 Forint .
This yearly such extremes were not observed , since the most expensive basket cost more around 1.630,00 Forint , as in the previous year , and even with the cheapest there was a price rise of 1.284,00 Forint .
In the comparison of the two last Weihnachtssaisons a catastrophic price increase , the price of the daily consumer items showed up in the hypermarkets in as 20 months around more than 30 per cent less rose .
( this again does not confirm necessarily the data centers of the statistic office of Hungary : With some basic food the statistic office in the period of 12 months determined one more than 30-prozentige price increase .
So in for instance beside flour also with eggs . )
If one throws however a view into the `` Napi '' to warenkorb , this seems almost impossible with the latter , since the price level of the already in the previous year expensive product rose even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent .
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position , than the Eilieferanten - nevertheless they could shift the drastic price increase upon the multis .
In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not deplore themselves ; It is reported constantly by good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look no more on the prices .
From all large quantities are bought , durable food go into pallets over the counters .
Wednesday morning gave it in all three department stores endless queues with the cash , when suddenly the number of the customers exploded .
However by the country a smaller customer frequency is reported , so that many multis deplore themselves with the public opinion analysts , it could not even the planned conversion achieve , not only with food , but also with lasting consumer goods .

In the realm of Angela cloud
_ the out of touch with reality appearance the Kanzlerin document , that the coalition contentwise to end be - and that of it nothing more expect be .
In which country does this Bundeskanzlerin actually live ?
After its hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag , which was wurschtig and contents-poor , one must say : not here - not in the country , which would have to be finally governed by it .
Angela Merkel with a badly practice-substantial sentence rejected the reproach that she concentrates too much on the foreign policy .
That is provinziell , said it and showed with the fact only that she does not want to understand , for which the critics are .
In the Bundestag it documented for all recognizably , how very their reproach applies .
There neither concrete interest nor a feeling were to feel for the problems in the country .
Instead Angela presented itself cloud : a politician taken off , who flees into the foreign policy and remains even there in the approximate one .
Example climatic protection : There it praises itself without brakes for the resolutions of holy dam , says however not , how the in this country climatic goals are to be achieved .
At all , the self praise - so much immodesty would have malfunctioned itself the CDU boss still before two years .
Now it clasps itself to the empty phrase that the upswing arrives with humans .
Thus it damages its image as Pragmatikerin , which solves problems , instead of beautiful-talking the world .
But in the realm of Angela cloud problems relating to domestic affairs are an edge feature .
Child poverty and the concerns of the low breadwinners ?
A few subordinate clauses has it for it remaining .
It is characteristic how often she promises herself , when it concerns the allowance for children .
Merkel needs three approaches there , in order to bring a halfway straight sentence out .
It stolpert as on strange terrain , if it becomes concrete .

The climate on the Venus could show a view on the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to the life , said scientists yesterday .
Data of a European spaceship present at an orbit show the fact that the planet resembles a turned away twin of the earth still more than so far was conscious .
The Venus is the naeheste planetary neighbour of the earth .
The two worlds possess approximately the same size and have similar planet courses , however the Venus of the sun is somewhat closer .
Before billions of years on the Venus conditions would have prevailed , which would have been very similar to those on earth and even habitably , believed scientist could have been today .
But because of the carbon dioxide greenhouse effect without brakes , the erosion of the atmosphere by sun exposure and a slower rotation speed the Venus hit completely different development course .
Today the planet of water is robbed and has a surface temperature , which is hot enough , lead to melt and by hurricane-strong hoists and lightning towers is devastated .
The realizations of the space probe Venus express of the European space travel agency , which planned for one year examined , offer a ernuechternden view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climatic changes .
Professor Fred Taylor of the department of physics at the University of Oxford , one the director/conductor of the Venus express mission , said : `` it becomes clear , why the climate on the Venus to that earth is so different , while the planets are rather similar otherwise . ''
`` our new data make it possible to design a scenario in which the Venus before billions of years began like the earth , possibly with a habitable environment . ''

The capital Sofia offers likewise enticing offers - handels and office surfaces offer highest net yields .
Bulgaria is to be become on the best way one the most attractive European Golferparadiese to thus attract and apart from the summer and winter season also in the two other seasons tourists .
Foresighted investors buy therefore already now on a large scale , for example approximately around Bansko .
According to analysts humans , who acquire real estates , strive also a change of their life change in Bulgaria on .
In addition , most buyers are Englishman , it come prospective customers from France , Belgium , Spain , and ever more from Romania .
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are likewise present , while there are predominantly Russian buyers with the black sea and in the skiing areas .
There are three groups of foreign buyers , say Georgij Jankov , director of regional von Re/Max Bulgaria .
Those , which want to establish themselves , buy either revitalisierte real estates around 50-100.000 euro , or heruntergekommene houses around 5-15.000 euro , which recondition them then .
Good binding and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are largely written , in addition , the proximity to a large city , business and physicians are crucial for the buyers .
To the second category belong those , which are on the search to a holidays domicile ( Bulgaria was listed in December under the Top Ten vacation goals of the Germans ) .
Businessmen constitute the third group , who invest with the goal of a central to long-term increase in value .
Real estates in the capital meanwhile constantly more expensively , due to the always growing demand .
Within the European Union the real estate prices are in Bulgaria at the lowest , in the past five years gave it however a price increase around annually 21 per cent .
The price increase with the real estate prices exceeds by far the rise of the salaries .

`` we must make certain that not also with us social explosive develops itself and unloads in force .
We must take that seriously `` , said he '' to the new press appearing in Hanover `` .
Not each young humans get along with the fast change of the social reality .
Federation , countries and municipalities worked already with reproduction to diminish problems said Schaeuble .
References not only the integration of Migranten .
`` from the integration summit to the conference of Islam that shows already first successes . ''
For 'all-clear ' signal it is however too early .
Schaeuble pointed out at the same time that it does not give problems concerning town construction and sociological in German suburbs as in France .
In northern suburbs of Paris young people had supplied themselves heavy road battles with the police in the past nights .
Also in Toulouse cars and public buildings burned .
Meanwhile the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany , Kenan Kolat demanded larger integration efforts of the Federal Government .
In view of the riots in France Kolat before `` imitation effects '' warned .
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France .
There is action need however nevertheless .
Kolat referred to the fact that the unemployment ratio was `` above average high '' with young people with migration background under 25 years .

Climatic propaganda
Since the climatic debate submits of a merciless criticism both the Skeptiker of the climatic change as well as those , which place in this connection a social and political debate into the foreground , the movement as a whole strong co-operation must put to the day .
Above all if it concerns a leader of the movement , that , as in the case of the head of the provincial government Zapatero , the fight against the climatic change considers more important than the fight of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests locking a `` new contract with the planet '' .
This suggestion brings it however in explanation emergency concerning acting , and/or non -- action of its government , which contributed crucially to the fact that Spain stands within the European Union at the point of the countries , which fulfilled the defaults of Kioto minutes to few .
Who are the responsible persons for the default of the defaults , on which sectors this is to lead back , and why has his government , that had suggested the `` contract with the planet '' , this development not stopped .
In addition it is now forced to state to the Spanish citizens planned by it the measures against the climatic change without .
Which companies will be affected by which is to be changed behavior of the citizens , who individual and collective economy measures must be accomplished and which economic consequences result from it .
More exactly said , who must sacrifice itself and for the rescue of the planet will pay .
However it does not have and it in the future such explanations will give .
Straight because it concerns itself the Aufopfern and paying .
Because the measures , which can be material used against the climatic change , are unpopular .
They are cost-rich , uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of the companies and citizens .
Even the gasoline cent suggested by the PSOE appeared Zapatero choice-strategically seen so dangerously that it saw itself forced to take the suggestion back again .
Accordingly it applies now , for the planet with nothing to thus save with pure propaganda and empty sayings without each material consequences .
With impressive statements , commissions , committees , minutes and new offices .
With his contracts with the planet must talk otherwise for election campaigns so suitable politicians neither , nor accuse , nor demand , instead however to the fastidious expenditure to follow to decorate and with its sanftmut and quality other one inspire the meetings .
This can happen however only if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and so also it does not give that the bicycle will be allowed itself in the future to the only progressive movement means or we only with a fan erfrischen .

The choice of the status Quo
On Sunday it will not become exciting during the counting of the urns : The mass of the Russians will decide for president PUT in a party , united Russia .
After a very much blocked election campaign it confirms its striving for stability , even after Autoritarismus .
Russian president Vladimir Putin a message radiated on the public transmitters addresses three days before the parliamentary elections to the voters , who were noted of course , whose contents are however kept secret .
He does this in his characteristic as a leading candidate of united Russia , who a pro Kremlin party , for which an overwhelming victory announces itself .
Yesterday the president let nothing see through , when he received the foreign Ambassadors , and was satisfied to supply a new point of attack against the Western powers those the interference accused of its favourite topic during the election campaign .
`` we know the price of a trueful democracy and expect honest elections , extremely transparent and openly , elections without frauds '' , added it .
From view of the opposition they have itself there vertan .
It prangert one by suppression stained election campaign .
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says , it would have never given , not even `` such dirty elections in the time of Eltsin '' .
After the suppression of the demonstrations on the last weekend , Garry Kasparovder applies to bad demonstrating to five days detention condemned was , according to its lawyer further for attendance prohibition to ex chess world champions .
`` the Russians retained themselves the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus ''
After these parliamentary elections without tension two many resuming questions raise themselves :
- who will begin PUT in follow-up as a president ?
The office newspaper communicated the date of the first ballot of the presidency elections yesterday , 2 March 2008 ; the candidates have time until 23 December to make itself well-known .
Since he was selected 2000 and 2004 were red-elect , Vladimir Putin can not begin for a third mandate in consequence .
And now is no successor .
Which role will play Putin after March ?
Prime minister ?
Chairman of the majority in parliament and the all-powerful party united Russia , the government and president will select ?
Whatever it will be , at the parliament or with the presidency elections , which become past power triumphieren .
That is tradition .
`` the Russians retained themselves the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus , are not them not master of their fate '' , mean the sociologist Lev Goudkov , director of the independent center Levada .
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the national university sank Petersburg continues to decrease even still : The civil society developed itself further in this country , which was christianisiert five centuries to Europe , only very slowly ; the famous community spirit retarded the development of individuality .
After the liberals Putin tied reforms of the 90 's again to the model of a paternalistischen state , which was accepted perfectly by the population , the more , since after this new Paternalismus no terror followed , but a certain economic prosperity , Maria Lipman of the Carnegie donation means .
Today the Russians `` do '' `` from free pieces without the personal responsibility '' , which they put after the decay of the USSR briefly to the day .
`` consider to which still for a long time ? ''
This phenomenon concerns all social classes , including the commercial world .
And the administrative elite understands it to hold the status Quo : 65 governors ( of 85 Russian region chairmen ) state the local lists of candidates of united Russia .
The new liberties coming from the west are often equivalent to chaos , as in the 90 's .
The public prefers stability .
In this sense the Russians will also not be correct for the extremistic parties .
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko , a 54-jaehrigen Professorin : `` consider to which still for a long time ?
Those , which are in power , are not so bad , why they replace ? ''

The Spanish private station Telecinco doubles for the first time its stock exchange value and overhauls thus its rival Antena 3 .
`` we created it . ''
With this sentence the managing director of Telecinco , with stock exchange conclusion gave his satisfaction to Paolo Vasile kund . The transmitter led by it had increased its value by double its rival the Antena 3 .
An aspect however absorbed its joy : `` that is exactly which me is hurt ; not that we a higher growth , but that we had smaller losses `` , determined it .
It stressed that they did not sink despite the weak market `` too deeply . ''
Telecinco terminated yesterday the day with a plus of 2,54 % .
This profit reduces its past losses of this year on 15,66 % .
According to data of Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euro now , whereby Mediaset controls the principal part of the capital ( 52 % ) , and Vocento only with 13 % is involved .
The rival Antena 3 lost yesterday 1.52 per cent points and has since January a loss of altogether 40.5 % to announce , so that its market value with 2,193.46 million amounts to half .
The market value of other quoted communication enterprises however rises ; in the case of Sogecable on 3,571 million , with Prisa ( publisher of the magazine Cinco Días ) on 2,518.53 million and with Vocento on 1,779 million .
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it concerns `` two similar enterprises '' , so Vasile .
Still the question , in which we can act to extent actually stock exchange-technically , appears uncertain to which price and as we it on customer level to be arranged lucrative can .
Telecinco explained one week ago its project to ascend this year to the first television station with more than 1000 million gross profits from incomes from advertising . This insured Guiseppe Tringali , the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña , the advertising enterprise of the group .
If the project should be converted , the transmitter would increase its advertising income compared with the 965.4 million from the previous year by 3,6 % .
In the case of Antena 3 the net turnover rose around 1,6 % in the first nine stock exchange months ( up to 734.4 million ) , while the net income from the television business could exhibit only a rise of 0,7 % ( 630.4 million ) .
The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange process of Telecinco , better in the comparison , with the high Payout Ratio , which the company could exhibit up to the current time : 2006 arranged the enterprise a 100 percent declaration of dividend led by Alejandro Echevarría .
Vasile insures however that the Ratio could vary after the purchase of 33 % of the portions of end mol , with Mediaset as parent company , nor , even if it is still too early for an official publication .
`` we are committed to the official compromise to disburse at least 50 % of the portions even if we indicated so far always substantially more .
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year , whose stocks we could already increase by the purchase of 33 % of the end mol portions .
According to statement of the analysts the market to time exhibits certain loss tendencies .
Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently its profit calculation with Telecinco for this year by 4 % and for 2009 by 7 % .
This is the result of shortening the prospective growth rate , which will decrease/go back 2008 of 10,5 % to 8,4 % and 2009 of 5,5 % to 5,1 % .
This lowered also the prospective calculation of profits of Antena 3 for 2008 around 4,5 % and for 2009 around 7,5 % .
3 options .
1 .
Ibersecurities : sets on his high effective return and his lasting potential and recommends therefore the purchase of both shares .
2 .
Caja Madrid : Telecinco ( buy ) attaches due to the `` multiple incentives '' and the prosperierenden market a more favourable position than Antena to 3 ( hold ) .
3 .
JPMorgan : recommends to put expectations back in both cases in view of the `` similar threats '' ( satisfied market and worse restaurant climate )

The Spice Girls gave volume to that in the Canadian Vancouver before the eyes of 20.000 spectators the starting signal for their first route after the dissolution in the year 2000 .
' Posh Spice ' ( Victoria Beckham ) , ' Scary Spice ' ( Melanie Brown ) , ' baby Spice ' ( Emma Bunton ) , ' Sporty Spice ' ( Melanie Chisholm ) y ' Ginger Spice ' ( Geri Halliwell ) explained briefly before beginning of their concert in the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that those was `` outstanding '' the tendency in the reunited volume .
Around 20,000 humans could the concert in the sold off stadium see , with which a video had provided to history that volume , the end of the nineties for sensation , one showed .
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the publication of a new album , which contains its largest hits and two further new Songs , `` Headlines '' and `` Voodoo '' , and which appear in Spain under the label of EMI .
The five members of the Spice Girls carried golden armlets , which them the married man of `` Posh Spice '' on the stage , which had given English soccer players David Beckham , before .
The sportsman was under the fan masses in the public , which brought GM the Palace to the glowing , although the nerves of its marriage wife Victoria had forbidden it to it in the preceding days .

Everything still openly
Memo Romey said , it did not keep it worthy a presidency candidate by a schneemann to be asked .
Nevertheless the republican explained itself candidate for the presidency in the long run ready to place itself to a debate on YouTube in which normal voters questions on video accepts and submits , in order it the candidate to send .
None questions , which were at the Wednesday evening , which 28 November , were raised , as ridiculously as the schneemann , which asked democrats over the global heating up in the YouTube debate of the other party .
But the questions , and the answers , reflected this mark exactly the condition of the republican party , which breaks open into the elections in the next year .
It is not well-known , exactly like the producers of CNN , which every now and then-supported the debate , which to YouTube showing tie-clips selected the beginning candidate .
However in the first half hour of the debate , which was dedicated longest to an individual topic , immigration stood in the center .
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for republicans .
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters a dial to serve , if they heard things , which pleased them : The TV organization noticed points of the agreement as the candidates strictly about the borders spoke .
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani , the national outrider , and Romney , which pushed themselves forward in the crucial inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire .
Giuliani tries to shake the call off , it regarding illegal immigration was flexible , when he was a mayor of New York .
It attacked Romney in which it the former governor von Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for work on its house to have adjusted .
The two argued particularly violently as interrogators asked whether one of the candidates would support a `` amnesty '' ( would give the illegal ones a regular status and the possibility on the nationality ) .
Unbedeutendere candidate such as Duncan Hunter , a California congressional representative , and Tom Tancredo , a congressional representative from Colorado , succeeded to after-hook it with this topic .
None of the two men has serious chances with nominating , but both remain in running , perhaps because they gehauen in former times and harder as others on the immigration bass drum have .
At least within the range of the immigration the candidates divide on the whole the same opinions : sharper borders , intolerance opposite illegal Migranten .
This topic , together with fears over poisonous toy from China or other concerns over the remainder of the world , helps to forget the republicans the differences between liberals and Christian conservative ones or minimize .
But the debate was brought clearly problematic as other topics to the language .
Mr. Giuliani was asked , why he had supported weapon restrictions in the past .
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be regarded as torture .
One the interrogator asked whether the candidates believed each word of the Bible .
This led to the fact that Giuliani held the point of view that although the Bible was its preferential book he the history of Jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale .
A further interrogator asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations at the first place in a recently accomplished inquiry in Iowa owing to its Christian conservativism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty was necessary painfully , but .
When it was pushed on it whether Jesus would endorse it , he laughed over and said Jesus was too intelligently for itself for a political office to be applied .
Running remains unusually far open .
Huckabees ascent in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls recent donation successes and its applause storms in the debate of Wednesday .
These two are not high-shot from that anything , because the two wings of the party could not agree so far yet on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates .
In the year 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the outset and convincingly united with a victorious message over the size of America and a Zwinkern to both wings of the party .
This mark is split the party and the result is by far not clear .

After parents of pupils had weighted several times at the Sudanese ministry for education and cultural , the 54-jaehrige basic lady teacher , who was active to the Unity High School of Khartum , was at home taken up on Sunday with itself and accused of according to the article 125 of the Sudanese penal code of the offense of the Islam .
This affair actually takes its beginning in September , when the teacher requests her six to seven-year-old pupil to select a name for the class teddy .
`` the children suggest to Hassan , Abdullah and Mohammed '' eight names , among them , report head master Robert Boules .
Finally , when the class co-ordinates , 20 from 23 children Mohammed select as dearest first names .
Surely , Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet , but above all also a first name very frequent in the Sudan .
Subsequently , the children provided a book for the class , with the photo of the bear on it and to the caption `` my name are Mohammed '' .
The bear did not carry a sign with this name , but the problem is completely simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as offense of the Islam .
One of the moslemischen colleagues of Gillian Gibbons , which informs at the same school in the Sudan , explained , he knew her well , and she would have never something would have done , with which she could step too close to a religious faith , `` I regrets that she asked the children , for a name to only be correct '' , its judgement concerns it here only a `` innocent error '' .
An opinion , which numerous pupils of the teacher divide , the this as `` very attentively opposite their pupils '' and as a `` person , who never speaks in the class about religion '' describes .
One considers that the first name Mohammed is simultaneous also the secondary name given in Great Britain at the secondly most frequent , for which in English 14 different ways of writing exists .
This of moslemischen families selected first name is often considered as a kind Ehrerbietung at the prophets ( it is given frequently to the Erstgeborenen of a family ) .
But how the rules in the reference to the use of this first name read ?
May one give it for example to a toy ?
This is naturally a question of the interpretation .

In many places at disinfectants one saves
This year more than thousand infections in hospitals were registered , which were to due to inappropriate handling antibiotics .
The hygenic conditions in the hospitals , the overflow of the beds , the overload of the personnel - all factors , which are not detrimental to damming the infections straight , so the leading lady doctor of the national epidemiology center .
In many places also with the disinfectants one saves .
In the Traumatologie department of the János of hospital recently an MRSA infection was diagnosed .
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient , who was in-supplied after a heavy accident to the hospital .
The patient was isolated .
At the beginning of the yearly there was here already a similar infection .
The hurt one of a heavy car accident became from the hospital to dismiss , a little later had the man however with an MRSA infection to return . An important operation could not be accomplished since then because of the bacterium , which is still in the body of the patient , yet .
Until 10 December of this yearly from hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant exciters released infections were announced to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system , so the leading lady doctor of the national epidemiology center , Karolina Boeroecz .
So many infections released by multi-resistant exciters were thus registered in the hospitals with security , the dark number might be however higher .
About two thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) were released by the MRSA , that against Methicillin Oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
The Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) bacterium carries for instance a third of humans in its nose , without it would cause an illness .
SA-CONDITIONED infections ( as for instance neck inflammation , almond inflammation , inflammations of the skin or wounds ) react usually well to antibiotics , it are well welfarable .
If the means are however too highly proportioned or used inappropriately , antibiotic-resistant from that well respondierenden bacteria , which spread under appropriate conditions in the hospitals fast , develop .
In particular with patients with weakened , or durably badly functioning immune system , in addition , in older , or patients with small body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections , as for instance for Wundinfektion or blood poisoning , thus Sepsis .
The medical director/conductor of the János of hospital according to the MRSA infection is nothing special , such incidents belongs to the patient house everyday life .
One may not confound the infection with the epidemic disease , manhte Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA gives it only not , where she is not looked for .
Resistant to antibiotics
`` such patients are isolated , the maintenance personnel carry rubber gloves and masks with the supply , and we have Tibor Nyulasi the antibiotics '' necessary for the treatment - in such a way .
Examined during their admission in the hospital will the patients on MRSA , an infection can not be nevertheless always avoided .
Samplings too rarely
The majority of the infections in hospitals , released by MRSA , would be avoidable , however the at present dominant conditions and circumstances were unfavorable for the containment of the emergence or the propagation of the multi-resistant exciter , say Karolina Boeroecz .
After this infection predominantly occurs in hospitals and old people 's homes , the hospitals should examine the in-supplied patients and MRSA infected to isolate immediately .
In the Hungarian hospitals the micro-biological sampling however so frequently one does not practice .
Not least because there are of sides of the national health insurance company no subsidies for this investigation .
Most cases would come therefore only then to the daylight , if the patient has already a noticeable MRSA infection , so the medical chief of the epidemiology center .
In addition , Vonseiten of the European union gives it strict recommendations regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humanmedizin , it gives in Hungary to guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and disease pictures .
Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful , i.e. , micro-biological investigations are necessary , so that no resistance can form against the means , however this directive by hospitals are also not always kept .
Under the ambulatory , or itself in the basic supply patient present is micro-biological samplings even still more rarely , like that Karolina Boeroecz .
One saves with the disinfectants
Scientific proofs prove that MRSA will transfer from a patient to the other one most frequently from the maintenance personnel .
Straight one therefore comes to the hand washing , or carrying gloves and masks a great importance , however there are substantial lack in the hospitals also in this area .
MRSA will transfer the infected patient by droplet infection or contact , in the domestic hospitals does not exist however always the possibility , to isolate .
The rooms are even often overcrowded , those beds scarcely together gereiht , although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological view .
How Karolina Boeroecz continues to mark , it seems unfortunately in financially less the hospitals well placed even that with disinfectants is saved , it gives few male nurses , many patients - all to factors , which almost favour the emergence of infections .
Such infections are there as can be prove far less frequent , and/or can be stopped the further spreading of the exciter , where these preventive measures are kept , so Karolina Boeroecz .
Government program against MRSA
MRSA infections into the grasp to gotten causes for the health insurances enormous costs , therefore they are everywhere fought .
In England for example the vorbeugung by MRSA , and/or its containment was held in the government program .
After first signs the program is successful - like published data occupy , is declining the tendency of the MRSA infections in England .
The European center for disease prevention ( ECDC ) the vorbeugung of the emergence of multi-resistant exciters ( under it also MRSA ) , as well as the vorbeugung of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities explained .

Gallup locates cabinet crisis
After long stagnating the number of the Fidesz sympathizers to at the beginning of of Decembers grew substantially . Erstmal since 2002 has the party the largest basis camp , while the agreement for the socialists achieved a tiefpunkt of 13 per cent , dagewesenen ever , according to Gallup .
With the party-faithful voters the difference precipitates clearly owing to the high determination of the opposition proponents : More than two thirds ( 71 per cent ) face fifth ( 20 per cent ) agreement for the MSZP .
MDF and SZDSZ are according to inquiry under the parliamentary entrance hurdle : They come in the total population on two per cent .
The number of party voters grew in both bearings by a per cent .
In the comparison to the last tiefpunkt the general economic tendency continued to worsen - the portion of those , which judge the economic situation of the country as `` expressed badly '' , was so high never before ( 41 per cent ) , while they regard further 46 per cent `` rather bad '' as .
After hope-fuller prospects in the spring and summer the families see the change of their financial situation again more pessimistic .
For the coming year the majority of the population counts on a further degradation of the situation ; only one tenth proceeds from an improvement .
In December an accomplished Gallup inquiry resulted in the fact that 71 % of the asked ones - a historical high - which as `` rather badly as quite '' judged work of the prime minister .
Thirteen per cent of the asked ones have large confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány , while the portion of the proponents for Viktor Orbán constitutes 38 per cent .
Approximately 54 % do not trust the head of the government at all , compared with 27 % distrust against the party chief of the Fidesz .
One of the indicators of the political tendency is the number of those , means , one could get the discontent with the Prime Minister also without changes of government into the grasp .
After unrests in past October still if 35 % for the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government had expressed themselves , this portion amounts today to only 20 % , while the relative majority ( 33 per cent ) sees the solution only in new elections .
For their interest in the popular vote it answered asked 60 per cent that they participate `` with security '' would deliver , and further 20 % their vote `` probably '' .
To the comparison : if the parliamentary elections would take place on this Sunday , only 55 per cent `` with security '' to the urns would go , further 15 % regard its participation as `` probably '' . In view of these tendencies the result of the popular vote would be foreseeable .
74 % would be correct against the study fees , 79 % against the practice fee , and 84 % against the hospital day money .
Put down on the group at the popular vote `` with security '' participation became the portions of the opponents of the studies - , practice and hospital fees even of the 81 , 84 , and/or . 89 per cent amount to .

Which insurance is suitable for me best ?
The KFZ insurance , which takes one off of the driver caused possible case of loss , contains a high cost , whose height depends wiederrum on different factors , among other things from age , sex , time of the production of the driving licence , family status , kind of the car which can be insured and its use , etc..
A car to possess is only the beginning .
Because even more with difficulty the suitable KFZ insurance is to be found than the correct vehicle model .
First of all it must be clear one with which we have to do it here .
An autoinsurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurant .
This agreement is held in writing by means of an insurance contract , which specifies the fact that the society receives the agreed upon insurance premium and is in response obligated to submit with a case of loss the appropriate sum paid in compensation .
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance , for which by several factors builds itself up , among other things . Older , sex , time of the production of the driving licence , family status , kind of the vehicle which can be insured or its use .
The insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics , so that with a higher danger of accident also higher payments of dues become due .
For this reason both over 25-year old and women fewer payments of dues carry out , because statistics must prove that these groups exhibit a smaller accident rate owing to their caution .
The same applies also to married persons , there these according to statement of the statistic values and therefore also after conviction of the enterprises , to fewer accidents bends like unmarried ones .
The use , which is attached to the vehicle , impairs the frequency of driving and concomitantly the probability of an accident .
The more frequently the use , the more probably the damage .
With the list of the premium the insurance must consider a whole set of points .
For this reason also the driver must study the situation thoroughly , in order to select exactly the autoinsurance , which comes to meet its personal needs earliest .
We do not only list the most important points , which one should consider with the selection of an insurance here now , in order one achievement - , to be able to meet but also an price-oriented choice .
Under 25-year old meet with the choice of a low-priced insurance numerous obstacles , e.g . the small driving experience and the `` young '' driving licence .
Even if it were best for an ideal insurance protection to lock an insurance against all risks there are nevertheless more inexpensive alternatives .
The careful drivers can select insurance against all risks with self participation , so that the achievements of an insurance against all risks are covered , but offered for a low price .
This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount resulted from the damage .
`` the amount is specified before conclusion of the contract and on the basis the height of the insurance premium . This is more highly the smaller the sum which can be paid `` , explains Luis Noguera , general agent of Spain with roofridge Europe , a switching enterprise for on-line insurance .
Another option is the extended insurance , which insures the customer against external accident damages , not however against the damages developed at the own car .
In addition this kind of the insurance would cover theft , fire and vehicle loss .
Here an advice .
If you are old under 25 years , it lies in your hand to lower the cost of insurance ; thus your credit note increases , by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents .
A credit note is a lowering of the basis tariff with the appropriate insurance company .
In the opposite in addition contain a punishing payment a rise of mentioned tariff .
`` the height of credit notes and punishing payments depend their yields on the society and .
If the enterprise has a yield-rich year behind itself , it can take the liberty to increase the bonus payments `` , describes Noguera .
As soon as the 25-Jahre-Marke is exceeded , it is to be locked for the drivers more simply a contract . Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving experience the accident rate sinks .
Thus it is most meaningful to decide for an insurance against all risks with self participation .
`` normally the young people can draw no use from their past experience , both in the case of an accident and at the time of driving not '' , describe the Spanish chiefs of the European enterprise , and add that the majority of the accidents in the second practice practice occur , after the `` fear of the beginner '' was put down .
It is more advisable nevertheless at a married customer , who does not possess children , to lock an insurance against all risks ; naturally then only if it also permits the financial situation of the appropriate person .
On the part of the insurers married couples with children apply as the customers with the smallest accident rate , and accordingly low also its payments of dues fail .
In this case an insurance against all risks with self participation ( with an amount around the 300 euro ) would be the best option . In the case that one received a high credit note , is recommended an extended insurance , which begins only to the third vehicle year .
`` you drive altogether more relaxed and possess a larger purchasing power , which permits it to them , a higher payment of dues to set '' , determine Luis Noguera .
For pensioners it offers itself , an insurance against all risks with self participation ( with an amount around the 150 euro ) , to lock or an extended insurance which begins only with a sufficiently high credit note .
Finally one must note that the autoinsurance is somewhat very important , not only , because she protects the driver from possible accident damages , but also , because she saves high costs , which require it that a thorough selection is met , which corresponds to our personal situation .

Does the credit crisis stick on America credit card market ?
If blood is in the water , is it is only natural that dorsal fins whirl excited .
Now where of Americas is ailing property market , the raubtiere have the credit card market of the country in the visor .
Analysts of Goldman Sachs count on the fact that the credit card losses could 99 billion dollar reach , if the infection danger of under-financed credits spreads on other forms of using credits .
Signs of the strain are clearly visible .
There are rises both with the writing off and with the default rates , which measure the portion of the credits , which are too late not in each case retractably or more as 30 days .
The HSBC announced in the last month that she took 1.4 billion dollar collection of charges from their American consumer financings , partly because of the weakness of credit card takers .
It is nevertheless too early , in order to purge in panic .
Losses and defaults are still low .
According to the Ratingagentur Moody almost was the third quarter default rate of 3.89 % a full per cent point below the historical average .
The degradation with the rates can be explained partially by technical factors .
A change in the American private insolvency law laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of declarations of bankruptcy , which constitute again for a large part of the Keditkartenverluste ; the number of registrations ( and thus default fees ) again it would rise whether the general conditions for applicants for the credit worsen or not .
The industry reports also of solid payment rates , which show , how much of their debts the consumers pay to each month off
and the confidence into credit card-based securities is rather strong , despite the stop in other corners of the structured financing .
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup , a research enterprise , counts on the fact that the expenditure quantities will be higher for 2007 in the long run 25 % than last year .
There are surely direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market : it is more probable that consumers take up credit card debts , now that home of one 's own credits drain .
The map exhibitors look however on the cash flow instead of on present values , therefore falling house prices release not necessarily a change in the credit-worthiness of the applicant for the credit .
They can be of advantage even for the map exhibitors .
The incentives for consumers for paying the raterate rates further sink , if the real estates are less value than the value of the loan ; as result the map debts under the repayment priorities become more important .
Map exhibitors can react also many faster and more flexibly than credit givers to the stormier conditions , by changing interest rates or credit borders .
That should reduce theoretically the risk of a fast re-valuation of net assets .
`` we will wake up not a daily and the loans evaluate completely again '' , say Gary Perlin , Capital Ones main financial adviser .
Even if a sudden understocking crisis is improbable in the credit card market , the risks of a lasting wing over are substantially material .
If lower house prices and a credit reduction America will certainly stand into the recession urge , the industry before a grimmigeren future .
Hold they for far look out for these shark fish fins .

New fears over natural gas controversy between Russia and the Ukraine
A new price controversy smolders between the Ukraine and Russia , which increases the danger that Russian exports from fuel are impaired to Western Europe .
The largest part of the Russian natural gas exports into the European union ( European Union ) is led by the Ukraine and each controversy between the two nations is observed very exactly .
Kiew has before it warned that if Moscow increases the price , which it must pay for the natural gas , it from Russia higher transit charges in calculation will place .
An earlier conflict between the two states in the last year reduced supplies into the European Union states .
The recent controversy between Kiew and Moscow happened at a time , to that the Ukrainian government and the Russian , national gas monopoly Gazprom try to reach an agreement by means of how much must pay the Ukraine for Russian natural gas in the year 2008 .
According to Gazprom the Ukraine must be computed more , there the company agreed up to 50 % additionally for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan to pay .
Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine must pay 40 % more for the imports of Gazprom .
`` it is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states with discussions '' , said the minister of economics of the Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the press agency Reuters .
`` the changing natural gas prices should certainly be connected with our arguments concerning the height of the transit charges [ to Western Europe ] by the Ukraine . ''
In the last large natural gas controversy between Moscow and Kiew in January 2006 Gazprom shortened supplies into the Ukraine .
This led in consequence to a case of the exports to Western Europe , which drove the prices drastically up .
Russian gas constitutes a quarter of the supply of the European union .
Russia has the world-wide largest gas occurrences , but remains underdeveloped of it much .
The consequence is that Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other centralasiatic former Soviet nations .

Is Endjahres aRally approaching for the stock exchange ? Disagreement with the experts due to the US US crisiscUs crisis
With scarcely five weeks up to the end-of-year procedure at the stock exchange the investors already rub regarding the coming Endjahres Rally the hands .
Nevertheless the experts can provide in this connection no safe prognoses .
Banif believes that `` purely statistically regards , the month Decembers at the stock exchange normally with a positive market tendency accompanies
Nothing the defiance is not advisable it to provide prognoses at short notice and only on the basis from statistics to . Above all not if tensions which can be taken seriously determine the current market happening
Although other experts do not approve such an strong improvement in prices in the last weeks of the yearly , these mark nevertheless that `` the market prices of given the liquidity of the market and the market participant is determined . These invest due to the lack of safe share funds mainly in pension fund , which is strongly concerned by the revaluation-running trend to productive net assets .
Therefore according to opinion of these experts the stock exchange rather a rather lateral , from market fluctuations affected course trend to exhibit , `` above all because we yet the extents of the possible decrease of the interest rate of the US issuing bank to measure be able , an uncertainty particularly to the risen crude oil price and the danger of the rise of the inflation rate due is not . ''
Javier Barrio , chairman of the sales department with.bpi in Spain , agrees with the fact that it is a daring time to announce a forthcoming market Rally .
`` the chances stand not very well '' , insure the expert .
The Spanish share index Ibex already lost a value of 4 % since its maximum mark on 8 November of 15.945,7 points .
But all experts do not divide the same negative opinion .
In the opinion of Juan Solana , analyst with Intermoney , could lock the Ibex 35 due to the restructuring of the unit trust fund and the traditional , each year at this time made Bezuschussung of the pension scheme , the year successfully with nearly 16,000 points .
The expert emphasizes nevertheless that this year the things somewhat differently develop could ; particularly due to already in the second December week , and therefore directly after the bridge day for the day of the condition , taking place Endjahres Rally .
In opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations would not affect the markttendenzen .
According to estimate of Federico Olucha , analyst with the bank Inversis , find the past evaluations to the market situation on an almost technical level , which could lead to it , `` that shortly a deviation from the index values appear could , their extents depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis .
The analyst trusts in the fact that these positively fail .
With the selection of the values , which are to advance the Ibex to new maxima , are itself the analysts united .
Solana of Intermoney protests that `` this year the large values at the row are . ''
Among the value winners the expert would rank the two major banks and some real estate companies , would be to expensive there `` the current sector to the given time . ''
Meanwhile Federico Olucha of the bank Inversis insures that the rises in connection will accompany with the bank and industrial sector .
If the Rally actually occurs , the real estate companies will profit from it .
`` the ACS was in the last months on catching up course and we hopes that other real estate companies hit such as Ferrovial and FCC the same way , '' so the expert .
Regarding the increased consumer behaviour during the Weihnachtstage in the last yearly half the periodic consumption will determine the market happening .
On the other hand the expert that also the technologies will obtain positive sales results , believes even if it on the Spanish market only in small number is represented .
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years December exhibited sinking course processes only in two cases .
When end of 2003 the technology blister burst , this led the stock exchange from its crisis and initiated at the same time the last material Endjahresrallye .
This year , in which the Ibex 35 caught up around 28,17 per cent points , exhibited December an improvement in prices of 6,68 % .
Whether 2008 become the fifth profitable year in consequence will show up ( the Ibex rises for January around 8,36 % ) and also a Endjahresrally to show can .

Political Capital : Hungarian guard increases state risk
In opinion of the department for risk analysis ( Risk Analysing division ) of Political Capital the activities in this August of the Hungarian guard created with support of the `` movement for a better Hungary '' raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard .
In the `` risk warning report '' of the institute it means among other things : In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk represents the `` aggravation of the ethnical tensions already existing between the gypsies and population of non -- gypsy in Hungary , who could lead even at short notice to violent ethnical arguments '' .
Principal reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard , which probably aims at the provocation of such an argument , so Forschungsinstitut .
How reports , this is regarded as omission on the part of that politically responsible persons : `` persons of the public life left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groupings , which developed now their political strategy on the Rome outer yarn contrast '' .
One assumes the fact that this intensify the problem , whom makes reasonable dialogue impossible extremities favour , as well as would increase the probability of violent arguments .
In addition the Forschungsinsitut means , which would have activities of the Hungarian guard , not least damaged owing to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media , `` the picture of Hungary abroad substantially , in particular which concerns the confidence in stability and democratic ripe ones '' .
We remember : Since autumn is 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing , so that since summer 2007 several were based , `` national self-defense association '' organizations calling .
`` these groupings it is common that they in each case define themselves as civilian organization , while they prahlen openly with the fact their members up - every now and then armed - tasks of defense to prepare ( disaster control , national defense , order guarding ) , with reference to the unfitness of the police , the army , and/or the state '' it was said .
And further : All this happens in accordance with that method , which tries , different , to camouflage on the policies and Parteiverdrossenheit of the population based , political efforts as civil initiative .
The stress of the civilian character and the association form serve thus not only the evasion of legal hurdles , which could emerge in the course of the entry with court - it is at the same time a political strategy .
How is to be inferred from the analysis , the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk-increasing factor also for the relations with the neighbour states .
`` in the last months the Hungarian guard in several neighbour states was quoted as potenzielle source of danger , so some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighboring countries sees in the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary politics .
All this has effects on the political stability of the region `` - it meant .
From the view of the research institute the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not a single phenomenon in central Eastern Europe , thus the political risk for the entire region grew .
As reports , the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable to the Bulgarian national guard , whose establishment was communicated in August 2007 by the right-wing extremist Bulgarian national union ( BNU ) with those .
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard were located the Rome to eating excesses , which took place in a borough of Sofia ( Krasna Poljana ) .
The BNU took the incidents equal to the cause for the establishment of the national guard , with the argument that the goal of the organization is the `` national protection '' .
According to their opinion a proper `` gypsy terror '' was in Bulgaria noticeable , the state remained however doless and indifferently - in such a way Political Capital in the past 17 years .
And further : The initiative would have kicked loose a violent debate in the Bulgarian public .
How said , also proven the increased risk for ethnical arguments by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to create for resistance purposes their own guard .
Since activities Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those Bulgarian national guard shows , not to exclude is it that the Hungarian Roma likewise , with which to the threats reacts , is called to organizing its own protection it in the risk warning report of Political Capital .
Attila Juhász , director of research with Political Capital said on request of the press agency : The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute .
Risk analysis report published , and should is informed annually risk-changing tendencies be recognizable , the public opinion , as in the case by the publication of the risk warning report .

Bungled operation assumes with death in new jersey
It was the day before the harvest thank celebration as Ronald Livingston by the large glasfenster of the Just A Little Healthier restaurant saw here and observed like an ambulance to the white Cape Cod two doors of far down at the west Scott Avenue continued .
Soon thereafter was there a police car .
And then was there a further .
`` then I saw the box cars of the medical Leichenbeschauers approaching '' , said Livingston , a surpervisor of the restaurant , on Wednesday .
`` that was the point as I knew that someone had died . ''
The Behoeren experienced that the dead Mrs. Olga Arroyo , 41 , was , a female assistant of the director of the Newarker of polizeidezernats .
Now the Ermittler tries to determine whether she died because of a procedure , which was accomplished by a not certified , cosmetic surgeon the police did not identify , and which in the house on the west Scott Avenue 212 worked .
The authorities do not have yet determined which Mrs. Arroyos death caused , and are hopeful that toxokologische investigations , whose results could not be available for weeks will help , to clear a mysterioesen death up which sent mourning by the Fuehrungspitze of the Newark police .
Mrs. Arroyo was since September 2006 a female assistant of the police director , Garry F. McCarthy , and their voice was many in the department well-known .
`` you loyal , working and persistent '' , said Mr. McCarthy was hard about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday .
`` you was my pit bulletin .
It protected me . ''
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the Mrs. von Jimmy Arroyo , a former Newarker police officer , who works for the Alkoholkontrollkomission , and that her leaves two sons , 14 and 11 , and a stepdaughter .

She was explained locally for death .
More than one week passed and the authorities few about her investigation communicated or about the owner of the house , who is specified as Flor Margarita Castro .
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs. Castro was asked by the authorities .
The Ermittler tries to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice .
On Wednesday nobody opened the door at for Mrs. Castros house , where a withered rose bush is located in the scarce vorgarten and a Dalmatiner behind the house barks .
A blue barrel marked with `` ethyl vanillin '' - uses as a replacement for vanilla in food and Parfums - sat in the parking lot beside a door , which led into the basement .
Two Mountainbikes hung of hooks on a side .
McCarthy said that as he arrived for the first time at Newark , after he had spent 25 years with the New York police section was Mrs. Arroyo of inestimable value and helped it thereby in the provinziellen and hard political culture in its new city to get along .
`` said you , must ' you to this or that pay attention ' '' , said he .
`` was you always here , when I arrived here and it was always here , when I went .
It was embarrassing . ''

Integration of slowakischer pupils at britschen schools does not succeed
In British schools the number of children from countries of Eastern Europe increases , which causes native fears with around the further development of the local public education .
The integration of the east Europeans encounters so far a row obstacles .
British schools determine even cases , where disputes between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in act of violence .
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe at britschen schools illustrates appropriate the case of North Kent , where the arguments between the native and slowakischen immigrants increase gradually .
Quarrels , chicaneries and brawls among pupils were passed to the relations between parents .
The situation developed already so far that the police in Chatham arrested a slowakische woman , who had struck a ten-year boy with a steel-pipe .
The accused one of defended itself with the fact that the boy insulted it by racistic insults .
The police had to intervene also after an attack of two girls under age on a slowakischen immigrant .
The girls had made allegedly racistic remarks opposite the man and had thrown him with stones .
`` as we home went , climbed a boy on a bus little house and spat on us .
When I said to him , he was to stop , threw he us with apples and pears and exposed then its gesaess , `` described a nut/mother of slowakischer pupils of the newspaper The Times a further unpleasant incident .
Complaints come from both sides .
One the native designated the controversy with the immigrants from Eastern Europe even as survival fight .
The aforementioned cases testify that the tendency between native ones and immigrants at British schools becomes ever more strained .
In Great Britain 70000 Slowaken are announced , which came on search for employment here .
About 30000 slowakische pupils therefore visit British schools .

Firer was at the Gulfstreamstand on last Friday during the millionaire exhibition , a four-daily Orgie of consumption placed to the schau , which was organized in an interlocked exhibition center at the outskirts of a town of the capital .
Additionally to Gulfstream more than 200 had developed other luxury offerers of booths , for it hoping , to interest again to money Russians come in everything of Mahagoni getaefelten yachts up to diamond-covered autocrickets , which would be appropriate for 50 cent .
Firer took carefully a shining orangenen Porsche at the next exhibition booth in the visor .
`` that is a beautiful car , but it is change in the comparison with us , '' said it .
`` to the United States Russia is the second largest market for private airplanes . ''
Heated up from an oil boom the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas at its gloss times .
`` we are gone through the same phase into the 1890ern , as if some Americans to gigantic wealth came and into crowds to Europe went , where they were regarded Goldman , a scientist at the Davis center for Russian and eurasische studies at the Harvard university as materialistic '' , said Mars-resound .
Like the Saudi Arabian over fliers of the 1970er and the Japanese into the 1990ern , the Russians step out as the freigiebigen money output unit most visible in the world .
The most exclusive luxury marks look for their portion of gold fever .
Elsewhere in Moscow in this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace , Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault , tightened the chairman of LVMH , in order to exchange ideas over it how one can sell hochpreisige goods on markets such as Russia .
( the conference is heard organized by The internationally Herald Tribune , those the New York Times company . )
Russia has 53 billionaires , who possess altogether 282 billion dollar , according to the Forbes list of richest humans .
Beyond that 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class , who are together 670 billion dollar worth , according to a study over the development of private possession in the former Soviet Union , which was written to an expert committee by experts of economic politics of the center for economics and financial research , here .
( the World Bank says that in the year lived 2005 15.8 per cent of the Russians under the subsistence level . )
`` there are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - therefore are we all here '' , said Nicole Marais , a sales and Vermarktungsrepraesentantin of David Morris , a Londoner juwelier .
It had for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the mark , the Soho Jewelry Group , which visits fair .
`` the women are maintained all exemplary and the men are worth all a fortune . ''
While they draw Sunday night in evening clothes by resounding , two call themselves real estate agent inside , Evgenia Yumatova , 21 , and Svetlana Turovtsova , 26 , and their clients as millionaires .
`` I looked after the cars and I try between the Infiniti , the Mercedes and the Porsche to decide '' , said Mrs. Yumatova , who delivered the designer clothes , which carried it , like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers .
The fair seemed to aim at it primarily new realms , the type of mark-conscious Russian buyers , who would be ready to visit several hours in the back-up to be located around a zugiges depot the geschmachloserweise Cadillac Escalades , taschenmesser from platinum , Moevenpick Eiskrem , custom-made Billiardti , Appartments in Dubai and Gund the teddybaeren placed next to each other .
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros ( 44,57 dollar ) .
`` the Russians are to be learned interested in it , which mark is the most expensive and best '' , said Mr. Gijrath , who sat patriotically at an exhibition booth of the Netherlands porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a wind-large Imitat of a rem Brandt picture from handpainted , blue mosaic stones .
`` natural are interested Russian more in Klimper Klimper . ''
Indeed the dealers say here the fact that the Russians with old money ( 10 to 15 years is old after Russian standards ) already induced themselves numbers of items limited from grossspurigen Logos to the kind of sober marks with , which did not mark themselves out with a commercial show became .
Nevertheless several thousand humans pushed whether millionaires , envoys of millionaires or simply tourists each day by resounding .
And some of them bought .
On the first night of the show on last Thursday novel said Ershov , which general managers of King Koil beds here , he would have two 70,000 dollar mattress set , manufactured from silk , Kashmir and cotton , with inserted gold threads , sells .
Likewise in the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov , a sales manager for A1 Moto said , to a company the High end cars with High end alarm systems equips that its company had sold the sharp orangenen Porsche for 170,000 dollar to a Russian millionaire .
Up to the Sunday afternoon , said Andrei Karapetian , which president of L.A . Connection , an enterprise , which adapts luxury cars on customer 's requests , he would have three motorcar radiator cricket for a Rolls-Royce phantom , which resembled linked with one another chain bracelets , for in each case 55,000 dollar sold .
It showed a reporter a motor-car tire , which was developed for a Russian owner of casino , with spokes , which it had covered with colored Swarovski crystals , so that it looked like a Rouletterad .
The costs : 22,000 dollar for a four-replacement .
`` the Russian millionaire , who or a picture of the face of its wife from cubic zirconium bunch leather wheels would like to have , will not drive necessarily on these wheels '' , said Mr. Karapetian .
`` it will keep it in its 30 or 40-Wagen garage . ''
Even if many of its Russian customers are rich , Mr. Karapetian said , the cliche `` Russiche of millionaires '' momentarily not much exclusivity would express , in view of the rise of the local real estate prices .
`` if you bought before three or four years a dwelling in Moscow , are them probably already to millionaire , at least on the paper , if already in cash '' , did not say it .
`` there are more from those than you believes . ''
Those , which were not millionaires could do at least in such a way , as if they would be rich at conditions , which were operated by Alliance Continental , a Russian administration of an estate enterprise .
The enterprise had four red telephone boxes after British model set up , was full-plugged with mountains of wrong million-dollar lights .
Azad Karryev , the director of marketing of the enterprise , said its coworkers 500,000 wrong notes for the millionaire fair would have printed out .
Passanten stopped to put in order to throw the heaps of money to leave mobile telephone photos , while they back-lean in the midst of the spare wealth , of friends knipsen or simply in order a few millions in .
`` seeing you , in Moscow can feel everyone like a millionaire '' , said Mr. Karryev .

Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutes from on Mondays to on Fridays 12 hours on the day .
Popular decided to modernize a large part of its branches .
Altogether 200 of it is settled in the most economiceconomics regions of Spain .
For Institut , who operates under the label name Popular max , these addresses mean a large milestone .
In addition , for the remaining Spanish institutes , since Popular represents as a first bankers ' syndicate the jump dares to extend and Saturday of 10h to 20.30h set the opening times of its branches of weekday to 20.30h .
The bankers ' syndicate BBVA , which is likewise reported the extension of their opening times in the addresses repeated reads , seized so far still no definite resolution .
The to time current negotiations of the bank with the trade unions seem an agreement to aim at , with which 75 % of all branches of Saturday are closed and but at a weekday to open in the afternoon , if also not for customers .
Whether further banks of the new initiative follow will depend , which adapts to the business opening times , on the empirical values of the Popular bank .
And straight that is also the intention , which pursues Popular with its project .
A goal is it to extend the opening times of those branches those due to its layer purchase-merry customers of independent , small and centralconstant enterprises , in addition , those of large department stores to seize can .
The bank would like to open the new 200 branches in the course of the coming 18 months , there it around new , but changed opening times does not act .
But the bank will transform the premises of those addresses , which already are in business zones , and them at the same time the individual customer profile of the different zones to adapt .
Thus the extension of the opening times is connected with a new spatial arrangement of the branches , which is characterised by a more current , farbenfroheres Design .
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera insures the fact that the restructuring does not require larger investments , but with a increased personnel attitude , there a branch would accompany now no longer six , but eight or nine employees needed .
The addresses , which will be equipped even with the additional premises for the KMU , will sell no financial products .
A positive experience for the group
Popular already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid .
And the empirical values failed positively , so Ángel Rivero .
The addresses of the roads Bravo Murillo , O'Donell and the Gran Vía were selected for it which an intelligent resolution seems to have been .
Popular leads momentarily approx.. 2500 addresses .
And further 60 , which operate under the name Mundocredit . These are specialized in immigrants and exhibit likewise extended opening times , even at sunning and holidays .
In these branches of PopularMax the model of the BBVA is not used , since most of them instead for the sales will offer a broad selection of non -- financial services .
`` we would like to represent no competition for our customers '' , explain Rivero .
With Telefonica they came provisionally to the agreement to sell assistance of external bank personnel of mobile telephones .

All by right to make want - or as one becomes uninteresting for others
Stop and go-traffic , the car in the middle in the all-morning back-up .
From the radio a strange melody rings out : The sound of a violin , paired with electronic effects .
I turn the volume more highly .
The speed changes , to the past sounds comes the bass , and as genuine sound jewel a female choir .
It is the song `` Wings OF Love '' from Zagar , which rings out on mr2 .
The domestic music scene does not have us long time straight delicately with qualitative Electropop .
But one sees even the back-up now differently , if one hears thereby the new album of Zagar .
The appearance of Yonderboi , so some new and exciting production from the domestic digital Underground scene contribute slowly to a change of the overall view , and even if the garage skirt with its Gitarrengequit again `` in '' is , to which domestic Electropop proves : There is new under the sun .
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs , made music even in the volumes Yonderboi , before he - perhaps , because a pub does not stand two Pfeifer - its own way to walk on began .
It created the break-through with its project ( Zagar ) and its music , which merge elements from jazz , electronics , and Pop , however only as one with the request to compose the sound TRACK to a film to him had come closer ( e.g .
`` Szezon '' of Ferenc Toeroek ) .
The formation , which had arisen at first in smaller clubs , became known to the broader public only , than the magazine `` wan2 '' lined its first album up from the year 2002 under the Top 50 domestic albums and Zagar , together with Yonderboi , kuerte to the almost only , also trendsetter marketable in the west .
Without a doubt Zagar were and its volume `` trendy '' , it interested however none whether they carried this mark also gladly .
The volume reacted , as it should : With a new , still better album .
The new album with the title `` CAN emergency , appeared now , mill Fly Instead '' could to them new ways open , however the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years .
The expression comes of to the time , when Balázs Zságer was still with another volume on the way .
The airy , flying allusion would be also correct , however the influences of the Rock'n'Roll are noticeable apart from the ethereal character of the music - the spirit of the time and the trend appropriate - the louder guitar .
With these songs in England living and with that volume `` The puzzle '' thought of working singers Gyoergy Ligeti with the premiere in the Millenáris .
A song of the album it even to the radio hit created - which has sending mr2 Pet ? fi since newest one from early to late Popmusik the listeners with the number `` Wings OF Love '' , which was taken up under co-operation by six domestic singers ( `` Underground Divas '' ) , gradually the ear worm set .
Everything in order thus ( ? ) .
Hvg.hu with Balázs Zságer inquired .
hvg.hu : This new hit raises the question : To what extent does your music of a certain layer remain reserving ?
Balázs Zságer : The term `` layer music '' does not mean me straight much .
According to my opinion there is two box in the Popmusik , not Mainstream and Underground , or alternative and Pop , but commercial and honestly .
Even the so-called alternative or Underground music can be shallowly and insignificant , exactly the same can it in addition , only for the sales be produced , which makes it commercial music .
Also a good Pop number can develop from an honest motive .
The acceptance of the listener functions also according to this principle , from languages and national borders independently .
hvg.hu : Do you face with a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign public your music ?
B . Zs . : Abroad , in particular west of us the Popmusik has a larger tradition .
There goes not only dte rodent or Twens on concerts , but also the older public .
They pursue the trends in the Popmusik , which happen around them , many more attentively , because they regard them also as a part of the contemporary culture .
hvg.hu : Which role comes the public too with your work ?
Is it important , who , where , how many hears your music ?
B . Zs . : It is natural a good feeling to see that ever more come to our concerts .
We however never composed for the market .
With us the music does not develop , in order to serve a purpose , but for a certain reason .
The role of the public is mostly noticeable with the concerts , where there is already a mutual reciprocal effect , but it gives again only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment .
One were noticeable to me nevertheless : If you want to make it quite for all , you are no longer interesting .
hvg.hu : How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi ?
It is as soloist on the way and its career rather in the west developed .
B . Zs . : We do not go really its way , times of the fact completely apart that one tries again and again to in-interpret this into our music .
We see ourselves rather as Teamplayer , which can trust on the musical operational readiness level of the other one and be unfolded them .
At first were naturally comparisons of our work with from Yonderboi inevitable , since several from us its volumes come and hit another way .
hvg.hu : In the Charts of mr2 Pet ? fi stands for `` Wings OF Love '' in the first place .
Many heard the name Zagar only in connection with this number .
Was the opening with a somewhat more popular style consciously produced toward a broader public ?
B . Zs . : We did not have plans to write a hit which was to then hold as a course horse for the album .
In this song it concerns more .
It was meant as final of the album , with which we wanted to dissolve the Klangorgie and the somewhat more difficult topics .
hvg.hu : How did you select the six singers ?
Why straight it , which was the guidance principle ?
B . Zs . : The basic idea was to make a Gospel well-behaved choir .
Then the idea came to arrange the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene .
Thus did the sechskoepfige choir develop - thus for Sena , Edina Kutzora , Judie Jay , Bori Péterfy , Enik ? Hodosi [ Neo ] , Juci Németh - , which we baptized then more apaeter `` Underground Divas '' .
hvg.hu : Did you want to have the song exactly the same , or it the girls codesigned ?
B . Zs . : The number gave it already longer in the instrument valley version , but than the material for the album was finished , we imagined that this number needs still `` something '' .
The chord succession required formally for a singing voice .
I in-sang the melody still at the same night , learned later her the girls .
It came everything practically at first attempt and frightening spontaneously .
I can remember , I was at that time rather electrified , but already also the `` Divas '' required .
With my voice alone the song would have become never so strong .
hvg.hu : Both on the plate , and with the concert one had however the impression , the girls would be in the background .
There is no solo part ( apart from the short solo one from Judy Jay ) , it has no own role , sings perfectly together and is not not louder , than the music , therefore its singing of the music only not accompanied .
Also on the stage they stood in the back .
Is it intention ?
B.Zs . : The fact that they are confessed in the back was because of purely technical problems like that .
However we wanted them consciously to give no solo roles .
In the number it goes also forgetting therefore that one is to forget its Ego a little , who from where come and where on the way is , we permit simply that us these certain wings , which raise wings of the love .
I would like that also different feel this euphoric condition , which we felt , when the song developed .
hvg.hu : Which was the most complex song ?
B . Zs . : With the musical work work actually none , it gave more difficult tasks rather when mixing .
For example with `` Dorian Gray 's dilemma '' , in which I play on a concert piano , or with `` Rock'n'Roll Goes ton of The Girls '' , where the Groove did not want to function longer , but gradually joined itself everything , as with a puzzle .
hvg.hu : Which is your favourite number of the new album ?
B . Zs . : Changes with the concerts constantly and still , where I the album `` losgelasssen '' has .
At present there is `` prophet Is A Fool '' , `` escape From The Earth '' and the number `` Never The same '' .

Cuba - most beautiful island of the Karibik
For visitors it is real an island of the liberty .
Which always you expect from your vacation , which will fulfill itself , if you select only the correct .
Golden and white beaches , high waves or a sea , which are calm like a pond .
Palms and universe Inclusive with waiters , who offer Pizza , ice and betoerende cocktails at the beach .
Kitesurfing , gulf and roulette .
On the islands of the Karibik you find in redundant measure .
Only on an island you find however still much more , and this island is Cuba , the largest and most beautiful of the large Antilleses .
At present the Spaniard was Cuba their bastion for conquest America .
Kolumbus called it the most beautiful place , which one human eye each saw .
Havanna became once a camp or a transit camp of treasures , which had robbed the Spaniards in America and then to Europe transported .
And then the American epoch came .
The hotel Nacional originated in completely at the end 20 . Century .
To build it left to one of the bosses of the American mafia , Lucky Luciano , because everything that applied in the USA as crime ( particularly during the prohibition ) , became on Cuba gladly seen and supports - drugs , gambling , prostitution .
Among its guests were among other things .
Winston Churchill , Ava Gardner , franc Sinatra .
In Havanna multistoried buildings grew , over the broad boulevards drove cars , which ranked among the cult symbols of the fifties of the past Jahrhundets .
Ernest Hemingway bought a messuage in San Francisco de Paula , in whom proximity of Havannas , and in Cojímar he had his yacht to lie .
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio star of the show Business and politician out completely their signatures left America .
And today ?
At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna also you can leave your autograph .
At the bar in the hotel Nacional one mixes cocktails completely for you according to desire .
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havanna until today , because the once imported Schigulis and Fiat in salty and damp air fell apart already long .
Havanna , in particular its oldest part , may not have strongly heruntergekommen , anywhere finds one in the periphery as many marvelous colonial objects of interest here as straight .
Other places are out-deseamed straight , for example Trinidad .
In view to it that the tourism brings urgently needed money , it gave it for this development green light .
In the last fifteen years not only in Havanna new hotels developed , but also in Varadero , at the coast of the province Holguín and also on Inselchen such as Cayo Coco , Cayo Guillermo and other one .
Cuba offers still another Marotte , which is singular in the world and tightens above all railway lover .
Steam and the same-trieven narrow-gauge railways brought the zuckerrohr of remote plantagen to the sugar factories .
Their vehicle park was not renewed over decades , and so one sees there putzige and fully functioning locomotives , whose lengthen contemporary elsewhere in the museum .
Trip goals
The majority of the visitors of Cuba does not omit the bedeutendendsten places .
So one does not have to write over Varadero or Havanna any longer in detail .
It remains mentioning only that in already the mentioned is messuage Hemingways a museum , whose attendance should not to be able to be escaped that , which likes this writer .
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most pictorial angles of Cuba .
The sumptuous vegetation grows on lime soil .
The Mogotas , lime hill and rock , rise steeply from the valley soil , in its cavities accumulated fruitful soil , by which rock ranges also weathered are covered by close vegetation .
This valley is it , where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is cultivated .
In its end form you can meet it , if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havanna .
Possibly it appears some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV serial `` major Zeman '' was turned there .
Trinidad
An age-old city , which was created briefly , after the Spaniards had colonized the island .
Fame and wealth brought you the trade with slaves and sugars .
The wealth embodied itself in decorations the beauty of the small city .
Spanish colonial architecture , strongly affected by the later French settlers , hardly changed for four hundred years .
Trinidad , between which sea and the Escambray mountains convenient , is a so remote place that there was no road , which would have connected the area with the remaining country there still in the fifties of the last century .
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unconsidered .
Nothing was built , but therefore also nothing torn off , for everyone was glad there that he had a roof over the head .
If one has more than one afternoon time for Trinidad , then it is worthwhile itself to regard interesting places in the environment as for instance the beach Playa Ancón or the `` valley of the sugar factories '' .
In the evening one should go then into the Casa de la Música , which animates itself after the darkness , and where the music is not silent up to the morning .
Baracoa
Some call this small town in the east of Cuba completely the most beautiful of the island .
Surely this opinion is affected also by the way there .
Both roads , which lead from Guantánamo there , must overcome high and zerkueftete mountains and run by a landscape , which is hardly affected by human interferences .
The UNESCO took up this eastern Vorposten Cuba owing to there unaffected nature to its world inheritance listing .
There best chocolate manufactured , in church shows one cross of Kolumbus ( in reality it developed about hundred years after the travels of Kolumbus ) , and of hills , where the former castle , which stands current hotel El Castillo , are several board mountains to see , from those El Yunque the most well-known are .
Over coffee , which rum , which cigars , which Sierra Maestra mountains , which pig bay and the island Isla de Pinos , over whom Tropicana tropicana-Kabarett , which Heiligtum of of the Cuban Patronin Caridad del Cobre , over whom Santeria , an African religion , to which the descendants of slaves profess themselves , over all that one could many sides write .
But , as one says in such a way : Better with own eyes regard .

Banks want to master crisis
The American Federal reserve , the European central bank and the central banks of Great Britain , which Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets .
Thus more than 100 billion dollar by means of auctions at the currency markets will arrive .
On these auctions auction the banks of interest rates , to which they are ready mutually money to borrow .
For example the American Fed sends 40 billion dollar on auction , further 24 makes it loose for the European one and the Swiss central bank .
It is after the notices 11-Septembers the first time that the central banks of the individual states agree on an in such a manner coordinated procedure for the defense and/or reducing the consequences of a financial crisis .
`` this step is to eliminate the largest difficulties of the economy , thus the increasing lack of freely available capital , which the banks can lend , '' wrote in a report for its customers Berne pool of broadcasting corporations Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group .
`` the coordinated action of the central banks reduced the probability of a recession in the USA of 65 % to approximately 50 % , added '' Baumohl in its report .
The banks already lost because of not served credits by 60 billion dollar , particularly in the United States .
Analysts expect still further billion-losses .
`` `` the central banks must have really had fear before it , which still everything can follow , when to this procedure decided , `` said the chief economist of ABN Amro , Kieran Davies .
`` it looks in such a way that the situation is really bad , '' continued to say he .
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have heavily entrance to loans , for their customers of credits become also more expensive .
That would reduce the consumption and would fall the American economy into a recession , possibly with effects on the economic growth on the whole world .
The central banks decided to after they had not succeeded , which sucked . To lower LIBOR , the Londoner interbank rate , which is used with the moneylending between banks .
That means it that the banks had constantly fear to borrow itself mutually money and although the central banks of the USA , Canada and Great Britain during the autumn their interest rates had several times lowered .
`` that will have the same effect as a further sinking of the interest rates , '' said Greg Salvaggio of tense Consulting of the agency Reuters .
Some analysts are the opinion that this step of the central banks contributes the case of the property market in the USA to the heating of the crisis , because it does not solve the fundamental problem .

Revolting soldiers in Manila give up
On the Philippines revolting soldiers gave up , who in a hotel in Manila entrenchd and whom Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had demanded fall of president .
It can answer for no blood pouring , said the leader Antonio Trillanes , which accused corruption and electoral fraud to the president , reporters in the hotel .
Government loyalty soldier the hotel under tear gas employment had stormed before .
Those approximately two dozen of soldiers had entrenchd themselves for hours in the building .
Half of them stood for Trillanes approximately on Thursday because of a failed Putschversuchs in the year 2003 before court - under them .
It used the negotiation , in order to suddenly set off with approximately 30 sympathizers .
The military policemen , who should actually guard him , had overflowed obviously to him and followed its meuterei .
They penetrated Gloria Macapagal Arroyo into the Peninsula hotel and demanded the fall of president .
Loyale government troops closed the district around the distinguished hotel off .

Richard Gere is simply not zynisch enough
With `` The Hunting party '' and `` Moerderi peace '' are occupied again two films with the Balkans war .
But both do not convince .
Either the concepts set too much on Action and Geballer or however them are too agitate blessed .
There also Richard Gere in `` The Hunting party '' can not help .
The good message first : The war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide themselves still in the mountains of the Balkans , but just there , in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war , now the actor Richard Gere was regained .
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties-years last , because all too many nice-inconsequential roles in well-being feeling films for women and all too many press conferences drove the desire out on Hinsehen about Buddhismus .
Now is Richard Gere sudden the most important argument , itself `` The Hunting party - if the hunter to the chase becomes '' ( why to have film titles today actually always as long and confused to be as engine driver collective agreements ? ) to regard perhaps nevertheless .
It supplies a marvelously augenzwinkernde representation : Strictly speaking its war reporter Simon Hunt is what from Gere could have become , if the fate and the filmbranche were not so benevolent : A man , who has its very best times for a long time behind itself , who retained its fall still considerable remainders of the former charm however even as ruin-same monument .
But despite this trumpfes `` The Hunting party '' sets the endless number of failed Balkans war films together with the German production of `` Moerderi peace '' , which likewise starts in this week , only away .
With `` Moerderi peace '' one can make short process : The film acts of two German soldiers in the Kosovo ( Adrian Topol , max of Riemelt ) , which saves a Serbin from kosovarischen snipers , on which the one promptly also still with her falls in love .
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are here once not explained as exclusive root of all evil , the televisionflat film loses itself all too fast in Geballer and Action .
A kind `` alarm for Cobra 11 '' remains without motorway however for it with war .
On the other hand can be investigated at `` The Hunting party '' almost exemplary , why it did not give actually ever a correctly good Balkans war film .
Perhaps the history of three US war reporters , who open themselves , in order to seek out the Serbian upper war criminal `` the fox '' , could have become with another director and another film script author ( both in personnel union Richard Shepard ) to another time a new `` Apocalypse Now '' .
Because the stories resemble each other striking : Both marks go small teams into the forest , in order to achieve somewhat , what military to be able and both marks does not become it a journey into the insanity .
One of the reasons for the failure of `` The Hunting party '' is that one does not let Simon Hunt be simple the heruntergekommenen cynic with heart , when who is presented he us at the beginning .
No , the Script must it in addition still another romantic affair with a late murdered Muslim Bosnierin andichten .
Finally `` The Hunting party '' does not go then the brook down , if within the last five minutes in the quick-motion apparatus procedure succeeds to the reporters , what NATO , CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years creating : The war criminal catch and the Muslim Bosniern to the fair revenge left .
That is so bad that one would like to call the international Court of Justice into the Hague because of crimes against the cinema logic .
The film has a deeply human request .
It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic rumlaufen still freely , and it does not suspect the Americans and the Frenchmen ( here they are to be exeptionally times united ) pursuit due to secret political arrangements too to operate intensively .
But well the meaning and the bad are sometimes so similar itself that a famous breaking poem comes into the sense .
Therein it means over the holzmaske of an asiatic Daemons on the workbench of the poet : to `` I see the swollen front veins suggesting Mitfuehlend , : like it is arduous , to be bad `` .
Films like `` The Hunting party '' have exactly such swelling heads , however suggest , like it are arduous to be good .
The problem is not limited to the category of the Balkans war film .
Recently it is in this newspaper reports that all Iraq films Hollywoods were large flops .
One can add : It did not give also ever a good South Africa film .
Nearly always applies : If a star on the crisis centres or mine fields of the world roams itself , then comes as thereby raus as `` Rangoon '' with Patricia Arquette , `` the other world of all borders '' with Angelina Jolie or `` blood diamond '' with Leonardo DiCaprio .
Possibly all the conflicts are temporally simply still too close .
Decades had nevertheless to offense , before Hollywood with `` Schindlers list '' could turn a good film over the Holocaust .
Some film will probably still mature - those as classical authors of valid Viet Nam works `` The Deer Hunter '' , `` Apocalypse Now '' or `` Full Metal jacket '' were not celebrated at that time now by any means unanimously as masterpieces .
Perhaps but we know today , where each mass murder comes into real time on equivalent two screens at home , also simply too much about the conflicts of the world .
And the Bedenkenlosigkeit , which needs it , in order to tell good stories , robs from the film script writers .
`` its or Nichtsein '' or `` the large dictator '' became so good finally also , because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet , how badly the Nazi regime really prevailed .
Perhaps one may not want to be good , if one wants to make good films .
Perhaps one must have the sarkastisch dissociated artist view of the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk .
When to parallels between its historical novel `` Lemprières was asked the dictionaries '' and the Balkans war , he answered : `` it is only because of the fact that some things never change .
Large cities will be always terriblly dangerous , humans become in greyful way to be always murdered and to war in Yugoslavia will always prevail . ''

Klaus : Debates of the ecologists are unbelievable
Global climatic changes harm allegedly developing countries at most .
President Václav Klaus expressed itself again for the problem of the global heating up .
The criticism referred now to the international conference of the UN going to end to the climatic change to Bali .
In Vienna , where he presented his book `` bluer , no greener planet '' , it implemented that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable .
According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference is inakzeptabel , which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such from non-government organizations , but also the fundamental difference between the Rhetorik , which accompanies it , and which reality .
`` the debate is unstructured there , it is word fireworks , only replacement is for a real solution of present problems , '' said Klaus .
The Czech president stressed with the conception of his book that its topic for him was very important , and that it for it therefore engage itself in such a way .
It expressed also its satisfaction over the fact that its book in German translation appears , because `` I often meet on caricatures of my opinions . ''
Now prospective customers could reread its attitude thus undistorted .
Klaus reminded of the fact that it was not Klimatologe , but it has according to its opinion sufficient conditions , in order to write such a book .
It is finally of university graduates , capable of , to understand and judge technical papers , has experience with statistics and is also a political economist .
When it designated main statement of the book the thesis that the climate constantly changes and that its changes are thus normal that it does not give an agreeing opinion among the scientists to the ground electrode warming that the consequences of the present changes are not too large and serious and represented thus no threat , and that the efforts are aufwaendig to affect the development of the climate redundantly , ineffectively and inakzeptabel .
Beyond that consider it it as someone , which has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen , unacceptable , to other unproven opinions to force upon , it regard as dangerous restriction of the liberty .
On questions of present one explained it repeated , it is not against `` a reasonable environmental protection , but against militant Oeko Aktivisten , no consideration take on the relationship between expenditure and yield . ''
About the same topic Klaus in Vienna had already spoken two months ago ago in Hayek Hayek-Institut .

Fodor and the six Hungarian per cent
How secretary of the environment communicated Gábor Fodor , the expert meetings go on Tuesday to end , and the debate over the international air conditioning after 2012 is continued by the Ministers on Wednesday after the official opening .
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise over the timetable of Bali , in which the emission-reducing measures are fixed for the time after 2012 , thus at expiration of Kyoto minutes .
At present a violent debate between industrie and developing countries is under way .
The USA signaled already that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers , however would be ready it to reduce to 2020 the greenhouse gas missions compared with 1990 by 25-40 per cent .
The other large question of the conference is to be supported , whether the industrial nations are ready , apart from the reduction of the emissions the developing countries both financially , and technologically .
Also an agreement was obtained over the support by developing countries .
That Kyoto minutes subordinated adjustment funds is to be administered by a 16-koepfigen advice , presumably at the global Umweltfazilitaet ( GEF ) the UN , as in the `` Piac és profit '' is to be reread .
Of Hungary six per cent
Secretary of the environment Gábor Fodor supports the effort of the European Union in the name of Hungary to maintain their role of the pioneer with global climatic preventive measures to obtain and until 2009 a new international agreement .
The Minister explained , who European Union to 2020 by 20 % will reduce the greenhouse gas missions ( based on the values of 1990 ) , independently of it whether the `` agreement is successfully obtained after 2012 '' , or not . The union would be even ready to use itself for a 30-prozentige reduction soferne other large industrial nations of the world , and/or developing countries are likewise ready to follow their obligations after forces and responsibly .
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states , which had joined 1997 Kyoto minutes was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent , whereas the European Union with their had already committed itself at that time 15 member states to a minus of 8 % .
The default for Hungary reads reduction of the greenhouse gas missions around 6 % compared with the years 1985-87 - a default , which will quite fulfill the country , as is to be reread in the press release of the Department of the Environment .
The employment is high on Bali - nevertheless the long-term international climaticpolitical agreement must be finished within two years , otherwise it would only enter into force with security after 2012 . In this case no renewed , international emission reduction system would follow the reduction projects specified in Kyoto minutes , whose meaning also the IPCC , which emphasized international scientific climatic change committee of the UN in its recent report , distinguished with the Nobel peace prize .
Thus the emission reduction would retard , and the increase of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2°C would be unavoidable , which would entail extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to Wissenschaftern .

England confronts with decision over the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas , everyone of it nearly just as with difficulty as the other one .
Who is to strike Owais Shah as number 6 for England in Kandy on this weekend , or Ravi Bopara ?
And , not less relevantly in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka , who is to make the decision ?
The second question is important , because David Graveney , which is a choice chairman , on call at least under this special title , here , in order to decide to help the coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan thereby , and because itself the table of High Morries , which English acting director , gradually with applications for national offices for voter fills , if not even for which in partial time .
Whoever does not get the sixth racquet position , will be unfortunate , but the life is often unfair and the sport is undoubted it .
It is never simply , exact festzunageln , which makes humans possible the point its branch of profession to reach , while somebody else never beyond lowest rank , sometimes from lack of luck instead of ability .
It is not only in the kricket , where the selection is difficult , where judgements are necessary , which are subjective at the end always .
Is it to be ascended the correct time for Bopara ?
Is it fair to Shah if he it does ?
The same can be asked perhaps also in a wider range whether for example John Edward or `` Tubby '' Banerjee , both should be carried intelligent young high-level personnel with good conclusions , which know the business well .
Who can say , what the correct class for a Kricketspieler is , it is , it the possibility is given to swim or go down .
Of course numbers have a large influence on decisions , but chances have this also .
Within a team a Kricketspieler must catch the eye of the captain at the correct time , if he can take a Wicket and a racquet must regular chances on the order gets , if he wants to make impression as an one-day Kricketspieler .
The eyes of the choice devices to catch is more complicated .
There were many , which in the last season better than , for example , than James Anderson one were , which will apparent play in the first test , even if Stephen Harmison kegelt itself for healthy avowedly and like the wind into the nets .
Anderson one took 32 first-class Wickets with ever 33 of run , in order to earn a position in this route .
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average , but both had their points of gloss and to hope for still more .
Whether Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stage plays , only one opinion question can be .
The choice could decide the careers of both men , or it makes little difference perhaps nevertheless .
Before four years in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty in each test played and was successfully in first , with five Wickets and 40 of useful run , it was however Paul Collingwood , at that time fighting for itself to be still strengthened , the break-through to an important Testkricketspieler created and that , although he scored a double one hundred against Australia in Australia , is perhaps still underestimated .
It is probable that Graveney , Vaughan and moorland , after a further discussion in the course of the today 's net meeting in the Asgiriya stage will follow their conservative instincts and belly feeling for Shahs larger experience over Boparas juvenile enthusiasm .
There are arguments for both .
For Shah speak its sparkling and valuable 88 test debut Innings in Bombay , 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara , which is seven years younger with 22 years , and a exzellente balance against turned balls .
But Shah made only ten of run in its two Innings in the May against west Indies in the test in lord , for its homeland arena as a player from Middlesex , and this , plus its immediate refusal of the choice devices as Vaughan was healthy in order to take its position back for the next play , seems the momentum from its striking to have taken which was obvious still in Bombay .
In contrast to it the Jack of all trades from Essex has schaufelweise joy of life .
It is impressed and its attitude off of it on the point was brought of nothing on a Kricketplatz , when it had estimated recently a vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen .
It probably suffered smaller injuries and a shock , but first , which he did , was to be taken out its Vodafone ( naturally also gesponsort ) and to be called its team colleague Alastair Cook , which had observed this from the distance to say and with enthusiasm : `` haste you that seen ? `` .
Bopara is a many better field player , he kegelt its central speed with some effect here on the playing fields , which seems to fit him and strikes with zuversicht and fate .
The correct man to select a thing is to select the correct time another .
Perhaps that is the actual art of the selection .
To give I slope in addition Bopara now its chance , what does not mean that Shah will not stand there perhaps nevertheless well , if , as the dte set from Ceylon suggests , it is that , which will play this weekend here .

The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan for the point for the round of the last sixteen
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight on coming Tuesday in San Siro for the point , which is missing to them , in order to achieve their respective goals still before conclusion of the championsleague before round . The Italians need to arrive the point over at the point of their group , while this decides with the Scots on its participation .
The Italian crew already confirmed already five points and to have their participation in the fifth round with an undecided in Portugal , while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs still another further , in order to go surely that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up the Befica Lisbon with four points .
The two plays of the group of D will take place one week before end of the sixth play round , since the FC Milan at the FIFA club world championship in Japan must begin , where it will fight at the 13ten in the semi-final for the first time for the entrance in the final , which takes place on 16th .
Like that this group before all different will be final and the undecided in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to the all-side expected result , even if both teams will try to win . The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltik Glasgow white , which they in the case of a victory group first will and so that a better starting position in the round of the last sixteen would have .
Of the FC Shakhtar a defeat could be sufficient for the crew of Gordon Strachan around itself qualify even with a Schlappe . Nevertheless he should trust not too much in such circumstances , because at nine points resembling and is entitled to the Ukrainern the participation ; those last week in Glasgow had lost ( 2-1 ) , but with the second play to win could ( 2-0 ) .

While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of the `` Rossoneri '' , the crew will have itself to concentrate on the own play , since both reaching the eighth final and its membership depend with the UEFA on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow .
The Benfica Lisbon would know despite its lower table position and without the prospect to be allowed to participate further in the largest European championship achieve by a victory the third place and along-play thus with the UEFA .

Weihnachtsfeier with tombola and Pogat in the Ministries
Work minister Mónika Lamperth is not by any means zimperlich : Instead of a Weihnachtsfeier she organizes a conference of work , at which her coworkers can let the year 2007 with coffee and Pogat end .
Some Ministries celebrate other charms Weihnachtsstimmung with tombola or knocking against with live-musik , into the official hearts .
Party , Weihnachtsstimmung , concerts and Buffet - in such a way power celebrates .
The Weihnachtsfieber seized already also the offices .
The largest Weihnachtsfeier of a Ministry is held this year in the defense department , however in addition the coworkers of the Ministry are not expected .
Presented with the `` Weihnachtsfeier of the orphans '' children of pleased soldiers , with which `` mission celebration '' family members become regaled from at present soldiers stationed abroad , in addition , it gives a receipt for the press .
The department makes approximately 25 millions available for the ceremonies .
Compared with other departments the national agency for development ( NFUe ) and the Ministry for economics and traffic strike over the strands .
Expensive Weihnachtsfeier of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the house of the future held , it will become about 350 of the 600 coworkers expected the 4,32 millions Forint .
The emphasis of the ceremonies is on Christmas , it in addition , to live-acts and a tombola drawing will give .
The national agency for development ( NFUe ) held its 4.7 millions Forint expensive Weihnachtsfeier on Wednesday in the house of the national senior counsel ( OIT ) , with concerts and a festessen .
The hall rent amounted to 1 million Forint , the remainder on the more than 400 loaded guests was spent .
After our information a department of the NFUe is invited also with another Weihnachtsfeier , which is organized by the Hungarian economic development center ( Zrt LIKES ) from European Union funds .
For the celebration the building of the lustspieltheaters ( `` Vígszínház '' ) was rented .
Those LIKES Zrt these information did not confirm , since we did not reach the responsible persons .
For what the suit ?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFUe , but also the Ministry for law and police nature , which held the Lucia ball there instead of a Weihnachtsfeier on 7 December .
They did not have to pay a rent for the use of the premises to the OIT .
Approximately 500 visitors came to the ball .
The ceremonies with a speech of the Minister were opened , after whom Dinner gave it to live-musik to dances .
On request of [ origo ] one divided with : It did not prevail at the ball ball dress or a suit obligation .
The Ministries for health , work , and autonomy prepare in each case for puritanische celebration .
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the coworkers in the own four walls for approximately 400,000 Forint .
Work minister Mónika Lamperth does not load her coworkers officially to a Weihnachtsfeier , but yearlyended to the conference to .
One expects approximately 180 guests , who - so the press department - are regaled only with coffee and Pogat , then goes out itself the celebration with 350.000 Forint .
Autonomy Minister Gordon Bajnai will knock against with his colleagues simply only in the aula of the Ministry .
The Treasury ( PM ) organizes a Weihnachtsfeier in the own festival room , to which 436 coworkers are expected .
The expenditures were measured with 2.500 Forint per head - around this money there is a Buffet receipt with following knocking against .
Since beginning of the term of office of János Veres the coworkers of the PM celebrate each year in this way .
However no correct party tendency will arise - not only because of the official speech of the Minister but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon .
The Ministry Of Agriculture loads to 20 . Jaenner to a New Year receipt , the Weihnachtsfeier of the Ministry precipitates this time .
One asks the one hundred guests in the lock Vajdahunyad in the city park ( `` Városliget '' ) ; according to information of the department the expenditures with 1.000 Forint per guest are limited .
As the press department announces , it becomes a very simple standing receipt , to which only into Hungary accredited foreign diplomats are loaded .
The receipts , which are organized each year , begin traditionally with a short speech of the Minister and end with reserved Schmausen .
How the enstprechenden pressestellen announce on [ origo ] request , it will give neither with the outside nor with the education Ministry a Weihnachtsfeier .
Asked for the costs of the Weihnachtsfeier one could not give information at the press department of the Department of the Environment .
Anyhow more than 400 guests were loaded to the celebration , which is organized in the museum of arts and crafts .

Chávez changes the clocks over
In Venezuela the clocks tick shortly differently than in the remainder of the world .
On 9 December president Hugo Chávez lets the zeitmesser in the South American country turn back around a half hour .
In Spain Chávez becomes meanwhile the joke figure .
As the Official Journal of Venezuela communicated , according to a new law the clocks are adjusted to the world time minus four and one-half hours .
Thus the suedamerikansiche state gets a time belt , which gives it in no other country in the world .
The USA-HOSTILE Chávez justified its decision among other things with the fact that the United States of the world would have imposed the organization into time belts to full hours .
Besides Chávez quit the breaking off of the relations with the neighboring country Colombia on Wednesday ( local time ) because of a hostage affair announced .

`` I can not already alone because of mine will '' , said to Chávez , which advances a constitutional reform , over which the citizens of the oil producing country on Sunday in a referendum co-ordinate must .
With the reform he would clearly develop his power in the country .
Trip of the controversy was the decision Uribes to extract from Chávez the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia with whom it went around the release from hostages .
Uribe has Venezuela with its decision `` in the face spat '' , Chávez on Sunday had criticized .
Also in Spain Chávez is in all mouth .

Venus is the hoellische twin of the earth
The Venus is more similar despite their life-hostile atmosphere of the earth than so far meant : The European space probe `` Venus express '' discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind eddies to Poland , how they arise in the winter also on earth .
For nearly three decades scientists assume that it flashes on the Venus .
Now the European probe `` Venus express '' furnished the proof - it sought out electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere : Lightnings on the Venus shoot at a value of approximately 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud , report Christopher Russel of the University OF California in Los Angeles in the science magazine `` Nature '' .
According to the famous `` Ursuppen theory '' lightning let the life on earth develop : Thunderstorms are to have reactions lively , which led to the formation of amino acids in the ocean , the components of the life .
Not so on the Venus : `` if it ever lives gave there , must have been it in very early history '' , explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington .
Today there might be something alive on the surface of the Venus hardly : The atmosphere is approximately hundreds times more closely than on earth , it prevails every now and then to temperatures of 500 degrees .
`` the Venus is perhaps the devil twin of the earth , but she is a twin '' , said Russel .
Why the Venus , which is so similar to the earth in mass and size , hit so completely different development , is the basic question of the Esa mission .
The start of `` Venus express '' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research , since since beginning of the nineties no more probe was particularly for the study of this planet on the way .
The newest research results , which are presented now in several `` Nature '' articles , do not only underline the singularness of the Venus in opinion of the researchers within the solar system .
`` you show also that the thing in common of our neighbour planet with the earth is larger than first accepted '' , communicate the Esa .
Thus the researchers beside that found already admitted to eddy wind at the north pole also a cloud vortex at the South Pole , which turns still substantially faster .
The phenomenon reminded of air flows on the terrestrial winter hemisphere , writes a researcher team around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica .
The secondaryinternal planet of the solar system has nearly the same mass as the earth and is nearly just as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers .
Also as tomorrow or evening star marked planet circles in scarcely 225 days around the sun .
It turns however many more slowly around itself : A Venustag takes 243 ground connection days .
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly of the earth reminds , scientists assume both planets under completely similar conditions developed .
On both water collected , which remained on earth in oceans , on which Venus however into space was lost .
And during carbon dioxide on earth , constitutes it is fixed in carbonate rocks on the Venus the majority of the atmosphere .

Pain of the labour party
Gordon Brown discovered still another further pit for falling ; its way from this remains the same one .
For British scandals this is not particularly slippery .
No titles of nobility seem to have been sold , have been paid no politician Paris hotel bills , gelutscht no except-conjugal toes .
But uncovering that enrich businessman donations for the British governing labour a party over more than 650,000 Pound ( 1,3 million dollar ) over four years under the name of other people masked , and that the party missed to announce this is something without that contested Gordon Brown well expenditure-come would be .
When two months ago ago the Prime Minister had extracted itself from the demand after a choice , in daemliche way the intelligence of the British insulting , by maintaining that public opinion polls would not have affected this decision , gave it hope that he would offer a durable , efficient government .
Instead , like Vince Cable , which expressed increasingly astute agency chairmen that liberally democrat , it , the once which was afraid Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean developed .
The awkward rescue a bank fastened by Northern skirt , showed regulatorische weakness and bad faculty of judgement under bombardment .
Badly thought out suggestions on the change of the tax laws enterprise federations against the government applied .
The taxofficial loss of personal data of 25 million humans pointed inconceivable administrative Pfuschereien out .
A Trio of generals in the retirement started a rebellion in the upper house from protest against shortening of military expenditure : Ministers of the armed forces to be , then maintained them , are a partial time job .
Now there are the various donations of David Abrahams ; Peter Watt , Labours Secretary-General ( and their former fulfilment leader ) already withdrew .
Nothing of the fact means that Brown retires irrevocablly direction breaks open .
Governments can reach a turning point , after them it nevertheless not possibly feel to govern .
Neither nor humans may trust politicians , but normally hold back them their skepticism , if a new troop seizes the office .
If it is clear that it is improbable that a prime minister improves the situation , and it does not even need for a long time thereby to be , is this delay past : the public service begins to become leaky ; the cabinet Ministers begin too plaudern ; the press looks for bad messages ; and the government becomes defensive and aimless .
In a way the position of Brown is particularly difficult , because it can not state contrary to other political leaders , to be a new broom .
So gladly he would deny Tony Blair , was he its first lieutenant .
The problems with Northern skirt and the tax competence documents , for example , hang together with decisions , which Brown made as a chancellor of the Treasury .
And even if that were not directly involved in Blairs of misfortunes - how with the long `` money for Adelstitel '' investigation of political party financing - the voters possibly assume it was it .
Nevertheless Browns situation is not completely so bad , as she looks
The misdemeanours are not so terrible , as the conservative ones describe them .
As is the case for Mr. Bean , nobody died , or completely one beschwindelt .
And the remedy , like it to be painful likes , is to be delivered , what Browns naturally stalinistische tendencies to have always promised : A reliable , solidly and easily brutal government .
The new Getue around political donations is a good example .
The garboeske Abrahams , which compares its donations with its non-profit gifts , does not say he wishes public acknowledgment for his sympathetic consideration .
That may be perhaps like that , but the decision over it was not entitled to him .
The laws against anonymity for large political contribution payers are clear and them exist for a clear reason : the public has to know a right to it , who can buy entrance to those , which govern the country .
Watt , which says he would have of Abrahams agreement known , but not that she is illegal , naturally some questions it will have itself to place ; exactly like Jon Mendlesohn , Labours main financial A driver , to which about the strange donations in October one told .
But so far Brown is not involved : There is nothing that on the fact it points that he knew from these confusion , although the largest part of the payments was made after his taking office in June .
So far the prime minister settled half of the work .
He condemned fast the injury of the laws by his party , but he watered this determination by reaching for a well-known instrument , a committee of inquiry to the topic - led , in order to make the measure full , from a bishop in the retirement and a judge .
In this case are not very complicated `` from it to pulling teachings '' .
If the law were broken , it is a thing for the police .
Refrained from it there are other things to make the Mr. Brown must , to find how something a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in the public life , that is vacant for six months , and to in front-walk with a thorough reform of political party financing .
That would require bitter pills for a party comrade from the hard liners of the labour with the conservative ones to cooperate and the special financial relationship up with the trade unions to possibly give - such as Mr. Brown .
But it should be conscious some parteiischen facts .
The conservative ones have now a clear guidance in the public opinion polls ; it has to recover two years around voters ; and the only way , as it can reach a victory , is by indisputable honesty and solid authority .

Food debt at European inflation
Principal reason for the rise of the inflation measured in the euro zone are the rapidly rising food prices .
In the 13 countries of the euro zone the price increase was higher in November than expected - after the 2,6 per cent in October an annual inflation rate was registered by 3.1 per cent , how the statistic office of the European Union in Luxembourg reports .
Official prognoses proceeded from only 3 per cent , announced Bloomberg .
In contrast to the American , British , and Canadian issuing bank the European central bank ( EZB ) did not lower the Leitzsins . After their discretion the rising rohstoffpreise and the easy decrease of unemployment the emergence of an inflationary spiral would favour the reduction of the rate of interest .
The EZB is anxious , the inflation rate under two per cent to keep at least scarce or at the two-per cent mark .
According to an analyst be the EZB in the dilemma : One must `` agree upon '' the inflation , in order to exclude later action need .
With 3,3 per cent the inflation rate reached a twelve-yearly record high in November in Germany ; in Spain climbed the rate of 3,6 to 4,1 per cent .
For the rise of the inflation in the euro zone the risen food and energy price are responsible .
The MATIF Weizennotierungen rose by 88 per cent , and the course for soy beans reached likewise a record high since 1973 .
Also with food oil and milk products there was a substantial price increase in 2007 .
The world price for crude oil rose in this year by 52 per cent - in the past month the cost per barrel of the black gold reached almost 100 US dollar .
According to the EZB the inflation will rise in the year 2008 of 2,1 to 2,5 per cent , however one counts 2009 on a decrease on 1,9 per cent .
For the coming 3-4 months analysts proceed from a 3-Prozent-Inflationsrate , number the annual average rate however with 2,1 per cent .
For 2008 experts count on the fact that the EZB will twice lower the interest .

The harmonized consumer price index ( VPI ) rose in November around five tenths and is now about 4,1 % .
The indicator , which serves euro act for the evaluation of the inflation rate within the European union , supplies the average price history taken place in Spain in November .
Its publication corresponds to the principles of euro act and the European central bank ( EZB ) , which aim at a local and a value comparison by the publication of the data to US products .
The prognosis for the indicator can be provided prematurely , by using the same proceeding as with the harmonized consumer price index , but at the same time still various other statistic modelling methods uses , in order to measure at the time of the computation the missing information .
The Spanish office for statistics ( INE ) reminded however the fact that the prematurely determined indicator serves only as appoximate value and therefore with the final result , which is communicated on coming 14 December , not to agree must .
`` the consumer price index ( VPI ) will remain further on a relatively high level ''
According to statement of the deputy head of the government and economic and the Minister of Finance Pedro Solbes , the rise of the VPI is in November a `` temporary development '' ; at the same time this insured that the price index would remain in the coming months further on a `` relatively high '' level .
Solbes determined nevertheless into resounding the congress building that `` even if the current number is not good '' , the inflation difference of Spain to the other members of the monetary union in the last years `` more or less '' had remained alike .
In addition it explained that there were `` fewer surprises '' in November than in the preceding month , at which the government did not count on such a high rise .
`` we expected a value of approximately 4 % '' , communicated the Minister of Finance and economic regarding the prognosis published today .

National debt becomes in the year 2009 high-fast on one trillion
To each Czech a national debt of 84000 crowns is allotted .
The joint and several debt rose to at the end of of Septembers to 842.7 billion crowns .
The government had planned to be to blame for itself this year with 159.2 billion Konen .
At the beginning of of Decembers reduced the Ministry owing to the better development of the national striking stop politics the plan however to 152.8 billion .
The national debt of the Czech republic rose to at the end of of Septembers to 842.7 billion crowns .
Within the first nine months of this yearly they rose therefore by 40.2 billion .
Since June they sank however by 13.4 billion .
The Treasury confirmed thereby its data concerning the national debt of at the beginning of October .
To each Czech a debt of 84000 crowns is allotted .
Over the entire past year the state was to blame for itself around more than 111 Miliarden crowns .
`` up to now it seems that we will possibly only exceed the border of one trillion crowns owing to the lower deficit for the coming year in the year 2009 .
Next year the debts between 900 billion and one trillion crowns should move , `` said David Marek , analyst of the Patria Finance , the server iHNed.cz .
It sees NEXT Finance similar to Vladimír Pikora , analyst that : `` to the excess of one trillion we could come in the course of the yearly 2009 .
When exact , depends on the next household , which we not yet .
If it should show up that the situation on the political stage changes , and the politicians should to be ready more save , could last up to the year 2010 .
But of such a change I do not go out , `` noticed he .
Debts grow
The national debt is due to the debts of the state government and comes particularly from the accumulation of deficits of the national budget .
The national debt financed by treasury bonds , national debenture bonds , direct loans or for example by loans of the European investitionsbank .
The domestic national indebtedness rose this year meanwhile to 719.4 billion crowns .
The foreign debts of the state rose meanwhile by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion .
The so-called marketable national debt reached at the end of of September 803.3 billion crowns and sank since June by 13.7 billion .
The average maturity of the national debt rose to 6.5 years .
`` the joint and several debt rose over the year from first to the third quarter by 13 per cent , which really much is in view of its , as well the economy is .
It is interesting that increasing is to be registered particularly with the debenture bonds , where the increase amounts to 20 per cent .
It is bad that the debts rise , but on the other hand shows this that one can something undertake , already before the pension reform comes , `` commentated Pikora the data .
Better than expects
From the financing strategy and handling the national debt for 2007 it follows that the government had planned for this year to take up 159.2 billion crowns .
At the beginning of of Decembers reduced the Ministry owing to the better development of the national striking stop politics the plan however to 152.8 billion crowns .
This amount is due particularly to the national budgetary deficit , which will reach this year obviously 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion .
It continues to concern around maximally taken into account means for the consolidation agency at a value of 13.3 billion crowns , a ten-billion-reserve for the payment of the pensions , the financing of treasury bonds for 43 billion and rates for the loans with the European investitionsbank at a value of 1.8 billion .

Delicate information
The entrance of the historians to bath Arolsen it to make possible to operate investigations `` particularly about the Deportationen of prisoners , the passengers of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers '' , explains Reto masters , directors/conductors of these archives , which are administered by the international committee of the red cross ( CICR ) .
Until recently still several states , also Germany were to make these named-referred documents for the public accessible due to the delicate character of certain information .
As for example the alleged Homosexualitaet or the mental handicap of some Deportationsopfer .
The passenger lists of the concentration camps or of the Gestapo of issued warrants of arrest had been gathered after the war for a practical reason : To civilians to possibly supply with , who deportiert or which hard labour had been subordinated to find and them an evidence of their arrest , in order to smooth for them so the way to their remuneration .
Still today Arolsen work on more than 300 established ones of ten thousands of personal inquiries in bath .
Nevertheless , a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in the entrance to bath Arolsen .

`` it is unfortunate that the parties could come to no agreement over the status '' , explained the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger with a press conference into Vienna .
With stress on it that the peace in the region on the play are located , it requested its American counterpart franc Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina to follow its obligations for the receipt of the peace and the discussions also beyond the end of the negotiations to continue .

End of the switchings on 10 December
The mediators of the troika , which will meet the European one union , which unites the USA and Russia in itself , on Monday a last mark in Serbia and in the Kosovo .
The future of the province inhabited to 90 % of Albanian speaking could become clearer , if Ischinger , Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane Khartchenko by 10 December its report at the uncertainty advice to submit .
The discussions of bathing , in which proximity of Vienna , formed sixth and last negotiation meeting since the troika August passed from the UN the order to a new switching had received .
Americans and Europeans count on the fact that their order for switching will end on 10 December .
The Russians , who had already blocked the grant of the independence of the Kosovo at the security council , insist on a continuation of the negotiations beyond this final date .
`` Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution , a concerted solution '' , said Botsane Khartchenko .
One-sided declaration of independence ?
After the Kosovo confessed eight years long under administration of the UN , the western countries regard independence under supervision by the European Union as the only solution with future .
Pristina shows up ready to announce these one-sided if the security council should not decide to their favour .
Belgrade insists on stronger autonomy

Six deterring little things , in order to annoy teammates
Enamel , which we forget to send , to language messages , which we never receive - harmless lies , which are not noticeable to us any longer : They bring `` color '' into the everyday life on the job .
The question is bare , whether one gets accustomed to these small incommodities , or places themselves one better to the challenge and tries these misleading to vermweiden for other annoying situations consciously .
Tipps .
`` Sorry , I has forgets you to align that someone from the marketing department called '' - a colleague says .
That one missed thereby a meeting ?
One regrets it at best and tries it again to good-close perhaps , by calling at the marketing department and confessing reumuetig , one would have forgotten to align the message ( that is the less usual method ) .
The thing with an apology is dismissed mostly .
Before one involves oneself into embarrassing excuses , one should consider , with which one can to prepare and try its colleague indeed unpleasant moments to avoid these situations consciously .
Something lent , which does not belong to one ?
There are hardly something Nervigeres , as if one after a document , office supply , or the telephone seizes , not there but it is .
Yesterday did the booklet equipment still lie on the desk - this morning is it away ?
Or lost believed ball-point pens for instance on the desk of a colleague discovered ?
Without to ask one should not itself anything of the colleagues check-out counters , because they are by right annoyed , if they state that somewhat got away .
Thus , no covers or post office its from the office into the bag put , because it could meet one : keins more there , if man 's nevertheless urgently needs .
GET ratchet over the private life of the colleagues ?
There is no effective means to stop a gossip , which was already set into the world .
Who with whom , which made ?
Where and why ?
One should not bind the information ( or assumptions ) over the private life of the colleagues after possibility for everyone to the nose !
And if someone opens and tells us its internal secret nevertheless , we should not abuse this confidence !
Best one is silent like a grave , instead of aligning straight the not present one , even if others know about the problems of the colleague also .
Without reason ill announced ?
If one calls in the office , in order to announce itself with reference to tormenting headache ill , because one feels straight uneasy , or to simply only rest itself , should one would like to realize oneself over one : Now the colleagues must settle the own work , urgent completions , projects with firm dates instead of one .
The colleague thus badly do not along-play !
If one already knows at the vortag that one will not create it on the next day in the office , or that somewhat interfere could , why one must remain at home , should one it in time announce , so that neither the colleagues , still the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence .
Gesumme , Gekicher , telephoning
One is deepened straight in its work , by the loud Gekicher of the colleagues is however suddenly disturbed ?
Inadvertently a telephone call belongs , which one should not have heard better ?
One should not the colleagues with sums , singing , loud discussions ( which one leads across its heads away ) , Getrampel , continuing grumbling or Noergeln nerves .
All this can be disturbing much , even if they are not deepened straight in a task ( write , plan , organize ) .
Is the other debt always ?
If a project is finished not within the prescribed period , one has an important letter or important realigns forgotten to send , should not look for one the debt of the own forgetfulness not with others !
After possibility one should not dissuade oneself from on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues !
Best one confesses oneself its to error , and apologizes , if others were affected also by it !
The question , how one good-makes the error again , or which missed retrieve can , is only too appropriate !
In the office - a feeling like at home ?
Training trousers and Schlapfen : Comfortably for at home , however in the office nothing lost !
Not even then one should dress so casual , if it would actually permit the job !
Only not too schlampig will - one should respect oneself both its colleagues , and so far that one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired , also prettily and elegantly !

Fraudulent broker risked billions because of inferiority feelings
Soil-loose cheat
Thus Jerome Kerviel the French bank giant Société Générale , owner of the local Komer ? ní designates its former employee banka .
She came because of him around nearly five billion euro .
It seems however rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a large player , who wanted to do it equal its colleagues beyond that surely not was unable .
To the difference to all large banking houses it recognized in time the crisis by amerikanischenn the mortgage market .
`` it is psychologically rather weak , '' was from the mouth of its superiors to be heard , who indicated it at the police .
Like however from the statements Kerviels , which published the French media , for example the daily paper Le of moons , was it comes out humans , the end of last yearly with its business of profits at a value of 1.6 billion euro had obtained .
Crisis not only in America
`` everything that I wanted , was to be earned for my bank money , '' states it in its statement .
In the summer he had succeeded in earning straight at the American crisis a half billion euro .
The opportunity in addition it had already erspaeht at the yearly beginning .
In February gave it already first messages over that so-called Sub Prime sub-Prime-Hypotheken , how they are given income-weak customers or such , who had already in former times payment by instalments problems , in difficulties were guessed .
Influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis however .
Kerviel believed that not and kept right .
At the year end it had raised its profit up to 1.6 billion euro .
`` as I had already earned the first half billion , did not know I not , as I that to be explained should , '' admit Kerviel and continue to say that he had kept definitely nothing for itself .
During the whole verhoers it admits that it falsified documents , so that one would not come it on the schliche .
It succeeded to it even to lead its bosses behind the light even if gradually the Eurex stock exchange were interested in its business .
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up ?
Probably hardly .
`` I thought that she satisfies the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank . ''
From where did it take the courage to risk so much ?
He had to gain its position gradually .
The Société Générale it occurred in the year 2000 , after it had directly terminated its study at the University of Lyon .
Its annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollar .
After two years he was an assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 already became he an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollar .
He knew nevertheless that he will earn never as much as others .
`` with my first discussion in the year 2005 I already knew that one observed me .
Because of my training and also because of my vocational and personal development , `` Kerviel explained the investigation official .
But already soon after its entrance first large success came .
With the shares of the alliance he earned much , by setting a half billion euro with the Londoner bomb attacks on kursverluste of this title .
And that was the trip - now he wanted more .
Solang you profit makes , leaves we you
`` that is like a schneeball , '' said it the policemen .
But the bosses knew allegedly from everything , and/or suspected it .
`` I money earned , closed one the eyes so long . ''
But then this yearly the large impact came at the beginning .
On only one day it lost a billion euro .
On one weekend in the middle of January wanted it to adjust .
When he came on Monday to the work , already was he no more employees of the bank .
And a few days the bank announced later that it had lost because of him five billion euro .
And how did they come it on the schliche ?
It made itself suspicious by one vacation .
`` I took only four days from the previous year .
A broker , who does not take vacation , is one , which does not want that one looks him into the maps , `` said Kerviel finally .

Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exact , so that the practice of making new arrangements the working days was meanwhile established approximately around the holidays , however give to us the coming year less such days .
Also in the European Union and in America one understands something else by `` holiday '' .
The Hungarian juridical system differentiates between state holidays and work-free days .
Work-free days are mostly church holidays , or stand with important historical events in connection .
We celebrate New Year for example also : Both the last day of the old , and the first day of the new yearly are work-free days - thereby the latter alone the Silvester celebrating to rest itself can do .
In the whole year we have altogether fourteen holidays .
The state holidays are 15 March , which reminds of the revolution of 1848 , and which 23 October , the anniversary of the revolution of 1956 .
On 20 August the establishment of state , on 1 May the work , is celebrated on 1 and 2 November thinks of we our dead ones .
Beyond that there are ever two holidays to Easter , Whitsuntide , and Christmas .
Since our state - , national or religious holidays on one weekend fall rarely , the practice of the `` working day shift '' worked satisfactorily in the cases , in which we would work before or after the holiday only one day .
The price of the extended weekends is however the fact that we very probably work on Saturdays before it or into the school to go must .
When this day , which falls before or after the holiday , is to be processed finally is specified , since long years by the employment minister in its own regulation .
The legislation applies to all employers and takers , to public employees and officials of the public service equally .
Excluded are only companies and mechanisms , in which the enterprise without interruption , thus also at the holidays , is continued .
This year working rules is only brought somewhat in disorder by the holidays at the year end : Starting from 24 December the life in this country stops formally , since most for the days between Christmas and Silvester time reconciliation , or which particularly for it waived vacation take .
In the next year fall more holidays into the week center , and/or on the end of the week , so that it will give fewer changes of plans at the working days , than this year .
The calendar is placed first approximately around the day of the work `` on the head '' , so that humans can remain equal four days at the piece at home .
Saturday , which will be 26 April one working day , thereby Friday , 2 May one quiescent day can .
The second change of plans is connected with the holiday on 23 October : On Saturday , which 18 October one will process Friday , 24 October first must .
The end of the yearly will be located however completely in the indication of the holidays , after starting from 24 December everything remains lying and standing , even if Silvester on one Wednesday falls .

The strain of the candidates unloads itself already with the first topic .

This counters for his part with heavy reproaches : `` I to say , its own house was a port for illegal ones '' , answers Giuliani and accuses to that former governor von Massachusetts privately immigrants without papers to have employed .
The candidates blow to the attack : Because the republican basis has further no clear favorite , the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all , in order to discredit their adversaries .
The turned 30-Sekunden-Videos , which sent InterNet users in via Youtube , is hardly more than reference givers .
`` with this kind of isolationism we let Hitler come to power '' , accuse John McCain its contractor Ron Paul , who only demands as a departure from the Iraq , immediate in the round .
Also Romney gets of Viet Nam veterans strongly the Leviten read , when he refuses itself , who `` Waterboarding so mentioned '' , a methodmethod method , with which drowning is simulated , condemning as torture .
The fact that the important topics of the campaign lie in the meantime however beyond from Iraq war and torture debates shows the reactions of the hall public in pc . Petersburg in Florida .
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected , applause breaks up in the auditory .
Shows up once more , where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie .
`` I erred at that time '' , explain Romney zerknirscht and carry out before basis and television public for the fact apology that he belonged to 1994 still to the abortion proponents .
Giuliani however comes into the roll , when he is asked according to his opinion for the literal interpretation of the Bible .

The problem arose on Wednesday , when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery , a large cylindric part , which was to take up soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories .
This module is a kind jetty for the module laboratories .
But one must be able to supply it with river .
The second task of the crew was it thus to convert 17.5 tons a heavy module for generation of current over solar collectors , which already on EAT YOURSELF found , in order to bring it into its final position .
After it had shifted it , the crew made itself to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module , whose span amounts to 76 meters .
And it happened that one of the collectors , which can be unfolded like Akkordeone was damaged by a gotten jammed cable on a length by approximately a meter
The restructuring was stopped , in order not to damage the collector still more .
The astronauts , who should repair the space shuttle Discovery originally for a kontrollgang abandoned and then another solar collector , whose rotation system was incorrect , saw themselves forced to dedicate itself to the damaged collector .
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk at the end of the 30 meters long remote controlled arm of the space shuttle , which at that the station one had attached , around in order the repair to accomplish .
It is one the best `` Spacewalker '' ( Wetraumgaenger ) of NASA .
Largely , resistantly , very skillfully , he has a well developed torso and long arms .
The 46-jaehirige learned physician was thus selected , whom `` hurt '' solar collector `` operate '' .
After it had examined the damage exactly , it split the incorrect cable and fastened a kind rails on the damaged place .
It was supported by a second `` Spacewalker '' , which remained in the proximity of the air-lock , and , from inside , by the other astronauts , among them Peggy Whitson , Kommandantin of the crew .
The tool , which it used , a mini hockey stick , with insulator tapes , in order to prevent on the solar collectors , which produce several hundred V , an electrical impact , had the astronauts on board the station devised and `` tinkered '' .
When the action was terminated , Scott Parazynski waited , until the collector was completely unfolded , before it counted and into the station back turned its tools .
Yesterday the astronauts enjoyed afternoon a half day relaxation , before today seven astronauts turned Discovery on the space shuttle back , in order to presumably begin Wednesday the return flight to the earth .

From Beust criticism for olympia refusal harvests
Moving of the mayor away from the application of Hamburg for olympic summer games is encountered with politics and economics violent criticism .
Many want to fight further for the plays at the water .
But of Beust realism reminds on during the estimate of the chances .
The managing director of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg , Hans Hans-Joerg Schmidt Trenz , called on Wednesday a renouncement `` not well for the economic situation '' .
No other project unfolded as large motivation forces in the city in recent time as the olympia idea .
`` without this goal the sport-political momentum could be maintained not equally . ''
Schmidt Trenz requested the senate not to bury the project but proceeds a new long-term beginning for it to find , `` from a changed time jet '' .
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements , according to which the olympia ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least up to the year 2028 .
`` Hamburg does not decide on an olympia application , but the German olympic sport federation '' , said WORLD ON-LINE ONE of Beust .
It referred Decembers to for at the beginning of the resolution of the sport federation expected over an application of Munich for the winter plays 2018 .
`` this preference means for us that we will not have realistic chances in the period to 2028 , angedachten so far by us . ''
The dream is expenditure-dreamed nevertheless not for all time , said of Beust .
That Hamburg sport federation ( HSB ) regretted the statements of Beusts .
Thus the impression one arouse that Hamburg does not want to apply in the next 25 years no more for olympic plays .
`` it is too early to block itself a chance by saying the plans already at this time buried '' , to HSB president Guenter Ploss on Wednesday .
A renouncement of the application contradicts besides for the statement of the senate boss on the occasion of a receipt the plenary assembly of the general German university sport federation .
There from Beust the application of Hamburg for the Universiade did not designate 2015 `` as replacement '' for olympic plays in Hamburg .
The university sport federation had only nominated Hamburg in the past week as applicant city .
The SPD citizenry parliamentary group accused to the senate valuable time for housebuilding in Hamburg to have used .
`` the development of the small Grasbrooks was for many years retarded by the senate , because it set the SPD delegates Carola Veit and January quast on the map Olympia and excluded , said housebuilding '' .
While the SPD for the small Grasbrook always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residential use , the CDU set on one side on the `` Event factor '' .
The application for the olympic summer games 2012 had caused a large enthusiasm at that time in Hamburg .
Hamburg had failed however because of Leipzig .

Test Peugeot 207 SW 1,6 VTi : Voruteile shrink
In order to say the truth , I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206 .
Its handling characteristics were not much worth , the quality of the gear shift , the steering element and also the processing could one as rather designate below average .
But its successor , the Peugeot 207 , is now on the market , and that is better around much .
The combination with the designation SW is still another piece further , and for me remains only to revise my opinion .
When I had tested the classical Hatchback 207 , I had to deplore myself for example over the too small head liberty on the rear seats .
There are not these complaints now any longer , because the body combination is in such a way arranged that two-meter men will not even suffer .
Fast further
I go through the interior equipment only briefly , in order not to repeat me too much .
Concerns a Design quite succeeded , where I have objections only because of the miserable frame tunnel .
There I would welcome somewhat more designerische organization , where the car makes otherwise a so elegant impression .
The seats are comfortable , and past are the times , where we possibly weighted about to short seats or head restraints .
Also the side stop improved opposite that 206 substantially .
Which concerns the space offer , one can feel the increased dimensions of the body also here .
In the combination also the lack of head liberty , already mentioned , is eliminated .
Suit-case into the trunk
The main thing at this car is however the loading space .
I ( also because of the opening by hinges rueckfensters ) must call that very good loadable and space-saving .
The cavities are equipped with straps , which represent an ideal compromise .
They disturb not , can be pulled apart and held also heavier articles firmly .
But we converse about the load volume .
It amounts to according to table in the basic equipment 428 litres , which in the comparison to the competition a rather average value is .
However not in the comparison to the vehicle of this class ? koda the Fabia combi usually-sold in Tschechien .
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav , we state that the Peugeot stays around clearly noticeable 52 litres .
For one foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical .
But around the Positiva to emphasize , I must mention still the loading space completely flat after turning the rear seats down or also the very low ladekante .
120 HP in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with capacity of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 KW .
And honestly said , then a 1600-Kubik-Motor should look , which propels a family Hatchback .
It is quiet , has a small consumption and moves away well .
If I compare it with its counterpart with ? koda , which sometimes works , as if its exhaust with a rag would be clogged , then I can be only inspired by it .
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not popular straight .
We must remember however that we tested a well equipped car with a roomy Innneren and a very good engine .
The basic price of the car with the 1400er petrol engine at a value of 329900 crowns still concerns .
With our engine it costs starting from 410900 crowns , which already quite much is .
The equipment Premium of the test car strikes again with 80000 crowns additionally to beech .
We had however Kopfairbags , automatic air conditioning system , automatic windshield wiper release , electrical window lifters in the back and and ...
Thus the car costs altogether smooths 531900 crowns .
That is a quantity , but sums up you once the zusatzausstattung of a Fabia and you with a completely similar sum will arrive .
Thus remains only the decision , which mark one wants to select .

Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year-old detention for Expraesidenten
An industrial tribunal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year-old detention for the former president Arnold Alemán on Thursday , to which it had been condemned 2003 because of finance fraud at a value of 100 million dollar ( almost 1.8 billion crowns ) .
However it was later from the prison dismisses and lived under house arrest on its Hazienda with the nicaruanischen metropolis .
Whether the former head of state ( 1997 to 2002 ) of this Central American state comes again behind lattices , is at present unclear according to the press agency AP .
The chairmen of the industrial tribunal , Ileana Pérez , according to it will depend now on the detention officials whether one lets Alemán its punishment serve at home , or whether it must in the prison .
A court proved before four years that Alemán had shifted regularly money of the government on accounts of foreign companies in Panama .
These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in reality to its related and closest trailers .
Some of this money finally landed in a fund , which Alemán had furnished for the financing of its election campaign 2001 .

The fathers herb skirt return
Of Germany super+ 's group of the seventies makes music again : The three volume members of Harmonia again planned their consoles with a concert in Berlin .
To the Revival a Mitschnitt appears from their large time `` Live one 1974 '' .
They were substantially more famous abroad already at that time .
The fixed sensation occurs then in shape of three set gentlemen at the evening board .
Everyone has its small box before itself , its cables and above all its buttons .
Dieter Moebius thront in the bloom-white shirt with 63 years in the center .
Left flanks from Michael red ago , 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar .
Right , regarded from the auditory , Hans Joachim Roedelius , curves 73 , concentrated at the console .
Everyone contributes noises , every now and then even a Beat .
And sometimes it adds itself inadvertently to a conventional piece of music .
That does not seem to disturb then also the gentlemen themselves largely .
The fact that the volume Harmonia makes music again provided among herb skirt lovers for some excitement .
Whereby one may reveal here : Purposeful demands resulted in that the name did not schwirrte by the collective Popgedaechtnis , but by any means so lastingly , in order to miss this volume for 32 years painfully .
But why not also the German is to be allowed to celebrate its living legends from the seventies-years ?
Particularly since what misleading herb skirt is called , was considered in England and America always more than in the own country .
When the music economy lent the survivor of the Cologne group of CAN 2003 the echo price for the life 's work , one saw in the hall into asking German Popgesichter .
As also still talk yourself Hot Chili Peppers in the Laudatio with volume the La Duesseldorf and Neu ! thanked you , knew the surprise no borders .
With concerts Michael squatted with talks red ago later Hot Chili Peppers on the stage like an old buddy .
The problem of the Ignoranz at home and the clarifying in the foreigner is one .
The memory is already overtaxed with Harmonia , because the Trio existed only two years and in this time also a far smaller effect power unfolded than them of others was later assigned .
Moebius and Roedelius had made music to many promising name cluster already before with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under that .
First one played in the cellar under the citizens of Berlin stagestage stage .
Afterwards in Duesseldorf , for economic reasons for a disk label maintained by the church .
With power station had helped out briefly red ago and itself afterwards as a guitarist with new ! , the at that time perhaps most radical German group , a call erspielt .
Around 1973 followed red ago however the cluster musi edges in the exile after forest in the Weser mountain country .
There , in the old person Weser yard , a ruin from that 16. , they lived century as city-volatile Kommunarden .
Less ideologically than in the municipality I , where Roedelius could have trouble still as child girls .
Rather in pointed-awayful artist existence .
Also a wimpel of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein was alleged and for the art a name in the check garbage .
Some held Harmonia of it .
The first album was called `` music of Harmonia '' and following `` De Luxe '' .
Because so left and modestly the music also sounded , the volume suffered material emergency .
The brushwood collecting did not serve alone the self identification .
The CD `` Live ones appeared now 1974 '' with a concert in Griessem , before one scarcely 50-koepfigen record background was along-cut , as someone believes to remember itself .
From red ago at that time the desire came to force and occasionally practice Harmonia .
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand .
The volume explained its separation to 1975 .
Its existence landed red ago with albums like `` flaming hearts '' in the Esoterisch spherical one and secured themselves .
Since that time cluster was animated in the Achtzigern again and is more successful , than it was Harmonia ever .
The Griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert Groenemeyer .
Its disk company Greenland sat down it to the goal of maintaining the herb skirt as characteristic German contribution to the alive music .
Again ! thereby like Roedelius solo work was already excavated .
The physical reon purchasing of Harmonia takes place in the citizen of Berlin house of the cultures of the world .
Publicly , in the context of the festival Woldtronics subsidizes .
Julian Cope is there , the Britisher , Altpunk and author of the manual `` herb skirt Sampler '' .
There also the Loveparade inventor is Dr. Motte .
With which the entire range of the influences of the herb skirt on the following Popmusik would be outlined .
Thereby the blank character of the super+ 's group is filled out by Harmonia .
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar sounds in the hall : `` those only true music , it belongs the future . ''
There are pictures , which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmer room .
The putting formation projections of further black-and-white photos of confused verkabelten geraetschaften serve .
Before it are again with the improvisation concerned three veterans .
No more , by sticking microphones on the organ and on the schlagzeug , in order to draw from the instruments over tinkered effect devices outrageous tones .
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music .
Three in the technical deepened Tueftler .
In it also the choir of the house does not change anything .
Under the line Barbara of morning star under sound clouds one coughs and one gewispert and in a beautiful place with Emphase `` Aaaaaaaah ! '' sung .
Herb skirt was always a very English term .
It never concerned skirt .
The roots were looked for less in the Blues , than in colleges of music ( CAN ) , technologies ( power station ) or on the escape before artistic and social conventions ( cluster ) .
Who here `` ' 68 ! '' calls , has not completely wrongly , and Harmonia can not be brought of it still from the peace .
Still the selfmost understandable is thoroughly considered on the stage .
Where does music catch on and when does it stop ?
That can rob the nerves or give volatile moments of large luck .

What is special at this household ?
It is the first household , which this government sketched , and which without support of the opposition by the coalition majority one accepted .
For the current year still with support of the ? SSD ( Social Democrats ) one approved of , because it Minister Sobotka ( of this party ) had submitted , and which could not take the liberty ? SSD it therefore to reject him .
In contrast to the lively debate before the tuning over the motion of no confidence against the government this time nothing dramatic happened .
The Lower House approved of this traditionally little considered , nevertheless most important law in all peace .
That is to a certain extent paradoxical .
All governing begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household whether pleases or not .
The household is a substantial component of the policy , however covered by the struggle for power of the government and the opposition .
That is for the media a more grateful topic , and therefore they dedicate more attention to him .
A controversy among politicians is many more interesting for the public than sober numbers .
The national budgets suffered at the past social-democratic governments under three weak points , which the household can eliminate for the year 2008 not at one time :
First is the high portion of expenditures , which are because of obligating of law , whereby it does not only concern the pensions , but also around social expenditures , which the `` tacit '' coalition of ? SSD and KS ? M ( communist ) decided in the last year before the elections .
Second is the defizitaere budgetary policy as consequence of the first weak point .
The third restriction exists in the deficits of public finances , i.e . the budgetary deficits of the municipalities .
The largest risk is not however the national budgetary deficit .
This household is public and eingermassen under control .
A true time bomb is however the budgetary deficit of the municipalities .
Many mayors spent , in order to open except incomes from taxes , deliveries and bank credits further sources on investments , often inconsiderately debenture bonds , by which they were to blame for their city halls in the oversize .
In the last years it succeeded to them , these debts by massive sales of shares of the energy and of different supply networks , which had received it in the course of the privatisation from the state to pay off .
Now is this source already triumphs .
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts , we state that :
our economics already for some years , how the remainder of the world goes through , a growth phase , whose the ? SSD without omit yourself praises .
That represented a unique possibility for its governments of bringing public finances in order .
Instead these governments were to blame for the state however still more .
Other countries , apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary , Albania , Pakistan or Egypt , kept house many more reasonably than our republic .
That is a giant dishonor , which is to be attributed predominantly to the former governments .
We belong to the countries , those , in the global yardstick seen , to few by poverty are threatened .
Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary , which redundant-proves unfortunately straight completely in the last years in gigantic extent was blown up .
Even if succeeded , a part of the unreasonable populist expenditures , which were adopted this year before the elections , to paint , is clearly that if it does not come in next time to a shift of the pension entrance age and to a pension reform will remain , then ends practically any politics in this country , and , equal to who in power is whole , for it nothing as pure administration .
It is only easily exaggerated , if one says that then from dominant politicians officials become , who divide the largest part of the tax receipts mechanically on pensions and social expenditures .
Therefore the household of this year can no revolution be , but can only to the displacement of normal expenditures by expenditures for obligation stop order .
The deficit of 70 billion crowns , planned for 2008 , would be quite redundant , if former governments had not spent in the last ten years , which only went .
If we do not want that it comes really to the fact that from dominant politicians pure civil servants become , then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government , that is aware however of its that the state can spend only so much , as it is at taxes and fees to take able peace during the preparation of further reform laws to wish .
Only these make possible a gradual penetration of a balanced national budget .

Let propaganda published such type be almost free in comparison with conventional television advertising , so defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC , to be sure these videos carry always a certain measure at political message in itself because they confirm the existence authorization of the measures concluded military by the government in own manner .
Americans advertise with game
The army must fight however also against amateur reception , must create that it next to the carefully processed , zensurierten receptions also into the network - like about such , that show the death of the soldiers : In that something propaganda film hypocritical , `` official '' is spoken over the losses at most , are not shown the bloody sides of the war however .

In the empire of Angela cloud
The unrealistic entrance of the chancellor documents that the coalition is in substance at the end - and that of its even is nothing to be expected more .
In which country does this Federal Chancellor live actually ?
After its desolate entrance in the general debate of the Bundestag , that was wurschtig and contents poor , one must say : not here - not in the country , that finally would have to be reigned of its .
The accusation that she would concentrate too very on the foreign policy , rejected Angela Merkel with a badly presumptuous sentence .
Let that be provincial , said it and showed therewith first that it does not want to grasp , about what it goes the critics .

There neither concrete interest nor quite a feeling was to be sensed for the problems in the country .
Instead Angela cloud presented itself : a removed politician who escapes into the foreign policy and remains even there in the approximate .
Example climate protection : There she praises herself unimpeded for the decisions of holy dam , says however not how in this country the climate goals are supposed to be reached .
Generally , the even praise - so much Unbescheidenheit the Christian Democratic Union-boss would have failed herself yet two years ago .
Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing would arrive at the persons .
Therewith it damages its image as a pragmatist , who solves problems , instead of the world beautiful speech .
But in the empire of Angela cloud , domestic problems are an edge appearance .
Child poverty and the worries of the low earners ?
A couple of subordinate clauses has it for that over .
At the same time is designating how often she promises herself , when it concerns the child extra charge .
Merkel needs three starts there in order to bring out a half-way straight sentence .
It stumbles like on strange grounds if it becomes concrete .

That it gave a Teddybären a name , was shown it today a court in Khartum .
According to its lawyer , the British teacher , who had been accused in the Sudan because of offense of the Islams , was convicted , on Thursday evening of a court in Khartum to 15 days custody and subsequent from direction .
The Briton was accused to have permitted six-year until seven year old students , to give a Teddybären the name Mahomet although each representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited .
It would have earned it to be flogged .
After parents of students had burdened themselves repeatedly in the Sudanese ministry of education and cultural affairs , became the 54-year-old elementary school teacher , that was active at the Unity High School of Khartum , on Sunday with itself at home taken up and accuses after articles 125 of the Sudanese punishment code of the offense the Islams .
Actually this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher requests its six-year until seven year old student to choose a name for the Klassenteddy .
Children propose eight names , under that Hassan , Abdullah and reports training leader Robert Boules .
In the end , when the class votes , 20 of 23 children Mohammed select as a dearest first name .
Certainly , Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet , but above all also a first name very frequent in the Sudan .
Subsequently the children generated a book for the class , with which photo of the bear is on that and the picture signature name .
The bear itself carried no sign with this name , but the problem is entirely simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is looked at as an offense of the Islams .
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian gibbons , that instructs at the same school in the Sudan , explained , would know would have done would have he it good , and it never something wherewith it could step a religious belief to nearly , regret itself acts only that it the children asked , for a name to its considering it herewith only around one .
An opinion that numerous students of the teacher divide who never describe this as attentive vis-à-vis its and as that in the class over religion .
Consider that the first name Mohammed of simultaneously also that in Great Britain is at the second most frequent given two name , for which in the English 14 different letter manner exist .
This first name selected often by Moslem families counts as a type Ehrerbietung at the prophet ( it becomes frequently the first-born of a family given ) .
But how do the rules in the reference read on the use of this first name ?
May one give it for example a toy ?
This is obvious a question of the interpretation .

The choice of the status Quo
On Sunday it will not become in the counting of the urns exciting : The mass of the Russians will decide on president Putins party , united Russia .
After a very blocked campaign , it confirms its striving after stability , even after Autoritarismus .
The Russian Präsident Wladimir Putin direct three days before the parliament choices a message radiated on the public transmitters to the voters , who already was recorded to be sure , whose contents is concealed however .
It does this in its characteristic as a leading candidate of the united Russia , who per-Kremlin-party , for which an overpowering victory announces himself .
Yesterday the president has look through let nothing when he received the foreign ambassadors , and gave therewith content to deliver a new attack point against the west powers , that of the interference accused become be himself favorite subject during the campaign .
Know the price of a genuine democracy and hope for joined us honest choices , extremely transparently and openly , choices without it thereto .
From the viewpoint of the opposition , they made a mistake there .
It denounces a campaign stained by suppression .
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says , there would have been such dirty choices , not once at the time of .
After the suppression of the demonstrations at the last weekend , custody applies convicted become was to Ex-Schachweltmeister Garry Kasparovder for prohibited demonstrating to five days , according to its lawyer further visit ban .
Russians the mentalities of the homo have itself Sovieticus
After these parliament choices without tension , two much continuing questions raise themselves :
Who will begin Putins succession as a president ?
The office newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first ballot of the presidency choices , the 2 March 2008 ; the candidates have until 23 December time to make themselves well known .
Because it was selected 2000 and 2004 was re-elected , Wladimir Putin can not begin for a third mandate in consequence .
And now no successor is found .
Which roll will play Putin after March ?
Prime minister ?
Will more presiding of the parliament majority and the almighty party united Russia that government and president select ?
What also always it will be , in the parliament choices or in the presidency choices , that triumph becomes previous power .
That is tradition .
Russians the mentalities of the homo preserved itself Sovieticus , are means it not gentleman its the sociologist Lev Goudkov , director of the independent center Levada .
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the national university Saint Petersburg returns even yet further : The middle class company has only very slowly develop further delayed itself in this country , that became five centuries to Europe christianisiert , ; the famous partnership spirit the development of personality .
After the liberal reforms of the '90er 's Putin attached again to the model of a paternalistischen country , what perfectly was supposed by the population , the more because on this new Paternalismus no terror followed , but rather a certain economic prosperity , means Maria Lipman of the Carnegie-foundation .
Pieces free today the Russians on the personal that it after the ruin of the Ussr short-term at the day put have .
yet long
This phenomenon concerns all company layer , including the business world .
And the administration elite understand it that status Quo to hold : 65 governors ( of 85 Russian region chair ) cite the local choice lists of the united Russia .
The new freedoms coming out of the west are often equivalent with chaos , like in the '90er 's .
The general public prefers stability .
In this sense , the Russians will not agree also for the extremist parties .
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko , a 54-year-old professor : Consider yet long ?
That that are at the power are not so bad why it

Pains of the Labour-party
Gordon Brown discovered another further pit to the Hineinfallen ; its way out of this out the same remains .
For British scandals , this is not especially slippery .
No nobility titles seem pays sold , no politician Parisian hotel calculations to have become no extramarital toes gelutscht .
But the disclosure that a rich businessman has disguises contributions for the British reigning Labour party over more than a 650,000 pounds ( 1.3 million dollar ) over four years under the name of other people , and that the party neglected to report this , is fought over come out would be somewhat without that of that Gordon Brown well .
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn himself from the demand for of a choice , on dämliche type and manner the intelligence of the Britons insulting in that he maintained , that opinion survey would not have influenced this decision , gave it hope that he would offer a robust , efficient government .
Instead , how Vince Cable , the of representation chair shrewd in increasing mass that liberally democrats , it expressed , has itself the once feared Brown by Stalin to Mr. Bean develops .
The awkward rescue of Northern skirt , a marred bank , showed regulatorische weakness and bad judgment done under gunfire .
Badly reasoned have proposals to the change the tax laws business associations against the government raised .
The tax official loss of people-related data of 25 million persons showed unimaginable administrative bungling up .
A trio of generals in the retirement started an uprising in the waiter house out of protest against abridgments of military editions : Ministers of the military forces to be , maintained it , would be a part-time job .
Now it gives already resigned the manifold contributions of David Abrahams ; Peter watt , Labours secretary-general ( and its earlier fulfillment leader ) .
Nothing therefrom means that Brown breaks open irrevocably direction retirement .
Nevertheless governments can reach a turning point to reign impossibly perceive it after that it .
Neither yet like to trust person politicians , but hold it normally its scepticism back if a new troop seizes the office .
If it once clearly is , that it unlikely is , that a prime minister improves the situation , and he yet once long does not need to be there , is this delay past : the public service begins to become leaky ; the cabinet ministers begin to chat ; the press searches for bad messages ; and the government becomes defensive and aimless .
In a manner the position of Brown is especially difficult because it can not maintain in contrast to other political leaders to be a new broom .
So gladly it Tony Blair deny would become , was it its lieutenant .
The problems with Northern skirt and the tax responsibility documents , for example , hang together with decisions , that encountered Brown as a chancellor of the treasury .
And even if that not directly involved was come into Blairs misfortunes - like in the long `` moneys for nobility title '' -investigation from political party financing - the voters possibly therefrom that he were it .
Nevertheless Browns situation is not entirely as bad as it looks
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe it .
How in Mr. Bean , no one died completely was cheated , or .
And the remedy , painfully how it be likes , is to be delivered , what Browns always promised naturally stalinistische tendencies : A dependable , solidly and easily brutal government .
The new Getue around political contributions is a good example .
It says would wish the garboeske Abrahams , that its contributions with its public-spirited gifts compares , no public recognition for its goodwill .
That likes to be perhaps so , but stood the decision about that it not to .
The laws against anonymity for large political contribution payers are clear and it exist for an unambiguous reason : the public is right an on that to know , who reign himself access to which buy can , that the country .
It says would have known watt , that of Abrahams agreement , but not that it is illegal , will have to ask itself obviously some questions ; exactly like Jon Mendlesohn , Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber , that was told over the strange contributions in October .
Yet previously Brown is not involved : There is nothing that on that points , that it knew of these confusions , although the largest part of the payments was made after its office acceptance in June .
Previously the prime minister settled the half of the work .
It convicted quickly the injury of the laws through its party , but it diluted this determination through the grasping after a well known instrument , an investigation sow shot to the subject - led in order to make the measure fully , of a bishop in the retirement and a judge .
In this case , that are not complicated `` from that to pulling apprenticeships '' very .
If the law was broken , it is a thing for the police .
Seen gives therefrom it other things the Mr. Brown make must to find like something a permanent chairperson for the independent from shot for standards in the public life , that is since six months unoccupied , and ahead step with a sweeping reform of political party financing .
That would require of the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservative and to abandon possibly the special financial relation with the labor unions - bitter pill for a party comrade such as Mr. Brown .
But it should be aware itself some partial facts .
The conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion surveys ; he has to recover two years around voter ; and the single way how he can reach a victory , is through incontestable uprightness and solid competence .

Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitor , it is actual an island of the freedom .

Golden and white beaches , high waves or a sea , that is quiet like a pond .
Palms trees and all including with waiters , who offer pizza , ice and betörende cocktails at the beach .
Kitesurfing , gulf and Roulette .
On the islands of the Caribbean , you find that in superabundant measure .
Only on an island , you find however yet much more , and this island is Cuba , the largest and most beautiful of the large Antillen .
Cuba was at present the Spaniards its bastion for the conquests America .
Kolumbus named it the most beautiful place that a human eye apiece perceived .
Havanna became once a warehouse or run warehouse of treasures , that had stolen the Spaniards in America , and to Europe of transported then .
And then the American epoch came .
The hotel Nacional emerged entirely at the end of the 20th century .
Building let was seen it one of the bosses of the American mafia , Lucky Luciano , for all , what counted in the USA as a crime , ( especially during the prohibition ) , on Cuba gladly and supports - drug , gamble , prostitution .
Under its guests were among other things
Winston Churchill , Ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
In Havanna , high-rises grew went , over the wide Boulevards cars that were years of the past Jahrhundets among the cult symbols of the fifties .
Ernest Hemingway bought itself a property in San Francisco de Paula , in the vicinity Havannas , and in Cojímar , it had lie its yacht .
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio , star of the show business and politician left behind out of entirely America its signatures .
And today ?
At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna , also you can leave behind your autograph .
At the bar in the hotel Nacional , one mixes cocktails for you entirely after wish .
And the cult cars of the fifties go in Havanna until today around because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salty and damp air fell apart already a long time .
If Havanna , especially its oldest part , strongly may have come down , finds nowhere one in the vicinity so many wonderful colonial sights such as just here .
Other places become just out plaster , for example Trinidad .
In regard on that that the tourism brings urgently necessary money , gave it for this development green light .
In the last fifteen years , new hotels emerged not only in Havanna , but rather also in Varadero , at the coast of the province Holguín and also on island such as Cayo Coco , Cayo Guillermo and other .
Cuba offers another Marotte that uniquely is in the world and dresses above all railroad lover .
Steam and diesel business narrow trace railroad to the sugar factories brought the sugarcane of remote plantations .
Your Fuhrpark was not renewed over decades , and so one sees there putzige and fully functioning locomotives whose contemporaries stand in the museum somewhere else a long time .
Excursion goal
The majority of the visitors Kubas does not leave out the bedeutendendsten places .
So one must write over Varadero or Havanna no longer in detail .
Remains only to mention that in the already mentioned property Hemingways a museum is , whose visit should not escape let itself that , that likes this author .
The Viñales-valley in the west of the island is one of the picturesqueest angles Kubas .
The luxurious vegetation are awake on chalk ground .

Trinidad
An age old city , that shortly after the Spaniards the island colonized had , established became .
Renown and wealth the trade with slave and sugar brought it .
The wealth embodied itself in the jewelry beauty of the small city .
The Spanish colonial architecture , strongly influenced of the later French settlers , did hardly change for four hundred years .
Trinidad , between which sea and the Escambray-mountains lain , is a so remote place that it gave there yet into the fifty years of the last century no street , that would have connected the area with the remaining country .
This isolation contributed in addition that it remained unnoticed .
Was nothing constructed there , but was dismantled therefore also nothing , everyone was happy that it had a roof over the head .
If one has more for Trinidad than an afternoon time , it is worthwhile to look at interesting places in the environment , like about the beach Playa Ancón or the `` valley of the sugar factories '' .
In the evening one should go then la Música into the Casa de , is not quiet that animates itself after the darkness , and where the music to the morning .
Baracoa
This village entirely in the East Kubas many a designate as the most beautiful of the island .
Certainly this view is influenced also through the way there .
Both streets that lead of Guantánamo there must overcome and pass high and zerküftete mountains through a landscape , that is hardly touched by human intervention .
The UNESCO included this eastern outpost Kubas thanks to the untouched nature there in its world heir-index .
There the best chocolate is produced , shows in the church one the cross of Kolumbus ( in reality is it about hundred years after the trips of Kolumbus emerged ) , and of the hill where the former castle , the present hotel stands el Castillo , , are to be seen several chalkboard mountains , of which el Yunque is the best known .
Over the coffee , that around , the cigars , the Sierra-Maestra-mountains , the pig bay and the island Isla de Pinos , over the Tropicana-cabaret , the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre , over the Santeria , an African religion , to which the descendants of slave confess themselves , over all that one could write many sides .
Yet , like one so says : Look at better with own eyes .

Climate propaganda
Because the climate debate both the skeptics of the climate change such as that , who place relating to this a social and political debate into the foreground , an unmerciful criticism subjects , must the movement as entire a strong consistency at the day put .
Above all if it concerns a leader of the movement , that , like in the case the district president Zapatero , the battle against the climate change for more important holds than the fight of the Islamic terrorism and even proposes to lock a contract with that .
This proposal brings it however in explanation need regarding the actions , and/or not-actions of its government which contributed decisively in addition , that Spain stands within the EU at the tip of the countries , that fulfilled the specification of the Kioto-protocol at the least .
Who the responsibles are is to be led back for the default of the specification , to which sectors this , and why its government that had proposed that with that has , this development not stopped .
Moreover it is forced now , planned the Spanish citizens that of it to represent measures against the climate change without Umschweife .
Which firms will be concerned therefrom , which behavior of the citizens is supposed to be changed , which individual and collective savings measures must be carried out , and which economic consequences resulting .
More exactly said , who must sacrifice himself and will pay for the rescue of the planet .
To be sure it has and will give it in the future no such explanations .
Just because it concerns itself the sacrificing and the paying .
For the measures , that can be used against the climate change actually , are unpopular .
They are costs empire , uncomfortably and threateningly for the accounts of the firms and citizen .
Zapatero appear seen even the gasoline-cent proposed by the PSOE choice strategic to such an extent dangerously that he saw forced himself to turn back the proposal again .
Accordingly it counts now to rescue the planet with nothing , therefore with pure propaganda and empty sayings without each real consequence .
With impressive statements , commissions , from shots , protocols and new offices .
With its contracts with the planet , the politician so suitable otherwise for choice campaign neither must speak , yet must accuse , yet demand investigate , instead however the demanding edition to embellish the meeting and to enthuse other with its meekness and goodness .
This can happen however only then if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and also does not purport accordingly that the bicycle will become in the future the single means of transportation or may refresh us we only with a specialty .

The climate on the Venus could recognize let an outlook on the future of the earth

Before billions of years would have ruled on the Venus conditions , that very similarly , to which on the earth been would be and even inhabitably can be would have , believe scientist today .
But because of the unimpeded carbon dioxide-greenhouse effect , the erosion of the atmosphere through sun irradiation and a slower rotation speed the Venus hit an entirely other development course .
Today the planet of water is robbed and has is a surface temperature , that hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winding and flash storm .
The insights of the space probe Venus express of the European space flight agency , that has planned examined that for a year , offer a sobering view on that how the earth could develop in view of of that climate changes catastrophic .
Professor Fred Taylor of the department physics at the university Oxford , one of the leaders of the Venus express mission , said : `` It becomes itself clear why the climate is on the Venus so different to that of the earth , during the planets otherwise rather similarly sind . ''
`` Our new data enable it , a scenario to construct , in which the Venus before billions of years such as the earth begun has , possibly with an inhabitable environment . ''

Klaus : Debates of the ecologist are incredulous
Global climate variations damage nominally developing countries most .

In Vienna where it `` a bluer its book , no green planet '' presented , led it from that the debates of the ecologist would be incredulous .
According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference is not would form unacceptable , the one strange mixture of government representatives and such of government organizations , but rather also the basic difference between the rhetoric , that it accompanying , and the reality .
`` The debate there is unstrukturiert , it is some word fireworks , that is only replacement for an actual solution of present problems , '' Klaus said .
The Czech president emphasized in the presentation of its beech that its subject would be very important for it , and that he would engage himself for that therefore so .
It pressed also its contentment about that from that its book would appear in German translation , because `` I often on caricature of my views treffe . ''

Klaus remembered that he would be no Klimatologe , but he has its opinion after sufficient prerequisites in order to write such a book .
Let it be in the end academician , capably to understand and to judge professional treatises , would have experience with statistics and would be also people economist .
As head statements of the beech designated it the thesis that the climate permanently would change and that its variations normally would be therefore , that there would be to global warming no concurring opinion under the scientists , that the consequences of the present variations seriously would not be all too large and and therefore no threat represented , and that the efforts to influence , the development of the climate , would be superfluous , ineffectual and unacceptably costly .
In addition it would stop would see it as someone , whom experiences with totalitarian Sytemen would have , for unacceptably to force other unproven views , it that as a dangerous restriction of the freedom .
On questions of present declared it repeats , would be it not against `` a sensible environmental protection , but against militant organically-activists , that no consideration take on the ratio between expense and yield . ''

Allied in Afghanistan are passive , maintain American .
Too little soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influences the United States according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan .
NATO should sketch a concrete plan after the words of Minister of Defense Robert Gates for the next years .
The mission in Afghanistan would not pass were itself after its presentations , about that in the Scottish Edinburgh the representatives of the countries united , who stationed units in the south of the country .
Next to the growing resistance of sides of the Talibans , the eight interested countries discuss also further coordination plans under the ally .
While the United States called through its Verteigungsminister Robert Gates NATO-units to more activity , Great Britain sees the priority in the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and in the intensification of the economic aid .
`` In Afghanistan a forwards development is noticeable , but only a part of the solution can be military power .
A further part exists says therein to enable the inhabitants , to begin even a further development of the economy and security , '' the British Verteigungsminister of the Browne of the BBC .
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebelliouss reached the highest state according to the American army for five years .
The number of force actions climbed in comparison with the preceding year around 27 percent , in the southern province Helmand even around sixty percent .
NATO-countries stationed soldiers in Afghanistans about 40000 , therefrom about one-quarter in the southern territory .
According to the United States the allies are knocked however at an absolute boundary , what concerns organization and equipment of the units .
Concretely they demand further helicopters , soldiers and experts to the training of the Afghan units .
`` We will have to think about earnestly over the concrete goals for the next time and over the type and manner how we can reach it , '' said Gates .
Similarly the secretary-general expressed himself today NATO , Jaap de Hoop .
`` I am not delighted about that , what we have in Afghanistan by land and in the air to the decree .
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment , that we bräuchten , and that is said too little , '' de Hoop of the agency Reuters to the conclusion of three-day conversations with the Japanese government in Tokyo .
Who is passive
Under the involved countries , also dispute rules in the last months about whether all allies in Afghanistan give its best .
Because of passivity , for example Germany was criticized .
`` The German are represented in Afghanistan relatively in great numbers .
They are not stationed however in zones where there is only a minimum at force and the battle requests for it are so high like for us in the southern and eastern part of the country , '' said Gates .
The British tabloid `` Sun '' designated this week the German soldiers as sluggards .
`` Afghan gadabouts uncovers : The German makes games while our boys fight , '' wrote the `` Sun '' in a contribution , that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers , that play table tennis .
The German picture newspaper passed over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby-contest in the southern part of Afghanistan .

England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas , each of them almost just as hard like the other .
Who should strike as a number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend , Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara ?
And , fewer relevantly in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka , who should the decision not encounter ?
The second question is important because David Graveney , the choice chair is , on proclamation at least under this special title , here in order to help the boss trainer Peter of bog and the captain Michael Vaughan at the same time to decide , and because the table of High Morries , the English managing director fills itself , gradually with application for national voter offices , if not even for which in part-time .
He , who does not get also always the sixth beater position , will be unfortunate , but life is often unjust and the sport is it undoubted .
It never is enabled simple , exact festzunageln , what a person to reach the tip of its occupation branches while someone out never gets differently over the lowest rank , sometimes out of lack of good fortune instead of capacity .
It is not only in the Kricket where the selection is difficult , where judgments are necessary , that always at the end are subjective .
Is it the correct moment for Bopara to climb ?
Is it fairly to Shah if it does it ?
The same can perhaps also in an area further asked become whether for example John Edwards or `` Tubby '' Banerjee , both intelligent young management with good conclusion that know the business well should be conveyed .
Who say can , what the correct class is for a Kricketspieler , unless , it the possibility is given , to swim or to sink .
Obviously numbers have a large influence on decisions , but chances have this also .
Within a team , a Kricketspieler must catch the eye of the captain to the correct moment if he can take a Wicket and a beater must regular chances on the order get if he wants to make as an one-day Kricketspieler impression .
To catch the eyes of the selection more complicated is .
There was many , that in the last season better than , for example when James Anderson were , that will play apparently in the first test , even if Stephen Harmison declares itself to be healthy and like the wind into the networks kegelt .
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 Runs apiece in order to earn a position in this tour .
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same directed average , but both had its highlights and hope for yet more .
Whether Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stage plays , can be only one view sought after .
The choice could decide the careers of both men , or it makes perhaps yet little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka , Gareth Batty in every test played and was was successful in the first , with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs , it however Paul Collingwood , at that time yet fighting for to consolidate itself , created that the breakthrough to an important Testkricketspieler and that although it still is underestimated a double hundred against Australia in Australia punktete , perhaps .
Is probable that Graveney , Vaughan and bog will follow , after a further discussion in the course of the current network session in the Asgiriya stage its conservative instinct and belly feeling practical larger for Shahs knowledge of Boparas youthful enthusiasm .
There are arguments for both .
For Shah , its twinkling and valuable 88 test-debut-Innings in Bombay , 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara that at 22 years of age seven years is younger , and an excellent balance against turned on rolling speaks .
But Shah made was healthy only ten Runs in its two Innings in the May against west Indies in the test in lord , its homeland arenas as a player out of Middlesex , and this , plus its immediate rejection of the selections as a Vaughan in order to turn back its position for the next game , seems taken the momentum out of its striking to have , that was obvious yet in Bombay .
In contrast to that the all-rounder has joie de vivre out of Essex by the shovelful .
It is impressed of nothing on a Kricketplatz and was brought its bearing to one side of therefrom on the point when it had recently a vehicle with four wheel drive in a display for England sponsor Volkswagen überschlagen .
It suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock , but the first what it did , was its Vodafone ( naturally also gesponsort ) to get out and to call its team colleague Alastair Cook , to say that this had observed from a distance , and with enthusiasm : Do `` you have that g sharp marriages ? `` .
Bopara is a much better field player , he kegelt its means speed with some effect here on the playing fields , what seems and strikes to fit to it with confidence and skill .
To select the correct man a thing is , to select the correct moment another .
Perhaps that is the actual art of the selection .
I tend to give in addition Bopara now its chance , what does not mean , that Shah will stand there perhaps not yet well , if , how the tea sentence suggests from Ceylon , it that one is , that will play here this weekend .

Budget is through

In the difference to the lively debate before the voting over the mistrust proposal against the government , did nothing happen this time dramatic .
The house of representatives approved noted this traditionally few , nevertheless highly significant laws in all quiet .
That is to a certain extent paradoxical .
All reigning does not begin and ends with the single chapters and post of the household whether one that pleases or .
The household is an essential component of the politics , is covered however through the power struggle of the government and the opposition .
That is for the media a more grateful subject , and therefore they dedicate more attention to it .
A dispute under politicians is for the public much interesting as sober numbers .
The country households suffered at the past social-democratic governments from three weak points , that the household can not remove for the year 2008 all at once :
The first is the high share of editions that are of law because of obligating , whereby it concerns not only the pensions , but rather also around social editions , that concluded the `` tacit '' coalition of and ( communist ) in the last year before the choices .
The second is the budgetary policies in deficit as a consequence of the first weak point .
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances , i.e . the budgets deficits of the communities .
The largest risk is not however the national budget deficit .
This household is public and eingermaßen under inspection .
A true time bomb is however the budget deficit of the communities .
Many mayors issued in order to open further sources except receipts out of taxes , duties and bank credit for investments , often inconsiderately bonds , through that it its city halls in the excess of debt-ridden .
In the last years , it succeeded them , these guilt through abundant sale of shares of the energy networks and of other provision networks , that had received it in the course of the denationalization of the country , off number .
Now this source is already failed .
As far as we comply only with official and verifiable facts , let 's assess , that :
Our economy already since some years , like the remainder of the world , a growth phase passes through , whose itself that without intermission praises .
That represented a unique possibility for its governments to bring the public finances in order .
Instead debt-ridden these governments the country however yet more .
Other countries , apart from a couple of exceptions such as Hungary , Albania , Pakistan or Egypt , much more sensibly managed than our republic .
That is a giant shame that is to be attributed predominantly the earlier governments .
We belong to the countries , that are threatened , in the global standard seen , at the least of poverty .
Therefore no nassiven social programs are inflated became necessary , that unfortunately just in the last years very superfluously in gigantic size .
Also if it is arrive to paint a part of the absurd populist editions , that were dismissed this year before the choices , , is clearly that if it does not come in next time to a postponement of the retirement age and to a pension reform , ends is practically each politics in this country , and , entire same who at the power , will remain it nothing as a pure administering .
It only easily is exaggerated if one says , that then out of ruling politicians officials become , who divide the largest part of the tax collections mechanically on pensions and social editions .
Therefore this year 's household can be no revolution , but rather can command only the displacement of normal editions through duty editions restraint .
That for 2008 planned deficits of 70 billion crowns would be thoroughly superfluously if earlier governments had not issued in the last ten years , what only went .
If we do not want , that it comes really in addition , that out of ruling politicians pure administration officials become , we must be patient and am this not all too strong coalition government that deliberately is itself however its that the country can issue only so much to take in like he at taxes and fees in a position , wish quiet in the preparation of further reform laws .
Only these enable one gradually execution of a balanced country household .

Deceitful broker risked billions because of inferiority feelings
Bottomless fraud
So Jerome Kerviel designates its former employee the French bank giant Société Générale , owner of the local banka .
It came namely on his account around almost five billion Euro .
It seems however sooner so that Kerviel was only a large player , who wanted to do it its colleague immediately , in addition was certain not incapable .
To the difference to all large bank houses recognized it on time the crisis at the amerikanischenn mortgage market .
`` It is psychically rather weak , '' was to be heard out of the mouth of its superior , that indicated it at the police .
How however out of the statements Kerviels follows , that the French media , for example the daily newspapers Le moons , published , was it a person who had obtained end of last year with its businesses profits in the amount of 1.6 billion Euro .
Crisis not only in America
`` All what I wanted , money was to be earned for my bank , '' maintains it in its statements .
In the summer , it was arrive it to earn just at the American crisis a half billion of Euro .
It had spotted the opportunity in addition namely already at the year beginning .
In February there were already first messages about the fact that so-called Sub-Prime-mortgages are given , how it low-income customer or such , the already early payment problems had , , in difficulties run would become .
Influence on the entire economy not however should have this crisis .
Kerviel did not believe that and retained right .
At the end of the year , it had its profit up to 1.6 billion Euro tightened .
`` Already as I the first half billion earned had , knew I not how I should explain that , '' gives Kerviel to and says further that it had retained definitively nothing for itself .
During the entire interrogation , it admits that it falsified documents , so that one would not come would slink it on that .
He managed even to lead its bosses behind the light , also if itself gradually the Eurex-stock exchange for its businesses interested .
Risk profit
Did it fear to fail ?
Probably hardly .
`` I thought , that it the simple fact , that I for the bank 1.6 billions earns would have , satisfied place . ''
From where did it take the courage to risk so much ?
He gradually had to acquire himself its position .
Into the Société Générale , it entered in 2000 , directly after it had concluded its study at the university Lyon , .
Its annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollars .
After two years , he was already assistant of a broker and in 2005 , he became independent brokers with an annual salary of 90000 dollars .
Nevertheless it knew that it never would earn so much like other .
`` Already in my first conversation in 2005 I knew that one observed me .
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development , '' Kerviel explained the investigation official .
But already soon after its entrance , the first large success came .
With the shares of the alliance , it earned much in that it set at the Londoners bomb marred a half billion of Euro on losses of this title .
And that was the trigger - now wanted it more .
Solang you profit make , let 's let you
`` That is like a snow ball , '' said it the policeman .
But the bosses knew suspected nominally of all , or it .
`` As long as I earned money , one closed the Augen . ''
Yet then the large blow came at the beginning of this year .
At a single day , it lost a billion of Euro .
At a weekend middle January it wanted to balance that .
When it came on Monday to the work , it was already no longer employee of the bank .
And a couple of day later announced the bank that it had lost on his account five billions of Euro .
And how did they come would slink it on that ?
He made himself suspect through a vacation .
`` I took only four days of the preceding year .
A broker who takes no vacation is one , that does not want , that one views it into the cards , '' said Kerviel in conclusion .

The Spanish private transmitter Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and overtakes therefore its rival Antena 3 .
have it
With this sentence , the manager of Telecinco , Paolo Vasile announced , in stock exchange end its contentment . The transmitter led by it had raised its value by the dual of its rival Antena 3 .
An aspect however softened its joy : That is exactly what is injured me ; that we a higher growth , but rather that we slighter losses it did not assess .
It emphasized that they all too deeply sunk in spite of the weak market
Telecinco concluded yesterday the day with a plus of 2.54 % .
This profit decreases its previous this year 's losses on 15.66 % .
The goodwill reaches according to Bloomberg now the 4,488.88 million Euro whereby Mediaset is controlled the head share of the capital ( 52 % ) , and Vocento is involved only with 13 % .
The rival Antena 3 lost yesterday 1.52 points and has had for January a loss of altogether 40.5 % to register so that its market value with 2,193.46 million amounts to itself on the half .
The market values of other börsennotierten communication business on the other hand climbs ; in the case of Sogecable on 3,571 million , in Prisa ( publisher of the periodical Cinco Días ) on 2,518.53 million and in Vocento on 1,779 million .
That compare to lets derive Antena 3 itself from the fact that it itself two similar business so Vasile .
Uncertain yet the question appears act can , to which extent we actually stock exchange technical , to which price and like we it can form on customer plain lucrative .
Telecinco explained be a week ago intention to climb this year to the first television station with more than 1000 million gross profits out of advertising revenues . This assured Guiseppe Tringali , the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña , the Werbeunternehmen of the group .
If the intention should be transferred , the transmitter its Werbeeinkünfte would increase in comparison with the 965.4 million out of the preceding year around 3.6 % .
In the case of Antena 3 , the net revenue climbed around 1.6 % in the first nine stock exchange months ( up to 734.4 million ) while the net incomes were able to show only a climb of 0.7 % ( 630.4 million out of the TV business ) .
The analysts see the head factor for the stock exchange course better in the comparison by Telecinco in the high Payout-Ratio , that the firm was able to show to the present moment : The business led by Alejandro Echevarría caused 2006 a 100-percent dividend fallout .
Vasile assures however that the Ratio yet could vary after the purchase of 33 % of the shares of Endemol , with Mediaset as a mother company , , also if it is yet too early for an official announcement .
Are the official compromise obligated to pay at least 50 % of the shares even if we indicated previously always substantially more .
I hope that we can content our stockholders this year , whose share value we already were able to increase through the purchase of 33 % of the Endemol-shares .
After statements of the analysts , the market shows currently certain loss tendencies .
Lehmann Brothers reduced first recently its profit calculation in Telecinco for this year around 4 % and for 2009 around 7 % .
Let this be the consequence of the abridgment of the presumable rate of increase that will be due 2008 of 10.5 % to 8.4 % and 2009 of 5.5 % on 5.1 % .
This reduced also the presumable profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 around 4.5 % and for 2009 around 7.5 % .
3 options .
1 .
Ibersecurities : sets on its high effective yields and be persistent potential and recommends therefore the purchase of both shares .
2 .
Caja Madrid : Telecinco ( buy ) measures a more advantageous position as a result of that and the prospering market in than an Antena 3 ( hold ) .
3 .
JPMorgan : recommends to put back the expectations in both cases in view of that ( satiated market and worse economy climate )

Three British bank , that should be placed for its roll in the deceitful system with the former head finance leader by Enron , Andrew Fastow , before court , its petitions in indebted changed on Wednesday .
David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had pleaded originally for seven cases of fraud under use of telecommunication means for the alleged Konspirieren with Fastow in a secret finance fraud in 2000 in order to enrich itself on costs of its employer , on innocently .
The procedure had been prepared on the January .
But during a hearing before court before US district judge Ewing who e junior every pleaded for a case of fraud under use of telecommunication means indebted .
The three former managements of Greenwich NatWest , a unit of the Royal bank of Scotland Group PLC , became in Great Britain in the course of extradition procedure , that lasted two years , well known .
In the United States , its case is happening an end of an investigation that was started after Enrons breakdown in 2001 .
The accusations submitted originally against it in 2002 made Fastow aware that it was the goal of an investigation of the government in the connection with the Enron decline .
The accusation against the bank - named the `` NatWest three '' - maintained , it had come in 2000 after Houston in order to devise a deceitful conspiracy with Fastow and its former Topberater Michael Kopper .
Greenwich Natwest had invests into a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron , that was controlled by Fastow , that the architect of innumerable deceitful Enron-wheeling and dealings was , who contributed in addition to tear the firm in the bankruptcy swirl .
Beginning 2002 had estimated the bank the value its participation in the subsidiary to be zero , but the three British men knew that it had considerable value in reality .
A business under Koppers inspection acquired the shares of the bank at the subsidiary for 1 million dollar .
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a participation in this business .
According to the accusation , Fastow represented falsely vis-à-vis Enron that the energy business would pay 20 million dollars at Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary .
But actually the 20 million dollars at the British bankers , Fastow and other went .
The bankers received 7.3 million dollar , during Fastow , Kopper and other about 12.3 million dollar absahnten , according to the accusation .
Fastow confessed itself in January 2004 in two Anklagepunkten on plot for its roll in the Enrons bankruptcy indebted .
The British trio later was arrested three months .
Fastow dismounts a 6-year-old prison sentence in the alliance prison of Louisiana .
Kopper dismounts a punishment of three years and a month in an arrangement in Texarkana .
Everyone the three men was at liberty on the basis of a 1 million dollar bond that made it required , that they lived in the United States in expectation of the legal proceedings .
Enron , once that seventh largest business of the nation , zerbröckelte in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of bookkeeping trick disguise no longer more long the billion guilt or were able to appear let weakening enterprises profitable .
The breakdown destroyed thousands of jobs , more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans from .
The Enron-founder Kenneth Lay and the former chairman of the board Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for its rolls in the connection with the Enron-breakdown .
Skilling dismounts a punishment of more than 24 years .
Lays convictions for plot , fraud and other accusation points became void after it died last year because of heart disease .

Spectacular repair at the room station
More will have needed astronaut Scott Parazynski and its comrades of the garrison of the international room station ( ISS ) than seven hours in the space in order to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective sun collector , that is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work on the station .
A ventured exit , that to carry out based on its duration , that distance by inhabitable modules , that speed , with which it was organized and that of the astronauts tools , around the repair , several records obtained has .
The problem appeared on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the room ferry Discovery , a zylinderförmiges part large that should receive soon the European and Japanese scientific Labore .
This module is a type landing bridge for the module-Labore .
But one must be able to furnish it with current .
It was the second task of the garrison therefore , a 17.5 module heavy tons to the current production over sun collectors , that was already on the ISS , to transfer in order to bring it into its final position .
After it had transferred it , the garrison at the restructuring of the sun collectors of the module whose chip expanse amounts to 76 meters made itself .
And at the same time happened it that one of the collectors that can be unfolded like accordion was damaged , by a clamped cable on a length by approximately a meter
The restructuring was stopped in order to not to damage the collector yet more .
The astronauts , who leave originally for a control gear the room ferry Discovery , and then another sun collector whose rotation system was defective , repair should , saw forced itself to dedicate itself to the damaged collector .
And Scott Parazynski was selected , at the end of the 30 meter of long remote-controlled arm the room ferry , that had been mounted at that of the station , to walk around , in order to carry out the repair .
It is one of the best ( Wetraumgänger ) of the NASA .
Largely , resistant , very sent , has developed it one well torso and long arms .
That 46-jähirige trained physician was selected therefore , the sun collector to .
After it exactly had appraised the damages , it cut the defective cable and secured a type rails on the damaged place .
It became remained of a second of that in the vicinity of the lock , supports , and , of inside , of the other astronauts , under them Peggy Whitson , commander of the garrison .
The tool that it used , a mini hockey beater , with insulator wraps up , around on the sun collectors , that produce several hundred volts to prevent an electric blow , had devised the astronauts on board the station and .
When the action was concluded , Scott Parazynski waited until the collector completely was unfolded , before it counted its tools and turned into the station back .
Yesterday afternoon wetted the astronauts a half day relaxation before today seven astronauts turned on the room ferry Discovery back in order to begin presumably Wednesday the return flight to the earth .

Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
The Venus is thought in spite of its life hostile atmosphere of the earth more similarly than until now : The European space probe `` Venus express '' discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind turbulence at the Poland how they appear in the winter also on the earth .
For almost three decades scientists have assumed that it flashes on the Venus .
Now the European probe furnished `` Venus express '' the proof - it sensed electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere up : The flashes on the Venus shoot in a height of approximately 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud , reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine `` nature '' .
Flashes have emerge let loudly the famous `` Ursuppen-theory '' life on the earth : Thunderstorms should have encouraged reactions in the ocean , that led to the development of amino acids , the building blocks of life .
Not so on the Venus : `` If it ever life there gave , must it in the very early story been its '' , explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington .
Today there would be allowed to be hardly something living on the surface of the Venus : The atmosphere is approximately hundred time poet as on the earth , it rule sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees .
`` The Venus is perhaps the devil twin of the earth , but it is a twin '' , said Russel .
Why the Venus , that is so similar to the earth in mass and size , hit , a so completely other development , the reason question of the Esa-mission is .
The start of `` Venus express '' in November 2005 a milestone was for the Venus-research because since beginning of the nineties no more probe was expressly to the investigation of this planet underway .
The newest research results , that are introduced now `` nature '' in several -articles , underline in the opinion of the researchers not only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system .
`` You show also , that the commonalities of our neighbor planet with the earth more largely are than first of all supposed '' , divides the Esa with .
So the researchers found also a cloud swirl next to the already well known turbulence wind at the north pole at the south pole , that revolves yet substantially faster .
The phenomenon reminds one of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere , writes a researcher team around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica .
The two most internal planet of the solar system has almost the same mass such as the earth and is almost just as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers .
The planet designated also as morning star or evening star circles in almost 225 days around the sun .
He revolves however much more slowly around itself : A Venus day lasts 243 earth days .
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure reminds one of 92 cash hardly of the earth , scientists assume that both planets emerged under entirely similar prerequisites .
On both , water gathered , that remained on the earth in oceans , on which Venus got lost however in the space .
And during carbon dioxide on the earth in carbonate rock fixed is , makes it on the Venus the large part of the atmosphere from .

In many places is saved at disinfectant
This year more were registered than thousand infections in hospitals , that were to be led back to an improper contact with antibiotics .
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals , the overcrowding of the beds , the overburdening of the personnel - all factor , that are the damming of the infections not exactly beneficial , so the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center .
In many places is saved also in the disinfectants .
In the Traumatologie department of the János hospital , a MRSA-infection was diagnosed lately .
The bacterium resistant against antibiotics was found in a masculine patient , who was delivered after a heavy accident into the hospital .
The patient was isolated .
At the beginning of the year , there was here already a similar infection .
The injured of a heavy car accident was released out of the hospital , had to return little later the man to be sure with a MRSA-infection . An important operation could not be carried out since then because of the bacterium , that is still in the body of the patient , yet .
Until 10 December of this year released infections were reported out of hospitals 1094 through multiresistente pathogen at the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system , so the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center , Karolina Böröcz .
So many , through multiresistente pathogen released infections were registered in the hospitals therefore with security , would be allowed to be however higher the dark figure .
About two-thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) became of the MRSA , that released against Methicillin-Oxacillin of resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
The Staphylococcus aureus ( SOWED ) bacterium carries about one-third of the persons in its nose , without that it would cause an illness .
SOWED-contingent infections ( like about sore throat , tonsillitis , inflammations of the skin or wounds ) react usually well to antibiotics , they are well curable .
The means will dose improper used develop from quickly spread themselves to be sure to highly or , that well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics-resistant , that under corresponding conditions in the hospitals .
Especially with patients with weakened , or durably badly functioning immune system , but also in older , or patients with slight body weight these bacteria can heavy infections how about wound infection or blood poisoning cause , therefore sepsis .
According to the MRSA-infection is belong nothing special , such occurrences to the sick house everyday life to the medical leader of the János hospital .
One would not be allowed to confuse the infection with the epidemic , manhte Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA does not give it only there where it is not sought .
Resistant to antibiotics
`` Such patients are isolated , the care personnel carries rubber gloves and costumes in the provision , and we control the antibiotics '' necessary for the treatment - so Tibor Nyulasi .
In its delivery into the hospital , the patients are examined to be sure on MRSA , not always can be avoided an infection nevertheless .
Sample removals too rarely
The majority of the infections released by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable , to be sure let the presently ruling conditions and circumstances be unfavorable for the checking of the origin or the expansion of the multiresistenten pathogen , says Karolina Böröcz .
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and age homes , the hospitals should examine the delivered patients and should isolate MRSA-infected immediately .
In the Hungarian hospitals , the microbiological sample removal becomes however not so frequent practice .
Finally because there are not no subsidies on the part of the national health insurance company for this investigation .
Most cases would come therefore first then at the daylight if the patient has already a noticeable MRSA-infection , so the medical leader of the epidemiology center .
On the part of the European Union , it gives gives strict recommendations to the corresponding use of antibiotics in the humane medicine , it however also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes .
Antibiotic-therapies should be purposeful , that is , are microbiological investigations necessary so that no resistance to can form the means , to be sure this directive also not always is kept of hospitals .
Under the ambulatory , or in the reason provision of present patient let microbiological sample removals be themselves even even rarer , so Karolina Böröcz .
Saved becomes in the disinfectants
Scientific proofs belay that MRSA is transferred by a patient to the other most frequently by the care personnel .
For this very reason approaches gives the Händewaschen , or the carrying of gloves and costumes a large meaning , to be sure it also on this zone considerable deficiencies in the hospitals .
MRSA is transmitted through Tröpfcheninfektion or contact , exists in the domestic hospitals however not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient .
The rooms are even often overfills , that lined up beds tightly to each other , although there should be between them from epidemiological point of view a distance of at least 1.5 meters .
How Karolina Böröcz further notices in , comes gives it unfortunately in the financially less well placed hospitals even before that in disinfectant saved becomes , it few caretakers , many patients - all factor that favor the origin of infections quite .
Such infections are there demonstrable far less frequent , or the further distribution of the pathogen can be delayed where these precautions are kept , so Karolina Böröcz .
Government program against MRSA
To got MRSA-infections into the handle caused the health insurances enormous costs , therefore they are fought everywhere .
In England for example the prevention became of MRSA , and/or its checkings in the government program held .
After first signs , the program is successfully - belay like published data , is the tendency of the MRSA-infections in England retrograde .
The European center for illness prevention ( ECDC ) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistenten pathogens ( under that also MRSA ) , as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities explains .

Schäuble warns against Krawallen such as in France
Street battle with the police , shots , burning cars : Wolfgang Schäuble warns against Krawallen such as in France .
It would have to be done everything so that social discontent in Germany would not unload itself in force on the street , demanded the federal minister of the interior .
Barricades burned , Randalierer shot with shotguns on the police : After the heavy Jugendkrawallen in France , federal minister of the interior fears Wolfgang Schäuble ( Christian Democratic Union ) in Germany a similar development .
`` We must respect on that that also here social explosive material does not construct itself and unloads in force .
We seriously must take that '' , said it the press '' appearing `` new in Hanover .
Every young person does not manage with the fast variation of the social reality .
Alliance , countries and community worked already with stress on that to dismantle problems , said Schäuble .
That concerns not only the integration of migrants .
`` Of the integration summit to the Islam conference , the already first Erfolge . '' shows .
For all-clear , let it be however too early .
Schäuble referred at the same time on that that there would not be cities structural and sociological problems in German suburbs such as in France .
In northern suburbs of Paris , youths in the past nights had delivered herself heavy street battle with the police .
Also in Toulouse , cars and public buildings burned .
Larger integration efforts of the Federal Government the chairperson of the Turkish demanded meanwhile community in Germany , Kenan Kolat .
In view of the Krawalle in France , Kolat warned against `` imitation effects '' .
Let the situation in Germany be to be sure not as disruptive as in France .
Action requirement exists however nevertheless .
Kolat reprimanded on that that the unemployment rate would be with youth with migration background `` above average high '' under 25 years .
It would have to be provided above all for more traineeships .
Kolat emphasized : `` We must the youth a perspective give . ''
The chairperson of the Turkish community joined would find however thereto , in Germany more than in France `` a social inspection in the families instead of '' .
Many youth with migration background did not want to destroy moreover that , what its parents constructed here .
Kolat warned : `` However nevertheless must we pay attention . ''
One had to give the youth `` quickly the possibility at work and education to participate '' .
Meanwhile it remained suburb Villiers-le-Bel in the night in the Parisian extensively quiet .
Hundred shafts of the police were in the use , a helicopter flew over with floodlight the zone .
The responsible authorities reported three arrests as well as a couple trashcans burning and cars .
Since the day before , a public notice of approximately 1000 security forces provides for quiet .
The police would reach through so long how it would be necessary , gave notice Secretary of the Interior me yard of Alliot-Marie after a visit in the suburb on .
In the night on Tuesday had been injured in Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel approximately 80 policemen .
In the consequence night , the unrest spread on Toulouse .
The Krawalle ignited itself at a traffic accident , with which on Sunday two youths had come around life .
After first insights of the district attorney 's office , the police carries no guilt at the death of the youth .

Festival days are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary , holidays legally exactly are regulated so that the practice of the Umdisponierens of the workday established itself all around the holiday meanwhile , to be sure given us the coming year fewer such days .
Also in the EU and in America , one understands something else under `` holiday '' .
The Hungarian right system distinguishes between country holidays and working free days .
Working free days are stand usually church holidays , or with important historic events in connection .
We celebrate for example also new year : Both the last day of the old , and the first day of the new year working free days are - latter alone already therewith the new year 's eve-celebrating rest can themselves .
In the entire year , we have altogether fourteen holidays .
The country holidays are the 15 March , that reminds one of the revolution of 1848 , and the 23 October , the commemorative days of the revolution of 1956 .
On the 20 August , the country foundation is celebrated , on the 1 May the work , remember on that 1st and 2 November we our dead .
In addition it gives two holidays apiece to easter , Pentecost , and Christmas .
There our countries , nationally fall or religious holiday rarely on a weekend , proved itself the practice of the `` workday-postponement '' in the cases , in which we would work before or after the holiday only a day .
Weekends extended is the price of that to be sure that we very probably work at the Saturdays before that , or must go into the school .
When this day , that falls before or after the holiday , worked off , in the end , is determined for some time years of the labor minister in an own ordinance .
The legal specification applies to all employers and -nehmer , for public employees and official of the public service likewise .
Excluded are only firms and arrangements , in which the business is continued without interruption , therefore also at the holidays .
This year the working order is brought only through the holidays at the end of the year somewhat in confusion : From the 24 December , life remains formally stand in this country , take there that for the days between Christmas and new year 's eve time balance , or the vacation canceled expressly for that .
In the next year , more holidays fall into the week middle , and/or on the end of the week so that there will be less Umdisponierungen in the workdays , than this year .

Small Saarland , good development
The smallest state is in the vocational education leading and shines even with the international alignment of its universities .
Only in a development field , the same deficit such as the remainder of the country presses the Saar countries .
`` I explained yesterday for the 50th time that we are '' no Frenchmen - this slogan placarded the smallest state selbstironisch to its 50th birthday to a not Saar countries .
At the same time France and Luxembourg play a large role in the educational system of the Saar country that lies in the development monitor of the institute of the German economy Cologne ( IW ) on place five .
So the universities cooperate already out of tradition closely with the neighboring countries .
The university in Saarbrücken was established 1948 of the Frenchmen .
Until today , studying can lock here its study with a double diploma or even triple diploma .
The share of foreign studying with 15.6 percent is accordingly high .
The Saarland in above average number brings yet also the country children at the universities - many of them without a conclusion at the secondary school .
`` In the Saarland uses one the professional educational system '' , says Axel Plünnecke , development expert in the IW .
Its study authorization acquires lies more than every fifth youth at an occupation training , therewith the Saarland more than seven points over the alliance average .
Also the combination possibilities of professional and academic education comparatively strongly are expanded .
Measured by is the population the equipment with dualen courses of studies the second-best in Germany .
In spite of the practical education and increasing demand , the number of the engineer graduate in the past years sank however around one-third .
Therefore the Saarland development ministry obligated the universities now to a marketing campaign for engineering specialties .
`` At the allgemeinbildenden schools have we after the first Pisa-study some reforms activated '' , says a speaker of the development ministry .
So the government introduced nationwide comparison tests .
Therewith the children earlier begin is , to learn the last Kita-year free of charge - a model that in the mean time also other states copy .
First future comparison studies will show whether the achievements of the students persistently improve themselves .
In Pisa 2003 , the share of the risk students of 29 shrank to 20 percent .
Altogether the Saarland increased itself however not so strongly like other states .
The Bavaria calculate better .
And to the disappointment of the Saar countries , foreign language knowledge are not measured in Pisa - in this area could one otherwise points .
For the language of the neighbors is at secondary schools duty - also if the Saar countries are no Frenchmen .

Which insurance is suitable for me best ?
The MOTOR VEHICLE-insurance , that uncovers a case of damage caused possible by the driver , includes a high costs expense , whose height wiederrum of different factors depends , among other things on age , sex , moment of the creation of the driver 's license , marital status , type of the car to be assured and its utilization , etc .
To possess a car only the beginning is .
For it is to be found even more hard the suitable MOTOR VEHICLE-insurance than the correct vehicle model .
First of all once must be clear one wherewith we have to do it here .
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder .
This agreement is held in writing by means of an insurance contract , that determines that the company receives the arranged insurance premium and is obligated in return to produce in a case of damage the corresponding settlement .
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that puts together itself through several factors , among other things age , sex , moment of the creation of the driver 's license , marital status , type of the vehicle to be assured or its utilization .
The insurance companies fix its prices corresponding to the statistics so that in a higher accident danger also higher contribution payments become due .
For this reason must both perform belay less contribution payments over 25-year-old and women , for statistics that these groups show a slighter accident quota thanks to its caution .
The same applies also to married persons , there this after statements of the statistical values and accordingly also after conviction of the businesses , to less accidents tend like single .
The utility that is ascribed the vehicle impairs the frequency of the going and therewith also the probability of an accident .
The more frequent the utilization , the more probable the damage .
In the assembly of the premium , the insurances must consider a whole series of points .
For this reason also the driver thoroughly must study the situation in order to select exactly the car insurance , that meets its personal needs at that soon .
We list the most important points here now , that one should take in the selection of an insurance into consideration , in order to be able to encounter not only an achievement , but rather also a preisorientierte choice .
That under 25-year-old encounter in the choice of a bargain insurance on numerous hindrances , e.g . the slight driving experience and the driver 's license .
Even if it would be for an ideal insurance protection best , to lock a Vollkaskoversicherung , it gives nevertheless more low-priced alternative .
The careful drivers can select a Vollkasko with deductible so that the achievements of a Vollkaskoversicherung uncovered to be sure , but are offered to a low price .
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay a part of the sum emerged by the damage itself .
Sum is determined before conclusion of the contract and based on the height of the insurance premium . This is declared more highly the more slightly that to be paid Luis Noguera , head representative of Spain in First Europe , one settlement enterprising to be Online-insurances .
Another option is not the expanded insurance , that assures the customer against external accident damages , however against the damages emerged at the own car .
Moreover this type of the insurance would uncover theft , fire and vehicle loss .
Here an advice .
If you are old under 25 years , it lies increases in your hand , to sink the insurance costs ; so your credit in that you try to go carefully and to avoid accidents .
A credit is a decline of the basis tariff at the corresponding insurance company .
In the opposite in addition included a punishment payment a raising purported tariff .
Height credit and punishment payments depend on the company and its yields .
If the business has a yield empire year behind itself , it can permit itself , clarifies the bonus-payments too Noguera .
As soon as the 25-Jahre-Marke 25-Jahre-Marke years 25-Jahre-Marke SIGN is exceeded , it is to be locked for the drivers simpler a contract . Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving experience the accident quota sinks .
Therefore it is the most meaningful to decide on a Vollkaskoversicherung with deductible .
The youths can pull no utility out of its previous experience , both in the case an accident and at the time the going that of directors Spanish of the European business clarifies joins , and thereto that the majority of the accidents happen in the second practice year , after that was discarded the .
Nevertheless it is at a married customer , who possesses no children , more advisable to lock a Vollkaskoversicherung ; naturally only then if it allows the financial situation of the corresponding person also .
On the part of the insurer , married couples with children count as the customers with the slightest accident quota , and accordingly low also its contribution payments fall from .
In this case , a Vollkaskoversicherung with deductible ( in a sum about 300 Euro ) would be the best option . In the case that one received a high credit , recommends itself an expanded insurance that uses first to the third vehicle year .
Altogether more relaxed go and possess a larger buying power that permits it them , a higher contribution payment places Luis Noguera firmly .
For pensioner , it offers itself to lock a Vollkaskoversicherung with deductible ( in a sum about 150 Euro ) , or an expanded insurance , that uses first in a sufficiently high credit .
In the end one must hold that the car insurance is somewhat very important , not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages , but rather rescues also , because it high costs , that require it , that a thorough selection is encountered , that corresponds to our personal situation .

The team of Gordon Strachan Shakhtar could suffice a defeat even in a defeat of the FC to qualify around .

Six deterrent trifles in order to annoy working colleague
Never receive e-mails that we to post forget language messages , that we - harmless lies , that are noticeable us not at all more : They bring `` color '' into the everyday life at the job .
The question is merely whether one becomes accustomed to these small unpleasantnesses , or one stands better the challenge and tries these misleading , for other annoying situations deliberately to vermweiden .
Tips .
`` Sorry , I forgot to align that someone has '' called of the marketing-department - says a colleague to you .
Did that one neglect through it a Meeting ?
At best one regretted it and to rectify tried it in that one calls perhaps in the marketing-department and stood remorseful , one would have forgotten to align the message ( that is the less usual method ) .
Usually the thing with an apology is removed .
Before one entangles himself into embarrassing excuses , one should consider wherewith one can its colleague moments of truly unpleasant ready and try to avoid these situations deliberately .
Loaned something , what not belongs one even ?
There is hardly somewhat more irritating as if one grasps after a document , office accessories , or the telephone , but it is not there .
Did yesterday the notebook device lie yet on the desk - today early is it away ?
Is that or lost discovered believed ball-point pens about on the desk of a colleague ?
Without ask should one himself nothing of the colleagues loan , for it right will annoy if it assess , that somewhat gotten away is .
Therefore , no envelopes or postal service it it out of the office into the pocket stick could encounter , for it one even : keins more there if one needs it yet urgently .
Getratsche over private life of the colleagues ?
There is no effective means to delay a gossip , that was set already into the world .
Who with whom made , what ?
Where and why ?
One should not tie the information ( or suppositions ) over private life of the colleagues if possible every to the nose !
And if someone opens herself yet and betrays us its most internal secret , should not abuse we this confidence !
Best one is quiet like a grave instead of aligning the just not present even if other know also over the problems of the colleague .
Reported without reason suffer ?
If one calls in the office in order to call in sick with reference to tormenting headache because one feels just unwell , or simply only would like to rest itself , should became clear be one over one in that : The own work , urgent settlement , projects with firm appointments the colleagues must now instead of one even settle .
The colleague therefore not vilely play !
If one knows already on the day before , that one will not create it at the next day into the office , or that something could dazwischenkommen , why one must remain at home , should report one it on time so that neither the colleagues , yet the boss are confronted unexpectedly with the absence .
G sharp ummahs , chuckle , telephoning
Is one deepened just in its work , is disturbed however suddenly by the loud chuckle of the colleague ?
Overheard unintentional a telephone conversation , that one better not should have heard ?
One should not irritate the colleagues with sums , singing , loud conversations ( that one over its heads away leads ) , Getrampel , lasting scolding or grumbling .
That everything can be very disturbing , also if they are not deepened just in a task ( write , plan , organize ) .
Is the other guilt always ?
If a project is not timely finished , one forgot an important letter or important message to post , should seek one the guilt of the own forgetfulness not with others !
If possible one should not dissuade himself on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues !
Best one its mistakes vouched excuses themselves , and themselves if other were concerned also therefrom !
The question how one rectify the mistake , or can make up the neglected , is mounted only all too !
In the office - a feeling such as at home ?
Training pair of pants and Schlapfen : Comfortably for at home , did nothing lose however in the office !
Once then one should not clothe himself so leger if it the job actually would allow !
Merely to sloppy become not - one should both its colleagues , and itself so far respect , that one itself in the office corresponding to clothes - if desires , also lovely and elegantly !

Does an Endjahres-Rally be forthcoming the stock exchange ? Disagreement at the experts based on the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks to the year conclusion at the stock exchange , the investors rub themselves with regard to the coming Endjahres-Rally already the hands .
Nevertheless the experts can generate relating to this no certain prognoses .
Banif believes in that statistically observes , the month of December the stock exchange normally with a positive market development walks
Nevertheless it is not advisable to generate prognoses short-termed and only on the base of statistics . If seriously tensions to be taken determine the current market events
Although other experts do not approve of a such strong increase in prices in that last week the year , these notice in given determined becomes nevertheless , that stock exchange course by that liquidity of the market and the market participant . These invest based on the lacking at certain share fund mainly in pension fund , which strongly is concerned by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend there to productive assets .
Consequently the stock exchange will show in the opinion of these experts sooner one sooner lateralen , of market variations of influenced course trend , all because we can not estimate yet the sizes of the possible decline of the interest rate the US-bank of issue to lead back an uncertainty that above all to the increased crude oil-price and the danger of the climb of the inflation rate
Javier bar Rio , chairperson of the sale department in BPI in Spain , agrees therewith that it would be a ventured moment to announce an impending market-Rally .
Chances stand assures not very the expert .
The Spanish share index Ibex lost a value of 4 % already since its highly sign on the 8 November of 15,945.7 points .
But all experts do not divide the same negative opinion .
After view of Juan Solana , analyst in Intermoney , could the Ibex 35 as a result of the restructuring of the Investmentfonds and the traditional subsidy undertaken each year around this time of the pension fund , that lock year successfully with almost 16,000 points .
Nevertheless the expert lifts forth that this year could develop the things somewhat differently ; above all based on that already in the second December week , and accordingly directly after the bridge day to the day of the state , taking place Endjahres-Rally .
In the opinion of the analyst the price variations would not influence the market tendencies .
After estimation of Federico Olucha , analyst in the bank Inversis , be copy could the previous judgments to the market condition on an almost technical level , what could lead in addition , themselves soon a deviation of the index value , whose sizes depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis .
The analyst trusts on that that these positively fall out .
In the selection of the values , that should push the Ibex to new maximums , the analysts are themselves united .
Solana of Intermoney assures that year the large values at the row
To the value-winners , the expert would count the two large banks and some immobile companies , that current sector are too expensive to the given moment
In the meantime Federico Olucha assures of the bank Inversis that the climbs in connection with the bank sector and industry sector will walk .
If the Rally actually happens , the immobile companies will profit from it .
ACS was hope in the last months on Aufholkurs and we that other immobile companies such as Ferrovial and FCC the same way so the expert .
With respect to the increased consumption behavior during the Christmas days , the consumption periodic will determine the market events in the last half of the year .
On the other hand the expert believes that also the technologies will obtain positive revenue results , even if they are represented on the Spanish market only in slight number .
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years , the December showed sinking share price developments only in two cases .
When end 2003 burst the technology-bubble , this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and initiated simultaneously the previously last real Endjahresrallye .
The December showed this year , in which the Ibex 35 made up around 28.17 points , an increase in prices of 6.68 % .
Whether 2008 becomes the fifth profitable year in consequence , ( the Ibex climbs since January around 8.36 % ) and also an Endjahresrally can show , will appear .

A colleague informs about the reception of illegal Internet download into the punishment code :
A . A law breach , that would become concerned with six months custody , would be the downloads of a song .
If you rob however wiederrum a music business under a value of 400 Euro , this counts only as a simple offence ( article 623.1 ) .
B . If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 Euro , the theft becomes to be sure as a Straftateingestuft , nevertheless the punishment falls more slightly out of than in a download ( articles 234 punishment code ) .
C. If you swipe a car and it return forty hours later again , the punishment is always even slighter than in a download ( article 244.1 ) .
D. It is fewer seriously at a fight to participate than in a music data-exchange .
To be involved in a rebellious discussion a prison sentence of three to 12 months stretches after ( articles 154 punishment code ) while the data-exchange has an imprisonment of six months up to two years as a consequence
( Articles 270 punishment code ) .
E. After the article 184.2 of the punishment code , sexual annoyance badly is regarded at the job as fewer than the downloading of a DVD-film out of the Internet .
F. The trade with copyrighting-protected films , whose Autorisierung did not take place through the authors , is stopped a higher punishment than the distribution of pornographic film material at minor ( articles 186 ) .

Everyone would know that Germany in the foreign policy had to preserve sensitive balance , emphasized the President of the Federal Republic , took however Merkel before the accusation in protection , it operates a new China-politics .
`` The Federal Chancellor distance did not take of the traditional a-China-politics .
That knows also China '' , said Köhler .
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier ( SPD ) had recognize let indirectly displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked therefore out of rows of the union .
Steinmeier had lamented among other things the `` shop-window politics '' of the union in the foreign policy .
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the chancellor 's office , it came to violent irritations in the German-Chinese ratio .
So the Chinese leadership unloaded not only the German Treasury Minister Peer Steinbrück ( SPD ) , but rather froze according to information from the MIRROR also the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel requested China head of the government whom Jiabao now to admit the reception of the Dalai Lamas as a mistake .
China rejects it if European politicians in official function receive the religious leader of the Tibeter , strengthened whom Jiabao the Chinese position .
The deeds and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that it would try , Tibet and the further tibetische region that comprises also other current provinces to split off of China .

Political Capital : Hungarian corps increases country risk
In the opinion of the department for risk analysis ( Risk Analysing division ) of Political Capital the activities of the corps established Hungarian in this August with support the `` movement for a better Hungary '' raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard .
In the `` risk warning-report '' of the institute , it is named among other things : In the connection with the activities of the Hungarian corps , the highest political risk places lead could '' the `` intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gipsy and not gipsy population in Hungary there , that even short-termed to violent ethnic discussions .
Let head reason for that be the strategy of the Hungarian corps , that aims probably on the provocation of such a discussion , so the research institute .
How reports , this is looked at as a failure of sides of the politically responsible : `` Persons of the public life left / the discussion of the Romany-question to representatives of radical political grouping , constructed have '' that now its political strategy on the Romany-Hungary-contrast .
One assumes that these intensify the problem , that impossibly make sensible dialogue , extremities favor , as well as the probability of violent discussions increase would become .
The Forschungsinsitut does not mean would have moreover , that activities of the Hungarian corps , finally thanks to the enormous attention of sides of the domestic and foreign media , `` the picture of Hungary abroad considerably damaged , especially what the confidence into the stability and democratic maturity concerns '' .
We remember : Since autumn 2006 the reorganization is of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing so that since summers 2007 several were established itself , `` national self-defense united '' naming organizations .
`` These groupings is meanly , that it itself respectively as a civil organization define , while it openly therewith boast , its members on - sometimes armed - defense task to prepare ( catastrophe protection , national defense , Ordnungshütung ) , with reference to the unfitness of the police , the army , or the country itself '' , was named it .
And further : That everything happens in accordance with that method , that tries , different to camouflage on the politics unwillingness and party unwillingness of the population being based , political strivings as a middle class initiative .
The emphasis of the civil character and the united form serve emerge could therefore not merely the evasion of juristic hurdles , that in the train of the entry in court - it is at the same time a political strategy .
How the analysis to take is , the activities of the Hungarian corps represent a risikoerhöhenden factor also for the relations with the neighboring states .
`` In the last months the Hungarian corps in several neighboring states was quoted as a potential danger source , sees so many an ultra nationalistic politician of certain neighboring countries in the origin of the Hungarian corps the confirmation of its own Anti-Hungary-politics .
That everything has effects on the political stability of the region '' - was named it .
The foundation of the Hungarian corps is from the viewpoint the research institute no single phenomenon in headquarters-east-Europe , therefore the political risk grew for the total region .
How reports , the activities of the Hungarian corps are with which the Bulgarian national corps comparable , whose foundation in August 2007 was announced by the radical right-wing Bulgarian national union ( BNU ) .
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian corps , the Romany measure riots , that took place in a quarter of Sofia ( Krasna Poljana ) , stood .
The BNU took the occurrences immediately to the occasion to the foundation of the national corps , with which argument that the goal of the organization would be the `` national protection '' .
According to your opinion was remained same in the past 17 years a regular `` gipsy terror '' in Bulgaria noticeable , the country however inactive and indifferent - so Political Capital .
And further : The initiative would have kicked off a violent debate in the Bulgarian public .
How said , the increased risk for ethnic discussions is belaid also through the fact that some Bulgarian Romany-organizations announced to establish its own corps to resistance purposes .
Because the activities of the Hungarian corps until now many resemblances with which the Bulgarian national corps show it is not to be excluded that the Hungarian Romany also , with whom organizing of its own protection react to the threats , it is named in the risk warning report of Political Capital .
Attila Juhász , research director in Political Capital said on inquiry of the message office : The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute .
Annually risk analysis reports would be published , and risikoverändernden tendencies should be recognizable , is informed the public opinion , like in the case through the publication of the risk warning report .

New fears over natural gas dispute between Russia and the Ukraine
A new price dispute smolders between the Ukraine and Russia , what increases the danger , that Russian exports are impaired by fuel to Western Europe .
The largest part of the Russian natural gas exports into the European Union ( EU ) is led through the Ukraine and very exactly is observed every dispute between both nations .
Kiew warned before that that if Moscow increases the price , that it must pay for the natural gas , , it of Russia higher transit fee in calculation place becomes .
An earlier conflict between both countries in the last year reduced deliveries into the EU-countries .
The youngest dispute between Kiew and Moscow happens try at one time , to which the Ukrainian government and the Russian , national gas monopoly Gazprom to reach a unification about that how much must pay the Ukraine for Russian natural gas in 2008 .
According to Gazprom , more must be calculated the Ukraine because the group to pay has arranged up to 50 % in addition for natural gas out of the neighboring Turkmenistan .
Analysts say that this could mean , that the Ukraine 40 % must pay more for the importations of Gazprom .
`` It is important to us , our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in conversations to use '' , said the Secretary of Commerce of the Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters .
`` The self-changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly with our arguments regarding the height of the transit fee [ to Western Europe ] over the Ukraine connected become . ''
In the last large natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiew in January 2006 shortened Gazprom deliveries into the Ukraine .
This led in consequence to a case of the exports to Western Europe , what drove the prices drastically into the height .
Russian gas settles one-quarter of the provision of the European Union .
Russia has the gas occurrence largest worldwide , but much of them remains underdeveloped .
The consequence is that Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other headquarters Asian former Soviet nations .

Gallup locates government crisis
After long stagnating , the number of the Fidesz-sympathizers considerably grew until beginning of December . First of all since 2002 the party controlled reached has the largest basis warehouse , during the approval for the socialists according to Gallup one never existence low point of 13 percent .
At the party faithful voters , the difference falls out thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates clearly : More than two-thirds ( 71 percent ) stand one-fifth ( 20 percent ) approval for the MSZP vis-à-vis .
MDF and SZDSZ lie according to survey under the parliamentary entry hurdle : They come in the total population to two percent .
The amount of the party voters grew in both warehouses by one percent .
In comparison with the last low point , the general economic mood further deteriorated itself - never before was the share of those , that badly '' judge `` expressed the economic situation of the country than , so highly ( 41 percent ) while further 46 percent consider it to be `` rather badly '' .
After hopefuler outlooks in the spring and summer , the families see the variation of its financial situation again more pessimistically .
For the coming year , the majority of the population calculates goes with a further deterioration of the situation ; only one-tenth of an improvement .
A Gallup-survey carried out in December yielded that 71 % of the questioned - a historic highly - the work of the prime minister as `` sooner badly as right '' judged .
Thirteen percent of the questioned have large confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány while the share of the advocates settles 38 percent for Viktor Orbán .
Round 54 % do not trust at all to the head of the government , compared to 27 % mistrust against the party chief of the Fidesz .

Auchan most expensively , Tesco raises by almost one-fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trade zone retained also this year the average price increase of 16 % of the last year , with which difference that it gave this year no increase of the value-added tax .
Article out of Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trade triangle , the price of the usual Christmas basket of the `` Napi '' increased were registered also this year around 16 percent , to be sure in all Hypermärkten price increases of more than 1,000 HOOVES .
After the prices in the groceries markets in the past December `` davongaloppiert '' are , the increase in prices prozentuell did not fall out drastically , compared to the anyway high , earlier exit level .
To be sure it does not influence determined the consumers deterrent that that had paid , for what it in the last year yet far under 9,000 HOOVES , this year once for 10,000 HOOVES available is .
The price of the `` Napi '' shopping basket exceeded the magic 10.000-HUF-Grenze around at least 91 HOOVES in the examined markets .
The highest price amounted to 10,573 HOOVES .
( In 6800 was the price about 6,800 HOOVES ) .
The prices for Unicum and living fish remained almost on preceding year level , strongly climbed are on the other hand the prices for turkey breast fillets , nut and poppy .
Praise for flour and bread gave the data the headquarters statistical office of Hungary corresponded , in Auchan it however 1kg bread roll for 139 Forint .
There was no competition contingent price slump in the product on less than 200 Forint .
Also surprisingly the price of a two liter Coca-Cola returnable bottle of less than 200 Forint was here , therefore the drink cost seized inclusive only 257 HOOVES .
Nevertheless cut off this year in the `` Napi '' shopping basket-comparison Auchan most expensively , and Cora most favorable .
Our calculations yielded that Cora raised the prices in the `` Napi '' shopping basket vis-à-vis the Weihnachtspreisen in the past year by 15 , while Tesco and Auchan respectively around 18 percent .
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the preceding year and the most expensive of the new year amounted to 12 % while the increase between cheapest shopping basket of the past year and most expensive of the running year 21 % settled .
The price climb average amounted to 1,480.00 HOOF .
The average price increase was in the preceding year yet about 1,206.00 Forint , to be sure the value-added increase in taxes became apparent in the praising to last Christmases .
Exactly this process badly encountered the trade : Apparently the department stores were not able to decide so quite , which price margin they should use in the single articles , because the effects of the price increase were unforeseeable on the consumption behavior .
( If the dealer the circulation speed of a product badly plans , can he around essential profits fall in the price margin , that itself after the traffic intensity arranges ) .
Mehwertsteuer contingently fell out the increase in prices of the `` Napi '' shopping basket in the past year so radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 around 1720 Forint , whereas the price difference amounted to merely 844 Forint in the cheapest basket .
Such extreme were not observed this year because the most expensive basket cost more around 1,630.00 Forint , than in the preceding year , and even in the cheapest , there was a price climb of 1,284.00 Forint .
In the comparison both last Christmas seasons a catastrophic price increase , that price of the daily commodities in the Hypermärkten climbed is in less than 20 months around more than 30 percent , appeared .
( This again does not confirm unconditionally the data of the headquarters of statistical office of Hungary : In many reason foods , the statistical office in the period of 12 months assessed a more than 30-percent increase in prices .
So in about next to flour also in wobbling ) .
If one throws however a view into the `` Napi '' shopping basket , this seems in latter almost impossibly because the price level increased the already in the preceding year of expensive product itself in the worst case around hardly more than 10 percent .
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position , than the Eilieferanten - nevertheless could it the drastic price increase on the Multis shift .
In the golden trade triangle , the Hypermärkte do not lament itself ; it is reported running of good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores views not more at all on the prices .
Are shopped out of all large quantity , go durable groceries in palette over the counters .
It gave Wednesday morning in all three department stores endless snakes in the cash when sudden the number of the customers exploded .
To be sure a slighter customer frequency is reported of the country so that many Multis lament themselves at the opinion researchers , they could not reach once the planned revenue , and to be sure not only in groceries , but rather also in persistent consumer goods .

Those are not Warhols boxes
He who connects the term Sweden and wood box , does not think of Ikea , but at Andy Warhol .
Or yet ?
Presently manufactured wood boxes throw dark shadows in Sweden on Warhols work index .
Forgeries are a large part of the ninety-four Brillo-boxes listed there by the `` type Stockholm '' .
After the Swedish newspaper stirred up `` expresses '' some months ago doubt about the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes of the year 1968 , internal investigations in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm conclude now sobering : The six `` Brillo-boxes '' , that the former museum director Pontus Hultén left as a donation to the Moderna Museet 1995 , are copies - and well also the large part of the approximately hundred further Brillo boxes of that `` type Stockholm '' that are on the international art market in circulation .
The prehistory is interlocks , a confusing concatenation more artistic and kuratorischer productions .
Created Warhol in New York 1964 its first `` Brillo-boxes '' , painted wood boxes , that are based `` Brillo '' on the red-blue-white design of the carton of the soap powder .
A display of its work in the Moderna Museet 1968 issued - with Warhols agreement - hundreds of Brillo-boxes out of cardboard : These did not come ( from costs reason ) of Warhol , but rather were delivered directly out of the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik .
It did not concern works of art , but rather around its examples , around bare display items .
Simultaneously Warhol 1968 gave probably the permission let produce some few Brillo-Holzkisten in Sweden , that were not issued to be sure in the Moderna Museet .
Time witness speak now about approximately fifteen boxes , that at that time as authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the label `` type Stockholm '' to right went in into the art story and auction story .
Many an of them obtained on auction more than 100,000 dollars .
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén maintained later falsely , 1968 approximately hundred wood boxes in Sweden had been produced and issued , leave would have the Warhol then to it .
Actually Hulténs were produced 105 boxes first 1990 in Malmö for a display in St. Petersburg .
At this time Warhol was already three years dead .
Lars Byström , boss curator at the Moderna Museet , examined also three next to the six museum own Brillo-boxes out of Swedish private possession , of which two 1968 in Stockholm were prepared : Your press chip disk became first grundiert and sanded , was applied after that white oil paint with a brush .
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 on the other hand does not betray that the color with a painter roll was applied without undercoat directly on the press chip disk - moreover concerns it oil paint , but rather around Acrylfarbe .
Be not reported `` these boxes became of the artist authorizes and should of the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes removes become '' , lets the director of the Moderna Museet , Lars Nittve , : `` If the 'Andy Warhol type Authentication Board ' in New York not to one other end comes , becomes the Moderna Museet the six boxes in its collection as copies/display material classify . ''
Already in July to be sure the Authentication Board announced to investigate the `` heavy accusations '' , that are raised in things of the soap powder-boxes .
Yet since then one wraps himself there into inexorable being quiet .

For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic , the lawyer of the damaged parents , Igor Veleba wants to demand , of the hospital in 12 million crowns compensation plus court costs .
For each of the mothers three million apiece , for the fathers two million apiece and for the children a million apiece .
The hospital offers maximally 200000 for each parents couple .
The legal representative of the hospital , Dostál , is therefore with the proposal Velebas entire and not at all agreed .
We reject lies `` such a proposal , it around a multiple too highly , '' said Dostál after the current negotiation .
To be able to form `` around us however an opinion to this counter-proposal , need we the expert opinion that let generate the opposite side .
We will assess whether it has generally statement value .
We insist however on the view that that should lie for everyone together in the hundred cable transmitter area , '' emphasized Dostál .
The sum should move according to it between 100000 and 200000 crowns for everyone of the four parents .
At the beginning , the family wanted out of for every month , that it had not raised its biological daughter , a million crowns .
For Veleba , an expert opinion , that had acquired the university hospital in Prague Motol for it , served as a base for compensation negotiations .
The parents of the children suffered in the opinion of specialists out of the area psychology and psychiatry psychic damages and stress symptoms in different strength and depth .
The men endured the stress-situation better , also if they saw itself vis-à-vis accusations , it would have the confusion of the new-born prevent can .
The women again manage with the after-effects of the experienced trauma more badly , as well as also with that , what now just expires , Veleba summarized the contents .

The district captain of that ( bohemian-Mährische height ) delivered emerged were the end of October of every family 100000 crowns as a replacement for editions , that is subordinate them through the mistake of the hospital in that to the district .
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are of law because of haftpflichtversichert .
If there is doubt they must grasp to a reserve fund , can apply for only exceptionally it at the carrier aid .
The courts communicated until now concerned comparatively low compensation sum , that determined became sums by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands , exceptionally of million .

All yet openly
If Romey avoided said , it would not hold it a presidency candidate laud to be questioned of a snow man .
Nevertheless declared itself the republican candidate for the presidency last of all ready to stand a debate on YouTube , in which normal voters receive and submit questions on video , in order to send it the candidate .
None of the questions , that on Wednesday evening , the 28 November , raised became , were as laughable as the snow man , the democrats over the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party questioned .
But the questions , and the answers , reflected this time exactly the condition of the republican party , that breaks open into the choices in the next year .
It is not well known , exactly like the makers of CNN , that the debate sometimes support that selected the concerning candidate to showing YouTube Clips .
However in the first half hour of the debate , that was dedicated longest that to a single subject , immigration in the midpoint stood .
The subject is one of the most powerful subjects for republican .
The CNN asked to serve a group of undecided voters a dial if they heard things , that filed them : The television company noted spoke tip of the approval as the candidates exertally over the boundaries .
The sharpest and longest exchange the evenings was between Rudy Giuliani , the national forerunner , and Romney that pushed itself in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire forwards .
To shake off Giuliani tried the call , it had been yielding with respect to illegal immigration when it was mayor of New York .
It attacked accused Romney in that it the former governor of Massachusetts to have adjusted illegal immigrants for work at its house .
Both sat down asked especially violently apart as a questioner whether one of the candidates would support an `` amnesty '' ( the illegals a regular status and the possibility on the country citizenry give would become ) .
More insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter , a Californian congressman , and Tom Tancredo , a congressman out of Colorado , succeeded it in this subject after hook .
None both men has earnest chances in the nomination , but both remain in the race , perhaps because they chopped earlier and more hard than other on the immigration kettledrum .
At least in the area of the immigration , the candidates in the large and entire divide the same views : sharper boundaries , intolerance vis-à-vis illegal migrant .
This subject , together with anxieties over poisonous toy from China or other worries over the remainder of the world , help to forget or to minimize the republicans the differences between liberal and Christian conservative .
But the debate was brought became unambiguously problematically as other subjects the language .
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported weapon restrictions in the past .
John McCain and Romney discussed about whether simulated drowning should be regarded as a torture .
One of the questioner asked whether the candidates believe each word of the Bible .
This in addition that Giuliani represented the standpoint , that although the Bible be preferred keep the books would be , not literally would believe it the story of Jonah and the whale perhaps .
A further questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations on the first place in a survey carried out recently in Iowa thanks to its for some time existing Christian conservativism - said that the death penalty would be painful , but necessary .
When he was pressed on that , whether Jesus would advocate it , he laughed about that and said was Jesus too intelligently around itself around a political office to apply .
The race remains extraordinary far openly .
Huckabees ascent in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls youngest contribution success and its approval storm in the debate of Wednesday .
Both are rocketted out of that nothing because both wing of the party until now not yet on one of the better known and more traditional candidates agree could .
In 1980 and 2000 , a candidate has the party from the beginning and convincing united with a triumphant message over the size of America and a winking to both wings of the party .
The party is split this time and is the result by far not clear .

Expert and politician out of 192 countries advise over the schedule of Bali , in which the emissionsreduzierenden measures are determined for the time after 2012 , therefore at the end of the Kyoto-protocol .
Presently a violent debate between industrialized countries and developing countries in the gear is .
The USA already signaled that they do not want to negotiate over concrete numbers , to be sure they would be ready to reduce until 2020 the greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990 around 25-40 percent .
The other large question of the conference is whether the industrial nations are ready , next to the reduction of the emissions the developing countries both financially and technological to support .
Also an agreement on the support of developing countries was obtained .
That the Kyoto-protocol imputed is supposed to be administered adaptation fund by a 16-headed advice , presumably in the global environment facility ( GEF ) of the UN , like in the `` Piac és profit '' to read about is .
Hungary six percent
Environment minister Gábor Fodor supports the striving of the EU in the name of Hungary to retain its forerunner roll in global climate protection-measures , and to obtain a new international agreement until 2009 .
The minister explained , the EU would not reduce the greenhouse gas emissions until 2020 around 20 % ( measured by the values of 1990 ) , independently of whether that successfully would be obtained according to `` come off 2012 '' , or . The union would be are also ready even ready to advocate a 30-percent reduction , soferne other large industrial nations of the world , and/or developing countries to come later its obligations after powers and responsible .
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the objective of the countries that 1997 had joined the Kyoto-protocol was , a reduction of solely 5.2 percent , whereas the EU with its at that time 15 member countries had promised already to a minus of 8 % .
The specification for Hungary reads reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions around 6 % in comparison with the years 1985-87 - a specification that thoroughly will fulfill the country to read about like in the press release of the environment ministry is .
The use is high on Bali - nevertheless must the long-term international climate political come off within two years be finished , would step otherwise it with security first after 2012 effective . In this case , no renewed , international emission reduction system would follow the reduction intention determined in the Kyoto-protocol , whose meaning also the IPCC that emphasized international , with the Nobel Peace Prize excellent scientific climate change-committee of the UN in its youngest report .
Through it the emission reduction would delay would be itself , and the increase of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2°C unavoidable , what would have according to scientists extremely serious and irreparable consequences as a consequence .

Banks want to master crisis
The American Federal reserve , the European headquarters bank and the headquarters banks of Great Britain , Switzerland and Canada concluded to fight jointly against the crisis on the financial markets .

For example the American Fed sends makes 40 billions of dollar on auction , further 24 it for the European and the Swiss headquarters bank loosely .
It is after the attacks the 11 . September the first time that the headquarters banks of the single countries agree on a so coordinated action to the defense or Abmilderung of the consequences of a finance crisis .
`` This step should remove the largest difficulties of the economy , therefore the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend , '' Bernard Baumohl of the consultation firm wrote Economic Outlook Group in a report for its customers .
`` The coordinated action of the headquarters banks diminished the probability of a recession in the USA of 65 % on about 50 % , '' joined Baumohl in its report thereto .
The banks lost dollars because of not served credit already around 60 billion , above all in the United States .
Analysts expect even further billion losses .
`` `` The headquarters banks must have had really anxiety before that , what can come later yet everything , when to this action decided , '' the chief economist said of SMOOTHED Amro , Kieran Davies .
`` It looks so that the situation is really bad , '' said it further .
The headquarters banks have the fear that if the banks have even heavily access to loans , for its customers credit also more expensively become .
That would diminish the consumption and would fall the American economy into a recession , possibly with effects on the economic growth in the entire world .
The headquarters banks decided in addition after it was not arrive them , that so-called . To layer LIBOR , that Londoner Interbankzinssatz , that is used in the money distribution between banks .
That means that the banks had permanently anxiety to lend itself mutually money , and that although the headquarters banks of the USA , Canada and Great Britain had layered during the autumn its interests rates repeatedly .

On every Czech , a guilt of 84000 crowns falls .
Over the total past year debt-ridden itself the country around more than 111 Miliarden crowns .
`` Until now it seems that we will exceed the boundary thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year of a trillion crown possibly first in 2009 .

If appear should , that the situation changes on the political stage , and the politicians ready its more should to save , could last that until to the year 2010 .
But of such a change , I do not go out noted , '' it .
Guilt grows
The country guilt stems of the guilt of the country government and comes above all of the accumulation of deficits of the country household .
The country guilt becomes financed through treasure directions , national bonds , direct loans or for example through loans of the European investment bank .
The native country indebtedness climbed this year meanwhile on 719.4 billion crowns .

Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi : Voruteile fade
In order to say the truth , I a special fan of the Peugeot never was 206 .
Its handling characteristics were not much valued , one could the quality of the gearshift , the control and also the processing as rather below average designate .
Yet now its successor , the Peugeot 207 is , on the market , and that is better around much .
The Kombi with the label SW is remains me another piece further , and only to revise my opinion .
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of the 207 , I had to complain for example about the too slight head freedom on the rear seat .
There are these troubles now no longer , for the car body of the Kombi is formed so that once two meter men will not suffer .
Quickly further
I go through the interior equipment only shortly in order to not to repeat myself to very .
It concerns a quite gelungenes design where I have only because of the miserable means tunnel of objections .
There I would welcome somewhat more designerische formation where the car makes otherwise a so elegant impression .
The seats are comfortable , and past the times are where we complained possibly about too short seats or head support .
Also the side stop improved itself vis-à-vis that 206 substantially .
One can sense what concerns the room offer , also here the enlarged dimensions of the car body .
In the Kombi , also the already mentioned lack of head freedom is removed .
Suitcase in the trunk
The essential matter at this vehicle is however the cargo space .
I ( also because of the folding rear window ) must that as beladbar very good and space-saving designate .
The cavities are equipped with stop belts , that represent an ideal compromise .
They do not disturb , let themselves auseinanderziehen and hold also heavier objects firmly .
But let 's maintain us over the drawer volume .
It amounts to according to table in the reason equipment 428 liters what in comparison with the competition a rather average value is .
To be sure not in comparison with the vehicle top-selling in the Czech Republic of this class , that Škoda Fabia comboes .
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of the product out of Mladá Boleslav , let 's assess that the Peugeot remains around clearly noticeable 52 liters .
For a foreign country vacation or in the inviting of a baby carriage , this value is already critical .
In order around to emphasize the Positiva , I must mention yet the cargo space entirely flat after the folding down the backs seats or also the very low drawer edge .
120 HP in four rows
Our test vehicle was equipped with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor with Hubraum 1.6 liters and an achievement of 88 kW .
And honestly said , should look a 1600-Kubik-Motor 1600-Kubik-Motor CUBIC 1600-Kubik-Motor MOTOR , that drives a family-Hatchback .
It is soft , has a slight consumption and pulls well away .
If I compare it to its counterpart in Škoda , that causes sometimes , as its exhaust with a rag would be clogged , only can enthuse be I by it .
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this vehicle is not exactly popular .
We must remember however that we tested a well equipped car with a roomy interior and a very good motor .
The basic price of the car with the 1400er gasoline motor in the amount of 329900 crowns concerns yet .
With our motor , it costs from 410900 crowns , what already rather much is .
The equipment Premium of the test vehicle contributes significantly once again with 80000 crowns in addition .
We had to be sure Kopfairbags , automatic air-conditioning , automatic Scheibenwischerauslösung , electric window siphons behind and and ...
So the car costs crowns altogether simple 531900 .
That is a quantity , but add up once the addition equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive in an entirely similar sum .
Therefore the decision remains only which sign one wants to select .

Popular will have opened its 200 credit banks of Monday through Friday 12 hours at the day .
Popular concluded to modernize a large part of its branch .
Altogether 200 therefrom are established in the economy strongest regions of Spain .
For the institute , that operates under the brand name Popular Max , these agencies mean a large milestone .
But also for the remaining Spanish institutes , there Popular as the first bank group represents ventures the leap to extend the opening times of its branch weekdays until 20.30h and to prepare Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h .
The bank group BBVA , that draw lots be reported also the extension of its opening times in the agencies repeatedly , grasped previously yet no definitive decision .
The currently running negotiations of the bank with the labor unions do not seem to aim on a unification , with which 75 % of all branch are closed Saturdays and open for that at a weekday in the afternoon , if for the clientele .
Whether further banks of the new initiative join , that adapts themselves the business opening times , will depend on that experience valued the Popular bank .
And straight that is also the intention that pursues Popular with its project .
It that opening times of that branch to extend is grasp can goal , that based on its situation the kauflustige clientele more independent , smaller and mittelständiger business , but also that of large department stores .
The bank would like to open the new 200 branch places in the course of the coming 18 months because it does not concern new , but rather changed opening times .
For that the bank will reshape the accomodations of those agencies , will adjust that are already in business zones , and it simultaneously the individual customer profile of the different zones .
So the expansion of the opening times is connected with a new room formation of the branch , that distinguishes itself through a more current , more colorful design .
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring would require no larger investments , but would walk with an increased personnel attitude , there a branch now no longer six , but rather eight or nine employees necessary .
The agencies , that will be equipped even with additional accomodations for the KMU , will sell no financial products .
A positive experience for the group
Popular tested its draft already at nine branches in Madrid .
And the experience valued fell out positively , so Ángel Rivero .
The agencies of the streets Bravo Murillo , O´Donell and the Gran Vía were selected for that , what a smart decision seems been be .
Popular leads momentarily ca . 2500 agencies .
And further 60 that operate under the name Mundocredit . These are specialized on immigrant and wise also expanded opening times up , even at Sundays and holidays .
In these branches of PopularMax , the model of the BBVA is not used because that will offer a wide selection of them instead at not finance services for sale .
Wanting for our customers no competition Rivero explains .
With Telefonica , they came provisionally to the unification to sell with the help of of external bank personnel mobile phones .

The problem with the integration of children out of Eastern Europe at britschen schools the case of North Kent illustrates appropriately where the discussions between the domestic and slovak Zuwanderern gradually increase themselves .

It all right make want - or how becomes one for other uninteresting
Stop and go-traffic , the car middle in the allmorgendlichen obstruction .
Out of the radio erklingt a strange melody : The sound of a violin , paired with electronic effects .
I turn the volume more highly .
The speed changes , comes to the previous sounds the bass , and as a real sound jewel a feminine choir .
It is the song `` Wings of Love '' of Zagar , that on MR2 erklingt .
The domestic music scene did not pamper us long time just with qualitative Electropop .
But now one sees even the obstruction differently if one hears at the same time the new album of Zagar .
The appearance of Yonderboi , so many a new and exciting production out of the domestic digital Underground-scene contribute slowly to a variation of the general view , and even if the garage skirt with its Gitarrengequitsche is again `` in '' , the domestic Electropop proves : There is new under the sun .
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs , played itself in the volume Yonderboi before it - perhaps , because a tavern no two pipers endures - began to follow its own way .
The breakthrough with its project ( Zagar ) and its music , the elements out of jazz , Electronic , and pop fuses , created approached was it however first as one with the favor to compose the Soundtrack to a film , at it ( z . B .
`` Szezon '' of Ferenc Török ) .
The formation , that had appeared originally in smaller club , became the wider public first well known , than the magazine „wan2 '' its first album from the year 2002 under the Top 50 domestic albums lined up and Zagar , together with Yonderboi , to the nearly only , also in the west marketable trendsetter kürte .
Doubtless Zagar and its volumes were interested `` trendy '' , it however no whether they carry this sign also gladly .
The volumes reacted , should how it : With a new , even better album .
The now appeared new album with the title `` Can not Walk Fly Instead '' could open them new ways , to be sure the title presses already the wish after continuity with the Pécser years from .
The expression originates namely the time when Balázs Zságer was yet with another volume underway .
The airy , flying allusion would be also in order , to be sure that - the zeitgeist and the trend corresponding - are noticeable next to the ethereal character of the music pure guitar , the influences of the rock'n'roll .
With these songs , that in England living and with the volume `` The Puzzle '' working singers György Ligeti imagined in the premiere in the Millenáris .
A song of the album created it even to the radio pop song - that since newest MR2 sending by early until late pop music set the listeners with the number `` Wings of Love '' , that was received with the assistance of six domestic singers ( `` Underground Divas '' , ) , successive the ear worm .
All in order therefore ( ? ) .
The hvg . hu inquired in Balázs Zságer .
Hvg . hu : This new hit raises the question : Does to what extent layer remain reserve your music of a conscience ?
Balázs Zságer : The concept `` layer music '' does not mean me just much .
According to my opinion it does not give two boxes in the pop music , and to be sure Mainstream and Underground , or alternatively and pop , but rather commercially and honestly .
Even the so-called alternative-music-or-Underground-music can be shallow and meaningless , can produce become just as it however also only for the sale , that makes it to commercial music .
Also a good pop-number can develop from an honest subject .
The reception readiness of the listener functions also after this principle , of languages and country boundary independently .
Hvg . hu : Do you see a difference in the candor of the Hungarian and the foreign public vis-à-vis your music ?
B . Zs . : Abroad , especially west of us , the pop music has a larger tradition .
There not only teenager or Twens go on concerts , but rather also the older public .
They pursue the trends in the pop music that happen around it around , much more attentively because they consider it also to be a part of the contemporary culture .
Hvg . hu : Which roll comes the public to in your work ?
It is hear important , who , where , wieviele your music ?
B . Zs . : It is natural a good feeling , to see that more and more to our concerts come .
We never composed however for the market .
Here the music does not emerge in order to serve a purpose , but rather for a certain reason .
The roll of the public is usually in the concerts noticeably where there is already a mutual interaction , but there is that again only in the intangible variations of the moment .
Nevertheless is been noticeable me one : If you quite want to make it all , you are no longer interesting .
Hvg . hu : How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi ?
It is as a soloist underway and constructed its career sooner in the west .
B . Zs . : We do not go really its way , once therefrom entirely seen that one tries again and again to read into this into our music .
We see ourselves sooner than team Player , that let trust on the musical presence of the other and can be unfolded it .
Originally were natural comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi unavoidable because several of us come out of its volumes and hit another way .
Hvg . hu : In the Charts of MR2 , `` Wings takes precedence of Love '' .
Many heard not until the name Zagar to the connection with this number .
Was the opening with one deliberately produced somewhat more popular style toward a wider public ?
B . Zs . : We had no plans to write a hit , that should serve then as a train horse for the album .
In this song , it concerns more .
It was thought as a finale of the album , with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult subjects .
Hvg . hu : How did you select the six singers ?
Why was just it , what the Leitprinzip ?
B . Zs . : The basic idea was , to make a Gospel-good choir .
Then the idea came to assemble the choir out of gifted soloist of the domestic music scene .
So the six headed choir emerged - therefore Sena , Eden Kutzora , Judie Jay , Bori Péterfy , Hodosi [ Neo ] , Juci Németh - , that we then apäter `` Underground Divas '' baptized have .
Hvg . hu : Did you want to have the song just as , or the girls have it with shape ?
B . Zs . : There was was finished the number already more long in the instrumental version , but as the material for the album , thought we us that this number needs '' yet `` something .
The accord sequence demanded formally after a song voice .
I warmed up the melody yet in the same night , learned later it the girls .
All came practically on attempt and frightening spontaneously .
I can remember , I was galvanizeed at that time rather , but it needed already also the `` Divas '' .
With my voice alone the song never would have become so strong .
Hvg . hu : Both on the disk , and in the concert one had however the impression that would be girl in the background .
There is no solo-part ( seen of the short solo of Judy Jay ) , they have no own roll , sing perfectly together and are not more loudly , than the music , therefore its song not only is accompanied of the music .
Also on the stage , they stood behind .
Is it intention ?
B. Zs . : That they are stood behind , was because of purely technical problems so .
To be sure we wanted to approach let them deliberately no solo-rolls .
In the number , it goes also therefore that one should forget its ego a few , forget , who come from where and is where underway , let we simply to that us these certain wings that wings raise the dear .
I would have gladly that also other sense this euphoric condition , that we sensed , when the song emerged .
Hvg . hu : Which was the costliest song ?
B . Zs . : In the musical Schaffensarbeit actually quite no , it gave sooner more difficult tasks in the mixing .
For example in `` Dorian Gray 's it dilemma '' , in which I play on a concert piano , or in „Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls '' where the Groove not more long wanted to function , but gradually everything joined itself , like in a Puzzle .
Hvg . hu : Which is your favorite number of the new album ?
B . Zs . : That changes with the concerts running and also now that I have the album `` losgelasssen '' .
Presently `` Never The seed '' are it `` prophet Is A Fool '' , `` Escape From The Earth '' and the number .

Bulgaria is presently doubtless the most desired pavement for immobile purchases in the East European room , with favorable ski suite and houses at the sea .
Between the mountains , the regions be are Bansko , Borovec , Pamprovo and Vitosa among the most popular , at the sea Albena , the `` gold coast '' , the `` sun coast '' , and the historic villages Sozopol and Nessebar the Renner , to be sure real estate are all around Kavarna and Balcik also more and more asked .
After estimations of re/Max analysts in Bulgaria widen lure also the country in of early or late investors , expressed indicates so for example Veliko Tarnovo , Gabrovo , Elena , and Triavna , and also that favorable area of Russian more buyer .
The capital Sofia offers also enticing offers - trade areas and office areas offer highest yield .
Bulgaria is on the best way one of the most attractive European golfer paradises to become , and to lure therefore next to the summer season and winter season also in both other seasons tourist .
Foresighted investors shop therefore already now on a large scale , for example all around Bansko .
According to analyst persons who acquire real estate in Bulgaria , also a variation of its life change strive for .
Most buyers are Englishman , however also interested parties come it from France , Belgium , Spain , and more and more from Rumania .
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present while there are in the black sea and in the ski zones predominantly Russian buyers .
It gives three groups of foreign buyers , says Georgij Jankov , regional director of re/Max Bulgaria .
Buy that that want to establish itself either revitalisierte real estate around 50-100,000 Euro , or come down houses around 5-15,000 Euro , that renovate it then itself .
Good involvement and attainability as well as communication possibilities largely are written , but are also the vicinity to a metropolis , businesses and physicians decisively for the buyers .
To the second category , those that are in search of a vacation domicile belong ( Bulgaria became in December under the Top Ten vacation goal of the German listed ) .
Businessmen settle the third group , who invest with the goal of a mittel- until long-term increases in value .
Real estate in the capital become meanwhile running more expensive , contingently through the demand growing always .
Within the EU are gave the immobile prices to be sure in Bulgaria lowest , in the past five years it however a price increase around annually 21 percent .
The increase in prices in the Immobilienpreisen exceeds by far the raising of the salaries .

But its report referred on that that other important inspections correctly were carried out in a random sample by five health authorities .
The head finance inspector examined personnel , that was recruited outside of the countries of the European economic region , in consequence of the attack on the airport of Glasgow .
Bilal Abdullah , 28 , an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley , was arrested at the airport after a terrain vehicle was gone by the doors of the head airport terminal .
It was was burdened one of three physicians , that appeared in October in the Old Bailey in a video transmission , and in connection with the presumed car bomb attack in Great Britain .
It is expected that the national health service in the forefield of the position of foreign colleagues inspections carries out in order to guarantee that these possess the required qualifications , experiences and Autorisierungen in order to work in the united kingdom .
Although the health authorities Disclosure Scotland to the examination of previous conviction indices use , to not to receive ordered the agency over the responsibility these information outside of Great Britain .
The report of the head inspector purports now , next to other recommendations that the board of directors should take up guidelines of the punishment index statement , that helps employers in inspections in different countries .
`` Although we found in some personnel documents of references to these inspections , these became placed not routinely durchgeführt . '' the report firmly .
Looked said would follow joined , the Scottish health authorities before the position with high mass , but thereto to its investigation guidelines : `` Our report shows areas up , in which the system improves will can , over to guarantee , that exact information about the amount of the foreign health service colleagues to the decree stand .

Of Beust , criticism harvests for Olympia-refusal
The moving away of the mayor of the applications Hamburg for Olympic summer games is bumped in politics and economy into violent criticism .
Many want to fight further for the games at the water .
Yet of Beust , realism reminds in the estimation of the chances .
The principal director of the chambers Hamburg , Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz , designated on Wednesday a renunciation as `` not well for the economy location '' .
No other project had unfolded most recently so large motivation powers in the city like the Olympiaidee .
`` Without this goal would become the sport political momentum not in the same mass maintain will can . ''
Schmidt-Trenz did not demand the senate in addition up to bury the project , but rather to find a new long-term extension for that , `` that of a changed time ray goes out '' .
Mayor oil of Beust remained on Wednesday in earlier statements according to what the Olympiaambitionen Hamburg would be unrealistic at least to the year 2028 .
`` Not Hamburg decides over an Olympiabewerbung , but rather the German Olympic sports league '' , said of Beust WORLD ONLINE .
It referred expected decision of the sports league to that for beginning of December over an application Munich for the winter games 2018 .
`` This preference means for us , that we in that previously of us angedachten period until 2028 no realistic chances have become . ''
Nevertheless let the dream be not for all time from dream , said of Beust .
The Hamburger sports league ( HSB ) regretted the statements of Beusts .
Through it the impression would be awaked that Hamburg wants to apply itself in the next 25 years no longer for Olympic games .
`` It is too early , itself a chance to build in , in that one the plans already at this time buries '' , said HSB-Präsident Günter Ploß on Wednesday .
A renunciation of the application contradicts moreover the statements of the senate boss on the occasion of a reception to the plenary assembly of the general German of university sport association .
There had not designated the applications Hamburg of Beust for the Universiade 2015 `` as a replacement '' for Olympic games in Hamburg .
The university sport association had nominated not until the past week Hamburg as an applicant city .
The SPD citizenry parliamentary group reproached the senate to not to have used valuable time for the residential construction in Hamburg .
`` The development of the small Grasbrooks is of the senate for years delays become , because it on the card Olympia set and the residential construction excluded has '' , said the SPD-delegate Carola Veit and Jan Quast .
While the SPD had demanded for the small Grasbrook always an integrated planning for Olympia and a later Wohnnutzung , the Christian Democratic Union had set unilaterally on the `` Event-factor '' .
The application for the Olympic summer games 2012 had released a large enthusiasm in Hamburg at that time .
Hamburg was failed to be sure due to Leipzig .

Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With `` The Hunting party '' and `` homicidal peace '' , again two films with the Balkan Peninsula war busy themselves .
Yet both do not convince .
Either the drafts set too much on Action and Geballer or however it are too sentimental .
There also Richard Gere in `` The Hunting party '' can not help .
The good message first : To be sure the war criminals hide themselves Karadzic and Mladic still in the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula , but calculated there , in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnia-war , was regained now the actor Richard Gere .
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighties years finally out of the eyes because all too many nicely-insignificant rolls in Wohlfühlfilmen expelled for women and all too many press conferences to the subject of buddhism one the desire on Hinsehen .
Is now Richard Gere itself sudden the most important argument , `` The Hunting party - if the hunters to the hunted becomes '' must be ( why film title today actually always so long and confused like engineer-tariff agreements ? ) perhaps yet to look at .
It delivers one wonderfully augenzwinkernde representation : In the reason taken is its war reporter Simon Hunt that what would have been able to become out of Gere , if the fate and the film industry were not so gracious : A man , who has its very best times long behind itself , the remainder yet considerable however even as ruins same monument its decline of the former charm preserved has .
But in spite of this trump , `` The Hunting party '' continues together with the German production `` homicidal peace '' that starts also in this week , only the endless row of failed Balkan Peninsula war-films .
With `` homicidal peace '' , one can make short process : The film is rescue about two German soldier in the Kosovo ( Adrian Topol , Max Riemelt ) , the one Serbin before kosovarischen sniper whereon the one falls in love promptly also yet with it .
Although it is begrüßenswert , that here once the Serben are not represented as an exclusive root of all evil , the TV flat film loses itself all too quickly in Geballer and Action .
It remains a type `` alarm for Cobra 11 '' without freeway however for that with war .
On the other hand can be investigated at `` The Hunting party '' quite in an exemplary manner why there was actually never a correctly good Balkan Peninsula war film .
The story of three US war reporters that open itself to track around the Serbian waiter war criminal `` the fox '' down , would have been able to become other director and one with one other script author ( both in personnel union Richard Shepard ) another time perhaps a new `` Apocalypse Now '' .
For the stories are alike astonishing : Both times go small teams into the forest in order to complete something , what the military can not and both times becomes it a trip into the insanity .
One of the reasons for the failure of `` The Hunting party '' is that one does not let be Simon Hunt simple the come down cynic with heart , when that he is introduced us at the beginning .
No , the Script must impute in addition another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to it .
Finally `` The Hunting party '' goes then the stream down if the reporter within the last five minutes in the Zeitrafferverfahren that succeeds , what Nato , CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years did not create : The war criminal catch and leave the Muslim Bosniern to the just revenge .
That is so bad that one would like to call the international court in the Hague because of crime against the movie theater logic .
At the same time the film has a deeply human concern .
It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic yet always freely run around , and it suspects to not to operate the Americans and the Frenchmen ( here should it itself exceptionally once united be ) the pursuit based on secret political arrangements all too intensively .
But the good meant and that are angry itself sometimes so similar that one a famous breaks-poem comes into the sense .
Therein it is named over the wood costume of an Asian demon on the working table of the poet : `` Sympathetic I see the swollen forehead veins , indicating : like strenuous it is , badly to its '' .
Film like `` The Hunting party '' such threshold heads that indicate however have exactly how strenuous it is , to be good .
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan Peninsula war film .
Recently is would report become in this newspaper that all Iraq-films were flops large Hollywood .
One can add : There was also never a good South Africa-film .
Almost always counts : If a star gads itself on the trouble spot or mine fields of the world , comes so somewhat at the same time out like `` Rangoon '' with Patricia Arquette , `` hereafter of all boundaries '' with Angelina Jolie or `` blood diamonds '' with Leonardo DiCaprio .
Possibly all the conflicts are temporally simply yet too near .
Decades had to pass nevertheless before Hollywood with `` Schindlers list '' was able to turn a good film over the Holocaust .
Many a film becomes well yet ripe - the Vietnam-works valid now as classic `` The deer Hunter '' , `` Apocalypse Now '' or `` abundance Metal jacket '' were celebrated at that time in no way unanimously as master works .
But perhaps we know today where every measure murders in real time on immediately two screens at home comes , also simply too much over the conflicts of the world .
And that steals the script clerks the Bedenkenlosigkeit that needs it in order to tell good stories .
`` Are or became not ware '' or `` the large dictator '' in the end also therefore so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet , how badly the Nazi regime really ruled .
Perhaps one may not be good want if one wants to make good films .
Perhaps one must have the sarcastic dissociated artist view of the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk .
When that was questioned to parallels between its historic novel `` Lemprières dictionary '' and the Balkan Peninsula war , it answered : `` That lies only that some things never change .
Metropolises will be always terribly dangerous , persons will be murdered always in horrifying manner and always will rule war in Yugoslavia . ''

Polívka came around its kingdom Walachei

Polívka did not take today part at the negotiation .
According to its lawyer the thing not therewith however probably is concluded and will insert its client probably calling .
`` The dispute goes therefore that Mr. Harabiš and be parasitical participate want team at the popularity Bolek Polívkas , '' said after the negotiation Polívkas lawyer .

Lucrative business
The court according to used Polívka the label `` Walachischer king '' for the first time in one of its telecasts .
1993 krönte it the actors Radoslav Brzobohatý .
That did not hold together however at that time with the intention to establish a fictional kingdom .
A few years later Harabi cameš on the thought , to issue walachische passports .
Out of an originally amusing action crystallized itself a business and an entrepreneurial activity out , at which Harabi connectedš then the foundation of the firm `` Walachisches kingdom '' .
Polívka of the use agreed 1997 its by the name of and its signature in the passports and offered even reductions in the visit of its farm and its theater presentations to its owners .
Who will sit on the throne ?
The judge cited today also that Harabi usedš only the bare idea , that had made Polívka in the shipment `` arena '' for its entrepreneurial intentions public .
`` The popularity Polívkas certainly helped the project of the walachischen kingdom , '' said the judge .
It added however that the soul of the project Harabiš and be would be team , that intensively would have dedicated itself it .
The collaboration of the parties disunited today lasted to the year 2000 when Harabi organizedš for Polívka in Vsetín the official culmination .
Since then however began to heap itself between Polívka and Harabiš the disputes , selected culminated that in the dismissal `` king Boleslavs 1ST to the saint-Nimmerleins-day '' .
The leadership role used then on stimulation Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother .
2002 Polívka against Harabi submitted thenš and its firm the complaint , that rejected the court today .
Clarity in the dispute could bring that of Harabiš prepared contest around the throne and a half princess .
From that a new king should follow .
It did not want to betray details and an appointment yet .
`` We want to rush nothing .
It should be so something like the king move in the Walachei .
The king should be selected for a certain time .
Also Mr. Polívka quietly can register at the same time , joined '' Harabiš thereto .

The fathers of the herb skirt return
Germany super group of the seventies plays again : The three volume members of harmoniums planned its console in a concert in Berlin again .
To the Revival , a with cut appears out of its large time `` live 1974 '' .
Already at that time they were abroad substantially more famous .
The anberaumte sensation happens then in shape of threefold set gentlemen at the evening chalkboard .
Everyone has its box before itself , its cables and above all its buttons .
Dieter Moebius thrones shirt in the blossom knowledge at 63 years of age in the middle .
To the left flanks of Michael Rother , 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar .
To the right , of the auditorium out of observes , crooks itself Hans-Joachim Roedelius , 73 , concentrates at the console .
Everyone contributes sounds , sometimes even a Beat .
And sometimes it joins itself mistakenly to a conventional piece music .
That seems to disturb then also the gentlemen even not largely .
That the volumes harmoniums plays again , provided under herb skirt-lover for some excitement .
Whereby one may reveal here : Aimed demands yielded that the name buzzed to be sure through the collective pop memory , but to have missed in no way so persistently , around these volumes for 32 years painful .
But why should its living legends not celebrate may also the German out of the seventies ?
Especially since that counted what is named misleading herb skirt , in England and America always more than in the own country .
When the music economy lent the surviving of the Cologne group Can 2003 the echo-price for the life work , one saw in the hall into asking German pop faces .
When the speech Hot Chili Peppers itself in the Laudatio also yet in the volume La Dusseldorf , and newly ! thanked , knew the surprise no boundaries .
In concerts , Michael Rother squatted later in the speeches Hot Chili Peppers on the stage such as an old buddy .
The problem of the ignorance home and the Verklärung in the strange the one is .
The memory is overcharged already therefore with harmoniums because that trios only two years was shown existed and in this time also a far slighter effect power unfolded than them retroactively by others .
Moebius and Roedelius had played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler already before under the much promising name cluster .
First of all one played stage in the cellar under the Berliner .
After that in Dusseldorf , for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church .
Rother had assisted shortly in power plant and following as a guitarist in newly ! , the group most radical German at that time perhaps , a call erspielt .
Around 1973 , Rother followed to be sure the cluster-musician into the exile after forest in the Weser mountain country .
There , in the old Weser yard , a ruin out of the 16th century , lived it as a city fleeting Kommunarden .
Fewer ideologically than in the community I where Roedelius was allowed to toil yet as a child girl .
Sooner in spitzweghaftem artist existence .
Nominally also a pennant of the song united harmonium Ottenstein and for the art a name was found in the barrier rubbish .
A lot held harmoniums therefrom .
The first album was named `` music of harmoniums '' and the following `` de Luxe '' .
For so let and sounded modest the music also , led the volumes material need .
The Reisigsammeln did not serve alone the even establishment .
The CD appeared now `` live 1974 '' became in a concert in Griessem with cutting edge , before a nearly 50-headed record scenery how someone believes to remember .
Of Rother , the wish came at that time to force harmoniums and to practice occasionally .
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand .
The volumes its separation explained 1975 .
Rother landed in the esoterically-spherical and secured itself its existence with albums such as `` flaming heart '' .
Cluster was animated in the eighties again and is ever was since then more successfully , than it harmoniums .
The Griessemer live album is to be owed Herbert Grönemeyer .
Whose record company Greenland it sat down to the goal to maintain the herb skirt as an inherent German contribution to the living music .
New ! became at the same time already from ditch such as Roedelius solo work .
The physical resurrection of harmoniums takes place house of the cultures of the world in the Berliner .
Publicly subsidizes , in the frame of the festival Woldtronics .
Julian Cope is there , the Briton , Altpunk and author of the handbook `` herb skirt Sampler '' .
There also the Loveparade-inventor is Dr. moth .
Wherewith the total bandwidth of the influences of the herb skirt would be outlined on the following pop music .
Of harmoniums , the empty place of the super group is filled out at the same time .
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar Sounds in the hall : `` The single true music , you belong the future . ''
There are pictures that show the maker with harmoniums in the farmer parlor .
The Legendbildung serve projection of further white photos of confused cabled device shafts .
Before that the three veterans are handled again with the improvisation .
In that they glue microphones at the organ and at the percussion , in order to elicit the instruments tones shocking over even done handicrafts effect devices .
Today the electronic music such as electronic music looks .
Three into the technical deepened Tüftler .
On that also the choir of the house changes nothing .
Under the direction Barbara of morning star is coughed under Soundwolken and gewispert and at a beautiful place with emphasis `` Aaaaaaaah ! '' sung .
Herb skirt was always a very English concept .
It never concerned skirt .
The roots were sought fewer in the blues , than in music university ( Can ) , technologies ( power plant ) or on the flight from artistic and social conventions ( clusters ) .
Who here `` '68 ! `` calls , has let not very wrongly bring , and harmoniums itself therefrom also now not out of the quiet .
Yet the most obvious thoroughly is roofed on the stage .
Where does music begin and when it stops ?
That can steal one the nerves or can give fleeting moments of large good fortune .

Does the credit crisis of America credit card market infect ?
If blood is in the water , it is is excited only natural , that dorsal fins around turbulence .
Now where America real-estate market kränkelt , have the carnivores the credit card market of the country in the visor .
Analysts of Goldman special it calculate therewith that the credit card losses 99 could reach billions of dollar , if the contagion danger of unterfinanzierten credit spreads itself on other forms of consumption credit .
Signs of the strain are clearly visible .
There are climbs both in the from entries and in the delay rates , that measure the share of the credit , that are too late respectively not retractable or more than 30 days .
The HSBC announced in the last month that it took a 1.4 billion of dollar fee elevation out of its American consumer financings , partially because of the weakness of Kreditkartennehmern .
It is nevertheless too early in order to decayed in panic .
Losses and delays are still low .
Loud the Ratingagentur Moody was the Drittquartals-Säumnissrate of 3,89 % nearly a full point under the historic average .
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors .
A change in the American private insolvency right laws in 2005 did not lead would increase to an abrupt case of bankruptcy registrations , that settle again for a large part of the Keditkartenverluste ; the amount of the registrations ( and therewith delay fee ) again whether the general conditions deteriorate themselves for borrower or .
The industry reports also of solid payment rates , that show , how much of its guilt the consumers pay off every month
And the confidence into kreditkartenbasierte securities is rather strong , in spite of the standstill in other corners of the structured financing .
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup , one research enterprising , calculates therewith that the edition quantities will be 25 % higher for 2007 last of all than a last year .
There are direct infection canals between the immobile credit crisis and the credit card market certainly : it is more probable that consumers receive credit card guilt , now that own home credit dry up .
The card issuers view however on the money river instead of on capital value , therefore falling house prices do not solve of necessity a change in the credit worthiness of the borrower from .
They can be even for the card issuers of advantage .
The stimuli for consumer to pay the mortgage rate further , sink become if the real estate less value are than the value of the loan ; as a result the card guilt under the repayment priorities more importantly .
Card issuers can react also much more quickly and more flexibly than a lender to the stormier conditions in that they change interests rates or credit boundary .
That should reduce theoretically the risk of a fast reappraisal of the assets .
`` We not one day will wake up and the loans totally newly value '' , says Gary perl , Capital Ones head finance advisor .
Even if a sudden lower cover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely , the risks of a persistent downswing are considerably more real .
If lower house prices and a credit reduction America press into the recession , the industry will stand undoubtedly before a grimmer future .
They keep a far lookout for these shark fins .

Six deterrent small things , annoy around teammates
E-mails which we forget to send , language news which we never receive -- harmless lies which we do n't notice any more : You take `` color '' at work to the weekday .
The question is , whether one himself to mere one used , or what puts this small trouble for himself consciously of the challenge and temptedly this misunderstandable , aggravating for other situations to vermweiden better .
Tips .
`` Sorry , I have forgotten to pass on to you that somebody of the marketing department has called '' -- a colleague says .
That one has missed a meeting through this ?
At best one is sorry for and tries to line it up to make up by perhaps calling with the marketing department and confessing remorsefully one would have forgotten for the message ( this is the less usual method ) .
The thing is dismissed with an excuse mostly .
With what can and try to avoid these situations consciously one prepare moments really unpleasant his colleagues before one becomes entangled in embarrassing excuses , if one should think it over ?
What does n't to one belong himself , lent something ?
There is hardly something more sinewy as if one reaches for a document , office accessories or the telephone but it is n't here .
The stapler lay on the desk still yesterday -- is it gone this morning ?
Or is approximately the ballpoint pen believed lost discovered on the desk of a colleague ?
One should borrow nothing from the colleagues without wonder because annoys they are if they notice that something has got away .
So not putting any envelope or mail its from the office into the bag because they could meet one : no-one more there , if one needs it urgently anyway .
Gossip about the private life of the colleagues ?
There is not to hold back any effective means , a gossip which was already put into the world .
Who with whom , what done ?
Where and why ?
The information ( or assumptions ) should n't one everybody about the private life of the colleagues if possible tie to the nose !
And if somebody opens anyway and his innermost secret betrays us , we should n't abuse this confidence !
One is silent like a grave instead of , at all , not passing on this one to persons present even if others know also about the problems of the colleague at the best .
Reported without reason illy ?
If one calls in the office to report under reference to tormenting headaches illy because one just feels unwell or simply only would like to rest , one should himself about one be in the clear one : The colleagues must finish the work of their own , nondeferrable handlings , projects with firm appointments instead of one now themselves .
Join in in the colleagues therefore not bad !
One knows already on the day before that one wo n't make it to the office the next day or that something could come between , why one must have left at home , if one should report it on time , so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are confronted with the absence unexpectedly if .
Gesumme , giggling , make a telephone call
One is just deepened in his work , however , is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of the colleagues ?
Listened in unintentionally on a telephone call which one would n't have been supposed to hear better ?
One should n't irritate the colleagues with buzzing , singing , loud conversations ( which one holds away over their heads ) , trampling , getting angry constantly or grumbling .
All this can be very disturbing even if are not just in a task ( write she plan , organize ) recessed .
Are the others always to blame ?
If a project is n't ready in due time , one has an important letter or important Nachrichte forget to send off , one should n't look for the fault of the forgetfulness of one 's own at other !
If possible one should n't finish himself speaking on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues !
One admits his faults to himself and apologizes best if others also were concerned by it !
Can make up the question like one mistakes make up for it or this , you attach only too missed !
In the office , a feeling like at home ?
Track-suit trousers and Schlapfen : Has lost nothing in the office comfortable for at home , however !
Once , one should n't then dress so casually if the job would allow it actually !
Get -- alone on the whole one should respect both his colleagues and himself that one dresses in the office correspondingly -- merely not too sloppy if desired , also pretty and elegant !

Everything still open
Mitt Romey said it does n't regard one as candidates for the presidency worthily to be , questioned by a snowman .
The republican candidate nevertheless declared himself the presidency in the end ready to face a debate on YouTube in which normal voters on video take and submit questions to send it to the candidate .
Nones of the questions which were raised on the Wednesday evening , November 28th , were as ridiculous as the snowman which questioned democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party .
But the questions and the answers reflected exactly the condition of the republican party this time which bursts in the elections next year .
It is n't known , exact like the producers of CNNs which selected the debate YouTube supported co-to be shown these to the prospective candidates clips .
This one was dedicated to a single topic , Immigration was in the center however in the first half hour of the debate , the longest .
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for republicans .
The CNNs asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial if they heard things which they liked : The television organization noticed tops of the consent as the candidates strictly spoke about the limits .
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was in Iowa between Rudy Giuliani , the national forerunner and Romney , the surveys making up their mind in this one , and has shoved New Hampshire forwards .
Giuliani tries to shake the reputation off , it has been soft with regard to illegal Immigration when it was a mayor of New York .
He attacked Romney to have it hired the former governor immigrants who are accused by Massachusetts and illegal in this for work on its house .
The two sat down particularly intensely from each other as questioners wondered whether one of the candidates would support an `` amnesty '' ( which would give illegal a regular status and the possibility on the citizenship ) .
More insignificant candidates like Duncan Hunter , a Californian convention representative , and Tom Tancredo , a convention representative from Colorado , it turned out well for this nachzuhaken topic .
Neither of the two men has grave chances at the nomination but both remain in the running perhaps because they have hit on the Immigrationspauke earlier and harder than other .
The candidates share the same views at least in the area of the immigration in the great and whole : sharper limits , intolerance opposite illegal Migranten .
This topic helping the republicans together with fears over poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world to forget or to minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives .
But the debate was were brought up obviously problematically as other topics .
Mr Giuliani was asked why he has supported weapon restrictions in the past .
John McCain and Romney discussed it whether you should regard as a torture drown feigned .
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe the Bible every word .
This was the reason that Giuliani supported the point of view that although the Bible is its preferential book , it perhaps literally does n't believe the story of Jonah and the whale .
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
Mike Huckabee , Christian conservatism existing for a long time contrary to all expectations on the first place in a survey in Iowa recently carried out thanks to his now , said that the death penalty is painful but necessary .
You pressed he laughed about it as him Jesus had too intelligently to be advertised around himself around a political office , whether Jesus would approve her , and said .
The running remains extremely wide open .
Huckabees advancement in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul 's latest donation successes and its approval storms in the debate of Wednesday .
These two have very shot from the trifle because , till now , the both wings of the party could n't agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates yet .
In the year 1980 and 2000 a candidate has reconciled the party from the beginning and convincing with a victorious message about the size of America and a blinking to both wings of the party .
The party is split this time and the result by far is n't clear .

Is a final annual Rally for the stock exchange still to come ? Disagreement with the experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks up to the annual accounts of the stock exchange the investors already rub their hands with regard to the coming final annual Rally .
The experts regarding this nevertheless can not make any sure forecasts .
Banif thinks that ? looks purely statistically , the month is usually accompanied by a positive market trend at the stock exchange Decembers
It nevertheless is n't advisable to make forecasts of statistics at short notice and only on the basis . Tensions to be taken if serious do n't determine the current market event primarily then
Although other experts do n't approve of a such firm rise in prices within the last weeks of the year these say nevertheless that the stock exchange quotation is certainly liquidity of the market and the market participant given the of ? . These invest mainly in fixed-interest funds due to the lack of safe share funds , which is concerned by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend towards productive assets strongly .
The stock exchange will therefore rather show a course trend in opinion of these experts which is rather lateral and influenced by market fluctuations , ? primarily because we can not assess the extents of the possible fall in the interest rate of the U.S. central bank yet , an uncertainty these primarily on the increased crude oil price and to lead the danger of the increase in the rate of inflation back is .
Javier Barrio , chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain , agrees , that with that it is a daring time to announce a forthcoming market Rally .
The chances do n't stand the expert insures ? ? , very well .
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4 % since its maximum brand on November 8th from 15,945.7 points .
But all experts do n't share the same negative opinion .
In opinion of Juan Solana , analyst at Intermoney , the Ibex 35 could , the year successfully with almost 16,000 points complete because of the restructuring of the investment funds and the subsidizing of the pension register which is traditional and carried out around this time every year .
The expert nevertheless stresses that the things could develop this year a little differently ; primarily due to the final annual Rally taking place already in the second December week and therefore directly after the bridge day to the day of the constitution .
In opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations would n't influence the market trends .
The previous judgements are to the market situation on an almost technical standard , in the opinion of Federico Olucha , analyst at the bench Inversis , what could lead , that a deviation of the index values could stand out soon , the extents depended on the results of the U.S. mortgage market crisis .
The analyst trusts , that on this these turn out positive .
At the choice of the values which shall advance the Ibex to new maximum amounts the analysts agree .
Solana of Intermoney declares that it is ? this year the great values ' turn .
The expert would count the two big banks and some property companies as one of the value winners , ? the current sector will be too expensive at the given time there .
Assure Federico Olucha of the bench Inversis meanwhile that the increases in connection with the bank and industry sector will walk along .
If the Rally actually happens , the property companies will profit from it .
The ACS was on on fetching course within the last months and we hope that other property companies like Ferrovial and FCC take the same way ? , so the expert .
Periodical consumption will determine the market event with regard to the increased consumerism during the Christmas Days in the last half year .
On the other hand the expert thinks that the technologies also will achieve positive sales results even if they are represented on the Spanish market only in a low number .
Five times within seven years
Within the last seven years December showed sinking developments of course only in two cases .
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003 , this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and this one initiated a last real final annual rally simultaneously till now .
December showed a rise in prices of 6.68 % this year in which the Ibex 35 made up time by 28.17 percentage points .
2008 in consequence becomes the fifth profitable year the Ibex ( has ) increased by 8.36 % since January and can produce an Endjahresrally also , will let itself be seen whether .

My family doctor presents me one of his long , strange research articles with the title : Money leads to activation of certain brain areas primarily if the other get more of this ? .
Therefore the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of the colleagues .
The study was prepared with the help of a tomographisch magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last issue of the science magazine Science .
The activation was the strongest then if the participant gave correct answers and his con-player , however , failed according to statement Bernd of Weber , author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life & Brain ? .
The researchers could recognize that the brain activities always turned out very moderate when both participants were with their answer right and therefore also got the same salary ; but if one got the double from them , it also added to a stronger brain activity .
I am not quite sure whether it requires actually so much scientific effort to reach such a result .

Food at a European inflation
The food prices increasing rapidly are main reason for the increase measured in the euro zone in the inflation .
The price increase was in the 13 countries of the euro zone more highly than expected in November -- after the 2.6 per cent in October an annual rate of inflation of 3.1 per cent was registered as the statistical office of the EU reports in Luxembourg .
Bloomberg reported official forecasts have started out from only 3 per cent .
Unlike the American , British and Canadian central bank the European Central Bank ( ECB ) has n't lowered the Leitzsins . In your estimation the cut in interest rates would become the increasing commodity prices of and the slight fall in unemployment favor the emergence of an inflationary spiral .
The ECB endeavors to keep the rate of inflation pressed for the two per cent brand less than two per cent or at least .
The ECB is according to an analyst in the doublemill : One must `` arrange '' the inflation to exclude later need for action .
With 3.3 per cent the rate of inflation achieved a twelve annual record high in Germany in November ; the rate of 3.6 to 4.1 per cent climbed in Spain .
The increased food and prices of energy are responsible for the increase in the inflation in the euro zone .
The MATIF wheat listings increased by 88 per cent and the course for soybeans also achieved a record high since 1973 .
There was a considerable price increase in 2007. also at edible oil and dairy products
The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 per cent this year -- last month the price per barrel of the black gold reached almost 100 U.S. dollars .
According to the ECB the inflation will increase 2008 from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in the year , one expects a fall on 1.9 per cent in 2009 , though .
For the next 3-4 months analysts start out from a 3 per cent rate of inflation , however , estimate the annual average rate with 2.1 per cent .
For 2008 experts expect that the ECB will lower the interest twice .

Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal reserve and the European central bank of Great Britain , the Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight against the crisis together on the finance markets .
So more than 100 billion dollars will reach the currency markets with the help of auctions .
On these auctions the banks auction interest rates at which they are ready to lend each other money .
The American Fed for example sends 40 billion dollars on auction , it forks further 24 out for the European and the Swiss Central Bank .
It is after the stops of September 11th the first time that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinate procedure for the defense or Abmilderung of the results of a financial crisis .
This step shall remove the greatest difficulties of the economy `` therefore '' the increasing lack of freely available capital which the banks can award Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report for his customers .
`` The coordinate action of the central banks '' has , Baumohl added in its report to do the probability of a recession in the USA from 65 % to about 50 % reduced .
The banks have already lost by 60 billion dollars because of not used loans primarily in the United States .
Analysts expect even further billion losses .
`` The central banks really must have been afraid of it `` , what still everything can follow when procedures decided on it `` the chief economist of ABN Amro , Kieran Davies , said .
`` It looks so that the situation is really bad '' , he further said .
The central banks have the fears , that if the banks have access to loans themselves , loans also get more expensive for their customers .
This would reduce consumption and throw the American economy into a recession possibly with effects on the economic growth in the whole world .
The central banks have decided after they had n't succeeded , the so-called LIBOR abzusenken , the Londoner interbank interest rate which is used between banks at the financial rental company .
This means that the banks were permanently afraid to lend each other money and this although their interest rates had abgesenkt for the central banks of the USA , Canada and Great Britain during the fall repeatedly .
`` This will have the same effect as another lowering of the interest rates '' , told Greg Salvaggio of tense to Consulting of the agency of Reuter .
Some analysts are the opinion that this step of the central banks towards the on-heating of the crisis contributes because it does n't solve the fundamental problem and to be more precise the case of the property market in the USA .

The climate on Venus could have a view of the future of the earth recognized
Perhaps Venus was once a pleasant place for the life , scientists said yesterday .
Data of one on an orbit of a situated European spaceship show it was when till now conscious that the planet is like a twin of the earth turned away still more .
Venus is the sewing Estonian planetary neighbor of the earth .
The two worlds have approximately the same size and have similar planetary orbits , is a little closer to Venus of the sun , though .
In front of billions of years had there been conditions on Venus , which would have been very similar on these on the earth and would have been able to even be habitable , think today scientists .
But because of the without breaking carbon dioxide greenhouse effect the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation speed smashed development course Venus unite completely others .
The planet is robbed by water today and a surface temperature which is heiss enough has to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane violent winds and lightning storms .
The knowledge of the space probe Venus express of the European space agency planned this one , for a year this one has examined , offer a look sobering up at it as the earth could develop in view of the disastrous climate changes .
Professor Fred Taylor from the department physics of the University of Oxford , one of the heads the Venus express mission , said : `` It gets clear why the climate is so different to that one of the earth on Venus while the planets otherwise are rather similar . ''
`` Our new data make it possible possibly with a habitable environment to design a scenario in which Venus has started ahead of billions of years like the earth . ''

Cuba , the most beautiful island of the caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of the liberty .
Whatever you expect from your vacation this will be realized if you select only the right thing .
Golden and white beaches , high waves or a sea which is quiet like a pond .
Palms and space including with waiters who offer pizza , ice and beguiling cocktails on the beach .
Kitesurfing , golf and roulette .
You find this in ample measure on the islands of the caribbean .
Only on one the large Antilles you , however , find island still much more and Cuba is this island the great and beautiful .
In the time of the Spaniards Cuba was the bastion for the conquest of America .
It called Columbus the most beautiful place which has seen per a human eye .
Havana cigar turned a store or transit camp of treasures once which the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe .
And then the American epoch came .
The hotel Nacional completely came into being at the end of the 20th century .
One of the bosses of the American mafia , Lucky Luciano , had it because everything which was regarded as a crime in the USA ( particularly during the Prohibition ) was seen and supported with pleasure in Cuba build , drugs , game of chance , prostitution .
Under his guests were and others
Winston Churchill , Ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
Skyscrapers grew into Havana cigar , cars which belonged to the ritual symbols of the fifties of the former Jahrhundets drove over the broad boulevards .
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate for himself in San Francisco de Paula nearby Havana cigars and he had his yacht in Cojímar lie .
Stars of the show business and politicians from all of America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita Del Medio .
And today ?
You also can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana cigar .
One mixes cocktails quite as required for you at the bar in the hotel Nacional .
And the cult cars of the fifties go around to Havana cigar to this day because the Schigulis imported once and Fiats have fallen apart already long ago in the salty and damp air .
One may have come down Havana cigar , particularly his oldest part , strongly , finds as many wonderful colonial sights as straight nowhere in the surroundings here .
Other places are just decorated , for example Trinidad .
The tourism brings money required urgently , there was green light for this development into regard on this , that .
Within the last fifteen years new hotels have n't come into being only into Havana cigar but also in Varadero at the coast of the province Holguín and also on little islands like Cayo Coco , Cayo Guillermo and others .
Cuba still offers a quirk which is unique and attracts primarily railroad enthusiasts in the world .
Steam and diesel operated narrow-gauge railroads took the sugar cane of remote plantations to the sugar factories .
Your fleet of vehicles was n't replaced over decades and one sees there funny and fully operating engines so whose contemporaries are in the museum somewhere else already .
Destinations of the outing
The majority of the visitors of Cuba does n't leave the bedeutendendsten places out .
So one must write no longer in detail about Varadero or Havana cigar .
It only remains to mention that a museum is located in the estate of Hemingway already mentioned whose visit the one who likes this writer should n't miss .
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba .
The luxuriant vegetation grows on chalky soil .
The Mogotas , lime hill and rock , rise steeply of the valley ground , the fertile ground by which also weathered rock areas of a thick vegetation are covered accumulated in their cavities .
It is this valley where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is cultivated .
In his final form you can meet him if you go to one of the cigar factories of Havana cigar .
It possibly seems also interesting to some , that the Chilean result of the television series `` major Zeman '' was turned there .
Trinidad
An ancient town which was founded briefly after the Spaniards had colonized the island .
The trade brought her glory and wealth with slaves and sugar .
The wealth embodied itself in the neat beauty of the little town .
Influences Spanish colonial architecture , strong of the later French settlers , has hardly changed for four hundred years .
Trinidad , is such a remote place that there was n't any street yet in the fifties of the last century there which would have put the area through to the other country , lain between the sea and the Escambray mountains .
This insulation contributed that it remained unnoticed .
Nothing was built there but everybody was glad that he had a roof over the head , torn off from nothing also therefore .
One it more than an afternoon time has , is then worthwhile to look at interesting places in the surroundings for Trinidad if such as the beach playa Ancón or the `` valley of the sugar factories '' .
In the evening one then should go La Música into the Casa de which revives after the darkness and the music is n't where silent up to the morning .
Baracoa
Some completely describe this small towns as the most beautiful of the island in the east of Cuba .
This view also is surely influenced through the way there .
Both streets which lead of Guantánamo there had to and zerküftete mountains overcome and go by a landscape which is hardly touched by human interventions high .
UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its world heir list thanks to the untouched nature there .
The best chocolate is produced there , in the church one shows the cross of Columbus ( in reality it has arisen after the journeys of Columbus ) about one hundred years and of the hill where the former castle , the present hotel tbsp Castillo , stands several table mountains can be seen which El Yunque is the best known .
One could write many pages over the coffee , the rum , the cigars , the Sierra-Maestra mountains , the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos over the Tropicana cabaret , the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad Del Cobre about the Santeria , an African religion which the descendants of slaves confess , over all this .
But as one says so : Looking with eyes of one 's own better .

A deceitful broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Bottomless swindler
So Jerome Kerviel describes his former employee the French bank giant Société Générale owner the local Komercní banka .
She came namely because of him around almost five billion euros .
However , it seems sooner that way , furthermore it for certain was n't incompetent that Kerviel was only a big player which wanted to do it to its colleagues at once .
To the difference compared with all big bank houses he recognized the crisis by the amerikanischenn mortgage market on time .
It `` is '' emotionally rather weak , could be heard from the mouth of its supervisors who reported it to the police .
How these result , from the statements Kerviels Le moons , however , the French media , for example the daily published , he was a man who had made profits in the amount of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year .
Crisis not only in America
`` Everything I wanted had to be earned for my bank money '' , he claims in his statement .
He had managed to earn half a billion euro just at the American crisis in summer .
He had already espied the opportunity of it namely at the beginning of the year .
In February there already was first news about it that which already used , or such as it , installment problems had , are given , would be guessed into difficulties so-called Sub-Prime mortgages low-income customer .
However , influence on the whole economy should n't have this crisis .
Kerviel did n't believe this and was still right .
He had very screwed his profit except for 1.6 billion euros at the end of the year .
Already when I had earned the first half billion I `` did n't '' know how I should declare this Kerviel admits and passes on , that it has kept nothing definitely for itself .
During the whole interrogation he admits that he has falsified documents so that he would the on not come one would creep .
He even succeeded in leading his bosses behind the light even if the Eurex stock exchange was gradually interested in his business .
Risk profit
Feared he to be exposed ?
Welfare hardly .
`` I thought that she satisfies the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billion for the bank . ''
Where did he take the courage to risk so much from ?
He had to work out his position gradually .
In the year 2000 , immediate , he entered the Société Générale after it had completed its studies at the University of Lyon .
His annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollars .
After two years he was already an assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars .
He nevertheless knew that he will never earn much just like other .
`` Already during my first conversation in the year 2005 I knew that one watched me .
Kerviel explained the examination official because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development , `` .
But according to its admission already soon the first great success came .
With the shares of the alliance he earned much by setting euros half a billion at the London bomb attacks on losses on exchange of this title .
And this was the trigger -- he wanted more now .

Special days are n't holidays everywhere
In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exactly so that the practice of changing on the working days has established itself around the holidays by now , the next year grants us less such days , though .
One understands something else also in the EU and in America by `` holiday '' .
The Hungarian right handed system distinguishes between national holidays and days work off .
Days work open are church holidays mostly or are with important historical events in connection .
We also celebrate for example New Year : Both the last day the old and , the first day of the new year , are days work off already -- the latter be able to the New Year 's Eve revelers rest alone with that .
In the whole year we have altogether fourteen holidays .
The national holidays are March 15th which reminds of the revolution of 1848 and October 23rd , the commemoration day of the revolution of 1956 .
On August 20th the state foundation is us our dead bodies on May 1st the work celebratedly , on November 1st and 2nd remember .
Furthermore there are two holidays each at Easter , Pentecost and Christmas .
Since our state , National or religious holidays seldom fall for a weekend , the practice of the `` working day moving '' has proved itself in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday only a day .
It is the price of the extended weekends , though , that we must work very well or go to school on the Saturdays in front of that .
When this day this one fells the holiday , you shall work off at long last , the Labor Secretary is fixing for long years in an ordinance of his own , in front of or after .
The legal provision applies to all employers and recipients , for public employees and officials of the public service similarly .
Only companies and facilities in which the business is continued without interruption that is also on the holidays are excepted .
This year the statement of conditions of employment is only mixed up a little by the holidays at the end of the year : As of December 24th stops in this country really stand since most take vacation lifted especially for it for the days between Christmas and New Year 's Eve time compensation or this one .
Next year more holidays fall to the week middle or until the end of the week so that will give at the working days less Umdisponierungen as this year .
The calendar will around the day of the work `` on the head provided '' , with that be able to stay at home the people at once first for four days of the piece .
April 26th becomes a working day Saturday , this one so that the Friday , May 2nd can be a rest-day .
The second Umdisponierung is connected with the holiday on October 23rd : One will have to work off the Friday , Octobers 24th first of all on Saturday , October 18th .
The end of the year will completely be dominated by the holidays after everything is left and stops as of December 24th even if New Year 's Eve falls on a Wednesday , though .

Gallup locates to governmental crisis
After stagnating for a long time the number of the Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably by the beginning of December . The party has the biggest base camp , lasting the consent first time since 2002 dagewesenen low of 13 per cent has one never reached for the socialists according to the Gallup .
With the party faithful voters the difference turns out clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters : More than two thirds ( 71 per cent ) contrast with a fifth ( 20 per cent ) consent for the MSZP .
MDF and SZDSZ lie according to the survey under the parliamentary entry hurdle : You come up to two per cent in the total population .
The number of party voters has grown by a per cent in the two stores .
In comparison with the last low the general economic atmosphere has further deteriorated , the share of the ones who judge the economic situation of the country when `` really bad '' , so high ( 41 per cent ) , was never before while another 46 per cent regards it as `` rather bad '' .
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer the families see the change of their financial situation more pessimistically once more .
For the next year the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation ; only a tenth starts out from a recovery .
A Gallup survey carried out in December yielded , that the work of the prime minister as `` rather bad when right `` 71 % of the people asked , a historical high , judged .
Thirteen per cent of the people asked have great confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány during which share of the supporters makes up 38 per cent for Viktor Orbán .
About 54 % do n't trust the head of the government at all , compared with 27 % distrust against the party leader of the Fidesz .
One of the indicators of the political atmosphere is the number of the ones who think one could get a grip on the dissatisfaction with the governor also without changes of government .
Today , if 35 % still had voiced in favor of the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government after the disturbances in last October , this share amounts on only still 20 % , while the relative majority ( 33 per cent ) sees the solution only in new elections .
Asked after her interest in the plebiscite 60 per cent answered that it participates `` certainly '' and another 20 % `` probably '' would hand in their vote .
For comparison purposes : if the parliamentary elections would take place on this Sunday , only 55 per cent would go `` certainly '' to the urns , another 15 % regard their participation as `` probable '' . In view of these trends the result of the plebiscite would be foreseeable .
74 % would vote against the hospital day money against the studies charges , 79 % against the practice charges , and 84 % .
At the plebiscite `` certainly '' this one compassionate would become the shares of the opponents of the studies , practice and hospital charges even 81 , 84 or 89 per cent amounts put on on the group .

New fears about natural gas quarrel between Russia and the Ukraine
A new price quarrel burns off slowly what the danger increases between the Ukraine and Russia that Russian exports of fuel are impaired to Western Europe .
The largest portion of the Russian natural gas exports to the European Union ( EU ) is conducted by the Ukraine and every quarrel between the two nations is watched very exactly .
Kiew has warned , that if Moscow increases the price which it must pay for the natural gas , it will bill for higher transit charges of Russia .
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states .
The latest quarrel between Kiew and Moscow happens at a time at which the Ukrainian government and the Russian , state gas monopoly Gazprom try to achieve an agreement about it how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in the year 2008 .
More must be charged to the Ukraine according to the Gazprom since the group has agreed to pay for natural gas up to 50 % in addition from the neighboring Turkmenistan .
Analysts say that this could mean , that 40 % more must pay the Ukraine for the imports of Gazprom .
`` It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during conversations '' , told the Minister of Trade and Commerce to the Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters .
`` The natural gas prices changing should undoubtedly be connected with our arguments regarding the amount of the transit charges [ to Western Europe ] over the Ukraine . ''
In the last great natural gas quarrel between Moscow and Kiew in January 2006 cut Gazprom deliveries to the Ukraine .
This led into consequence to Western Europe what drastically pushed the prices in the height to a case of the exports .
Russian gas agrees on a quarter of the supply for the European Union .
Russia has the worldwide biggest gas deposits but much of this remains underdeveloped .
It is the consequence that Gazprom completes its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations .

Venus is the infernal Gemini of the earth
Venus is more similar than thought till now despite her anti-life atmosphere of the earth : The European space probe `` Venus express '' has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirl to the Pole as it appears also on the earth in winter .
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that there is lightning on Venus .
The European probe `` Venus express '' has furnished the proof now , it tracked down electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere : The lightning on Venus shoots to cloud in a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud , Christopher Russel of the University of California reports in Los Angeles in the science magazine `` Nature '' .
Having let lightning according to the famous `` Ursuppen theory '' arise the life on the earth : Thunderstorms shall have activated reactions in the ocean which led to the formation of amino acids , the constituents of the life .
On Venus not so : Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington `` must , if there ever were lives there , have been it in the very early history '' , explains .
Might give Venus hardly something live on the surface today : The atmosphere is around one hundred times thick than on the earth , there are temperatures of 500 degrees from time to time .
`` Perhaps Venus is the devil Gemini of the earth but she is a Gemini '' , said Russel .
Why Venus who is so similar to the earth in mass and size has smashed a so completely other development is the basic question of the Esa mission .
The start of `` Venus express '' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research since since the beginning of the nineties no more probe was away specifically for the investigation of this planet .
The latest research results which are introduced now in several `` Nature '' articles underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in opinion of the researchers within the solar system .
`` You also show that , with the earth , the things in common of our neighbor planet are greater than at first assumed '' , informs the Esa .
So found cloud whirlpools also unite the researchers besides the already known whirlwind at the North Pole at the South Pole which turns still considerably faster .
A researcher team writes around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica the phenomenon reminds of streams of air on the earthly winter hemisphere .
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost just as big with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers .
The planet also described as a morning or evening star revolves around the sun within almost 225 days .
However , he concerns much more slowly himself : A Venustag lasts for 243 earth days .
Although Venus hardly reminds of the earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure of 92 bar , scientists assume that both planets have arisen under quite similar prerequisites .
Water which remained in oceans on the earth on which Venus was , however , lost to the space accumulated on both .
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on the earth , it agrees on Venus on the large part of the atmosphere .

National debts become very fast on a trillion in the year 2009
A national debt of 84000 crowns is allotted to every Czech .
The complete fault increased on 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September .
The government had planned to get into debt this year with 159.2 billion Konen .
The department reduced the plan , however , thanks to the more positive development of the state Hauhaltspolitik to 152.8 billion at the beginning of December .
The national debts of the Czech Republic climbed 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September .
Within the first nine months of this year they therefore increased by 40.2 billion .
Since June they sank by 13.4 billion , though .
The Treasury confirmed its details on the national debts of the beginning of October with that .
A fault of 84000 crowns is allotted to every Czech .
Over the complete last year the state got into debt around more than 111 Miliarden crowns .
`` Up till now seem that we will exceed the limit of a trillion crowns possibly only in the year 2009 thanks to the lower deficit for the next year .
Next year should move the debts between 900 billion and a trillion crowns , `` David Marek , analyst the Patria Finance , said to the server iHNed.cz .
It looks like Vladimír spade ossa , analyst the Next Finance : `` We could come to the transgression of a trillion in the course of the year 2009 .
When exact it depends on the next household we do n't know this one yet .
If it should turn out that the situation on the political stage changes and the politicians should be ready to save more , this could last up to the year 2010 .
But I do n't start out from such a change he noticed , `` .
Debts grow
The national debt is due to the debts of the state government and comes from the accumulation of deficits of the national budget primarily .
The national debt is financed by treasury bonds , state debentures , direct loans or for example by loans of the European investment bank .
The home national debt increased on 719.4 billion crowns this year meanwhile .
The foreign debts of the state increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion meanwhile .
The so-called marketable national debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and diminished by 13.7 billion since June .
The average due date of the national debts increased to 6.5 years .
`` The complete fault increased by 13 per cent from the first one over the year up to the third quarter , what is really much in view of this one as the economy is well .
It is interesting that growing can be recorded at the debentures primarily where the increase amounts to 20 per cent .
The data it is bad that the debts increase but on the other hand this shows that one can do something already before the reform of pensions comes `` commented on spade ossa .
Better than expected
Dealing with the national debts for 2007 results that the government had planned for this year to take 159.2 billion crowns from the financing strategy and this .
The department reduced the plan , however , thanks to the more positive development of the state Hauhaltspolitik on 152.8 billion crowns at the beginning of December .
This amount is primarily due to the state budget deficit which obviously will reach 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion this year .
The European investment bank in the amount of 1.8 billion further is remedies for the consolidation agency in the amount of 13.3 billion crowns , a ten billion reserve for the payment of the pensions , the financing of state debentures included in one 's plans at most for 43 billion and around rates for the loans .

On Wednesday it did n't come to any agreement about the future status of the province during the last negotiation meeting in Vienna .
At the end the failure
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo have overcome to be able to on Wednesday mornings in Baden , Austria , a sixth and last discussion meeting ended , without their controversies about the future status of the separatist province .
It is ? , that the parties could n't come to any agreement about the status ? , regrettable the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger declared during a press conference in Vienna .
Their obligations to follow for the receipt of the peace and to continue the conversations also until after the end of the negotiations the peace is in the region on stake , the American counterpart invited Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina with emphasis on it , that .
It no acts of violence in immediate future expected but we will be ? ? , it added and indicated that there are thoroughly clear tensions at the beginning of very difficult times .
At the end of the arrangements on December 10th
The mediators of the troika which unites the European Union , the USA and Russia into themselves will meet in Serbia and in Kosovo on Monday a last time .
The future of the province lived in to 90 % Albanian speaking could get clearer if Ischinger , Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane Khartchenko submit their report to the UN security council until December 10th .
The conversations of Baden near Vienna formed the sixth and last negotiation meeting since the troika of last August of UNO had received the order for a new arrangement .
Americans and Europeans expect that their arrangement order on December 10th will end .
The Russians who had already blocked the permission of the independence of Kosovo at the security council insist on a continuation of the negotiations about this end date .
Russia was and remains ? ? , an advocate of a negotiated solution , a conjoint solution Botsane-Khartchenko said .
One-page declaration of independence ?
After Kosovo has been under administration of UNO for eight years , the western countries regard the independence as the only solution under supervision by the EU with future .
Pristina shows itself ready to announce these one-sided if the security council should n't decide in the favor .
Belgrade insists on a stronger autonomy
No agreement could regrettably be made ? ? , the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo , Fatmir Sejdiu , announced , confessed in the hotel in Baden , where since Monday this ? negotiations of the last chance ? you led .
Hashim Thaci , leader of the kosovarischen rebellion and future prime minister of the province more formerly shared the regret .
Added it , however , that the plan to the autonomy suggested by Belgrade is a thing ? of a past which has led to murders and deportations ?
Domino effect ? ?
The Serbian president Boris Tradic thought for his part that a compromise has to be striven always and the Albanian majority warned of the consequences of a one-page declaration of independence of the province from Kosovo .
Belgrade thinks that it particularly a `` domino effect '' in a region fürchet which is still so very weakened by the wars of independence of the nineties .
For Serbia this does n't mean he said ? , that a compromise would be impossible ? , .
On Tuesday the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision is taken only and alone only and alone in the security council where the Russian ally holds a power of veto .
Will the parliament of Kosovo have the last word ? ?
Only a decision from the rows of the security council is acceptable for Serbia ? ? , the Serbian prime minister Vojislav Kostunica declared .
These negotiations have lasted for two years ? .
You must end so as they have started : in the security council .
Fatmir Sejdiu answered the journalists , that ? the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word regarding the status ? , every one-page declaration of independence on the part of the population speaking Albanian and added , that ? in coordination ? go off with the western countries will .

England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemma , each of this almost just as difficult as this other .
Who shall beat as a number 6 for England in Kandy , Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara , at this weekend ?
Not less relevant and , in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka who shall take the decision ?
The second question is important in part-time because it is here David Graveney , the choice chairman , on call at least under this special title to decide to help Michael Vaughan around the boss coach Peter Moores and the captain and because the table of High Morries , the English managing director , fills with applications gradually for national voter offices even for which ones if not .
Who does n't get the sixth thug position always either will be sad but the life is often unjust and it is the sports undoubtedly .
It is never simple branch of profession to nail exactly the top makes a man possible for his to reach while what somebody never gets beyond the lowest rank differently , sometimes from lack of luck instead of ability .
It is n't only in the cricket where the choice is difficult , where verdicts which are always subjective at the end are necessary .
Is it the right time for Bopara to climb ?
Is if he does it it fair to Shah ?
Executives the same can be asked perhaps also in another one area whether for example John Edwards or `` Tubby '' Banerjee , both intelligent has young with good degrees which know the business well , should be transported .
Who can say what is the right class for a cricket player unless the possibility is given to him swimming or going down ?
Numbers have of course a great influence on decisions but chances also have this .
Within a team a cricket player must catch the eye of the captain in the right time if he can take a Wicket and a thug must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make impression as a one-day cricket player .
It is more complicated to catch the eyes of the end voters .
There was much this one will play in the last season better in the first test apparently when , for example when James Anderson were even if Stephen Harmison pronounces himself healthy and as the wind plays ninepins into the nets .
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 rushes each to earn a position in this tour .
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average but both had their highlights and hope for still more .
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiriya stage can be only a view question .
The choice could decide the careers of both men or it perhaps really makes little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka and this one played Gareth Batty in every test and was successfully rushes in the first , with five Wickets and useful to 40 , it was , however , Paul Collingwood to consolidate , which passed the breakthrough to an important test cricket player although it perhaps still is , a double one one hundred against Australia in Australia punk head of a column underestimated , at that time , still fighting for himself .
Probable is that youthful enthusiasm will their conservative instincts and belly sense of Shah 's greater experience follow , Vaughan and Moores , Graveney , after another discussion in the course of today 's net meeting in the Asgiriya stage about Boparas .
There are arguments for both .
His scintillating and valuable 88 test debut Innings in Bombay , 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara , which is seven years younger with 22 years and an excellent balance speak against switched on roll for Shah .
But Shah made May to only ten rushes into his two Innings in this against the west Indies in the test into Lord , his native country arena as a player from Middlesex , and this , plus his immediate rejection , from the end voters as Vaughan was well the swing take back around for the next , his position seems from his beat taken , still in Bombay obvious have this one game was .
Unlike this the all-rounder has in shovelfuls zest for life from Essex .
Recently one vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition it is impressed by nothing on a cricket place and its attitude away from this was taken to the point , as it England 's sponsor Volkswagen had estimated .
It suffered from smaller injuries and presumably a shock but it was the first which it did to get its Vodafone ( of course also gesponsort ) out and to call Alastair Cook which had watched this from the distance and to say with enthusiasm for its team colleagues : `` Have you seen this ? `` .
Bopara is a much better player on the field , it its middle speed plays ninepins with some effect here on the fields which seems to match it and beats with confidence and dexterity .
A different one is to choose a thing , the right time to vote for the right man .
Perhaps this is the real art of the choice .
I tend to give Bopara its chance now , what does n't mean that perhaps dastehen is n't for Shah anyway well if it is the one as suggests the tea sentence from Ceylon who will play this weekend here .

He indirectly criticized SPD because of its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September .
Federal President Horst Köhler worries about the reputation of Germany and the large coalition has asked to end the quarrel about the reception of the Dalai llama .
`` We should n't present the outside world any split nation in this question '' , charcoal burner told Handelsblatt .
Charcoal burner signaled appreciation of the reception of the Dalai llama by Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) in September at the same time .
`` The human rights are universally valid for me even if I have respect for the variability of the cultures '' , said charcoal burner .
Everybody knows the Federal President emphasized that Germany must keep sensitive balances in the foreign policy , Merkel , however , took into protection before the reproach , she pursues a new China policy .
`` The Federal Chancellor has n't taken distance of the traditional ein-China politics .
This also knows China `` , charcoal burner said .

Disinfectants in many places are saved up for
This year more than one thousand infections were registered in hospitals which could be explained by improper dealing with antibiotics .
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals , the overcrowding of the beds , the over-load of the staff , are n't good at all everything for checking the infections -- factors , these , so the leading woman doctor of the national epidemiology center .
In many places you economize also at the disinfectants .
A MRSA infection was diagnosed in the Traumatologie department of the János hospital recently .
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was admitted to the hospital after a serious accident .
The patient was isolated .
At the beginning of the year there already was a similar infection .
The injured of a serious car accident was the man had dismissed , little to return with a MRSA infection out of the hospital later , though . Since then , an important operation could n't be carried out yet because of the bacterium which still is in the body of the patient .
Until December 10th this year infections triggered out of hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant pathogenes were reported to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system , so the leading woman doctor of the national epidemiology center , Karolina Böröcz .
So so many infections triggered by multi-resistant pathogenes were registered certainly in the hospitals , however , the number of unrecorded cases might be higher .
About two thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) were triggered by the MRSA , the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to Methicillin-Oxacillin .
The Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) bacterium carry approximately a third of the people in its nose without it wanting to cause an illness .
SA conditional infections ( such as sore throat , tonsillitis , inflammations of the skin or wounds ) usually react to antibiotics well , they are curable well .
If the means are measured out too highly or used improperly , though , arises from the good respondierenden bacteria antibiotics resistant , which spreads fast under corresponding conditions in the hospitals .
Immune system which is particularly with patients weakened or working badly durably , or these bacteria can patients with a low weight cause serious infections , such as wound infection or blood-poisoning , that is sepsis , but also into old .
According to the medical head of the János hospital the MRSA infection is nothing special , such occurrences are part of sick person house everyday life .
One must n't mistake the infection for the epidemic , manhte Tibor Nyulasi -- there is not MRSA only there where it is n't looked for .
Resistant to antibiotics
Such patients are `` , isolated this nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks at the supply and we dispose of the antibiotics necessary for the treatment `` -- so Tibor Nyulasi .
At their admission to the hospital the patients are examined for MRSA , an infection can not nevertheless always be avoided .
Samplings too rare
The majority of the infections in hospitals triggered by MRSA would be avoidable , the conditions ruling at present and circumstances are unfavorable for the checking of the origin or the spreading of the multi-resistant pathogene , though , Karolina Böröcz says .
After this infection happens predominant in hospitals and old people 's homes the Spitäler should examine the delivered patients and MRSA immediately infected isolate .
The microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced , however , in the Hungarian hospitals .
Not least because there are n't any subsidies for this examination on the part of the state health insurance company .
Most cases would come only then to the daylight , if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection , so the medical leader of the epidemiology center .
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the corresponding application of antibiotics in the humane medicine , there , however , are guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes also in Hungary .
Antibiotic therapies shall be purposefully , this means microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the means can form , this directive is n't always observed by hospitals either , though .
Microbiological samplings are even still more seldom the basic support of situated patient , so Karolina Böröcz , under the itinerant ones , or himself in .
You economize at the disinfectants
A scientific proof proves that MRSA from a patient is most frequently assigned to the other ones by the nursing staff .
The Händewaschen or wearing gloves and masks just therefore are of a great importance , there also are considerable defects in the hospitals in this field , though .
MRSA is transferred by droplet infection or contact , however , there is n't always the possibility in the local hospitals of isolating the infected patient .
The rooms are even often overcrowded although meter should a distance of at least 1.5 it give between them from the epidemiological view , the beds strung pressedly for each other .
Unfortunately , as Karolina Böröcz further says it even happens there are few male nurses , many patients , in the hospitals supplied financially less well that everything is economized at disinfectants -- factors which virtually favor the emergence of infections .
Such infections are provably far less frequent there or the further distribution of the pathogene can be held back where these protective measures are adhered to , so Karolina Böröcz .
Government program against MRSA
Health insurances cause this one enormous costs , to get a grip on MRSA infections they are therefore fought everywhere .
The prevention of MRSA or its checking was held tight in the government program in England for example .
According to first symptoms is the program successfully -- as published data verifies , is declining in England the trend of the MRSA infections .
The European center for illness prevention ( ECDC ) has the prevention of the origin of multi-resistant pathogenes also MRSA ( under this ) , as well as the prevention declared one of its priorities by infections in hospitals .

Fodor and the six Hungarian per cent
As minister of the environment Gábor Fodor announced , the expert meetings come to an end on Tuesday and the debate about the international climate regime after 2012 is continued by the secretaries after the official opening on Wednesday .
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the schedule of Bali in which the issue reducing measures are fixed after 2012 expiry therefore after expiry of the Kyoto protocol for the time .
At present , an intense debate is under way between industry and developing countries .
They already have the USA signaled that they do n't want to negotiate about concrete numbers , would be ready to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990 by 25-40 per cent to 2020 , though .
Whether the industrial nations are ready to support the developing countries besides the diminution of the issues both financially and technologically is the other great question of the meeting .
An agreement on the support of developing countries was also obtained .
This put the Kyoto protocol customization fund shall be managed by a 16-headed piece of advice most likely at the global Umweltfazilität ( GEF ) of UNO as has to be looked up `` in the Piac és profit '' .
Hungary six per cent
Minister of the environment Gábor Fodor supports the endeavor in the name of Hungary keep the EU , its pioneering role at global climate protection measures and obtain a new international agreement to 2009 .
The secretary declared the EU will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % to 2020 ( measured against the values of 1990 ) independently of whether the `` agreement after 2012 '' is obtained successfully or not . The union would be even ready to support a 30 per cent diminution other great industrial nations of the world or developing countries are also ready to meet their liabilities after strengths and responsible , soferne .
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the target of the states which had joined the Kyoto protocol in 1997 , a diminution from merely 5.2 per cent , was whereas , at that time , the EU had already itself committed 15 member states to doing a minus of 8 % with hers .
Diminution of the greenhouse gas emissions by 6 % in comparison with the years 1985-87 , a specification which will absolutely fulfill the country as the specification has to be looked up in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment , is for Hungary .
Use is high in Bali -- after all , the long-dated international climate political agreement must be ready within two years , it would otherwise become effective certainly first after 2012 . In this case no renewed , international emission reduction system would follow the diminution plans fixed in the Kyoto protocol , the meaning also has stressed the IPCC , the scientific climate change committee which is international and awarded the Nobel peace prize for UNO in its latest report .
Through what would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences the consequence according to the Wissen 's anuses the emission reduction would be delayed and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2° degrees Celsius would be inevitable .

It one wants or how will everyone fix uninterestingly for other
Stop and go traffic , the car in the middle of the regular morning jam .
A strange melody resounds from the radio : The sound of a violin mated with electronic stock exchange securities .
I turn the volume more highly .
The speed changes , a female choir the bass comes to the previous sounds and as a real sound jewel .
It is the song `` Wings of Love '' of Zagar which resounds on mr2 .
The local music scene has n't spoiled us with qualitative Electropop long time at all .
One sees even the jam but now differently if one hears the new album of Zagar .
The garage skirt with its Gitarrengequitsche contributes a new and exciting production from the local digital Underground scene slowly the seem , and even if again `` into '' is , which proves local Electropop of Yonderboi , so some to a change of the overall picture : There is something new under the sun .
Balázs Zságer it has begun in Pécs , played instruments even in the band Yonderboi before perhaps because a pub does n't stand two pipers -- started with its own way to follow .
He made the breakthrough with its project ( Zagar ) and its music which merges elements from jazz , electronic and pop but had approached only as one with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film to him ( e.g .
`` Szezon '' of Ferenc Török ) .
The formation which at first had appeared in smaller clubs became under only known to the wider audience , as the magazine `` wan2 '' the its first album from the year 2002 top strung 50 local albs and Zagar chose a marketable trendsetter together with Yonderboi to the almost only one also in the west .
Zagar and his band undoubtedly were `` trendy '' , however , no-one was interested in knowing whether they also like to bear this brand .
The band has reacted as it should : With a new , even better album .
The new album with the title having been published now tumble Fly Instead `` Can not `` could open up ways new to them , the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years , though .
The expression originates namely from the time when Balázs Zságer was still away with another band .
The airy , flying allusion would be also all right louder guitar , the influences , these fall besides the ethereal character of the music , though the rock 'n ' roll open , corresponding to the Zeitgeist and the trends .
With these songs the singer living in England and working with the band `` The jigsaw puzzle '' , György Ligeti , has introduced himself to the premiere in the Millenáris .
A song of the album has created it even for the radio pop song -- since latest of early till late pop music sending to it mr2 Petofi has gradually set the listeners the earwig with the number `` Wings of Love '' which was taken by six local singers ( `` Underground stars '' ) under cooperation .
Everything OK so ?
The hvg.hu has enquired at Balázs Zságer .
hvg.hu : This new hit raises the question : How far is your music reserved for a certain layer ?
Balázs Zságer : The concept `` layer music '' does n't mean much to me at all .
In my opinion gives two castes in the pop music and to be more precise not Mainstream and Underground or alternative and pop but commercial and honest .
Alone the so-called alternative or Underground music can be shallow and meaningless , be able to do her but be produced also only for the sale which makes her to commercial music just the same .
A good pop number also can arise from an honest motive .
The receptiveness of the listener works independently of languages and national boundaries also according to this principle .
hvg.hu : Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign audience opposite your music ?
B. Zs . The pop music has particularly a greater tradition west of us abroad .
Only teenagers or persons in the twenties do n't go to concerts but also the older audience there .
You follow up the trends in the pop music much more attentively which happen around it because they also regard it as a part of the contemporary culture .
hvg.hu : Which role befits the audience at your work ?
Is it , important whom , where , how many listen to your music ?
B. Zs . Of course it is a good feeling to see that more always come to our concerts .
However , we have never composed for the market .
With us the music does n't arise to serve a purpose but for a certain reason .
The role of the audience is noticeable at the concerts mostly where there already is a mutual interaction but in turn there is this one only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment .
I have nevertheless noticed one : If you want to make it to everyone right , you are no longer interesting .
hvg.hu : How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi ?
It is away as a soloist and its career rather has built up in the west .
B. Zs . We do n't really go its way that one again and again tempted , this in our music hineinzuinterpretieren , completely except for it .
We see each other sooner than team player , which on the musical presence of the different one let trust and it develop .
At first comparisons of our work with it of Yonderboi were unavoidable of course since several get from us from its band and have taken another way .
hvg.hu : In the charts of mr2 Petofi suits `` Wings of Love '' in first place .
Many have belonged to the names Zagar only in connection with this number .
Was the opening staged with an a little more popular style in the direction of conscious of a wider audience ?
B. Zs . We did n't have any plans to write a hit which then shall suffer for the album as a carthorse .
In this song it is all about more .
It was thought as a final of the album with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult topics .
hvg.hu : How have you selected the six singers ?
What was the conducting principle why exactly her ?
B. Zs . It was the basic idea to make a gospel song like choir .
The idea of arranging the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene then came .
So Edina Kutzora is Judie Jay , Bori Péterfy , Eniko Hodosi [ Neo ] , Juci Németh the choir of six come into being , therefore Sena , , which then we have christened apäter `` Underground stars '' .
hvg.hu : Did you want to have the song just the same or has it co-formed the girls ?
B. Zs . There already was the number in the instrumental version longer but when the material was ready for the album , we imagined that this number still `` needs something . ''
The Akkordenabfolge has really asked for a song voice .
I still have one sung the melody in the same night , she has learned the girls later .
Everything came practically onto straight off and alarming spontaneously .
I can remember , I was electrified quite at that time but it also has already required the `` stars '' .
The song would alone with my voice never have got so firm .
hvg.hu : However , one had the impression both on the plate and at the concert the girls would be in the background .
There is n't any solo share ( except for the short solo of Judy Jay ) , they do n't have a role of their own , their song sings completely together and is n't louder than the music therefore is n't only accompanied by the music .
They stood behind also on the stage .
Is it intention ?
B.Zs . It was that way because of purely technical problems that they have stood behind .
We did n't want to send them solo roles consciously , though .
In the number it also is all about that these determined grand pianos , the grand pianos of the love emporheben , us that where who shall from forget his ego a little come , forgotten , and where is away , we simply allow one .
I would like that others also feel this euphoric condition which we have felt when the song has arisen .
hvg.hu : Which one was the most effortful song ?
B. Zs . Actually the musical Schaffensarbeit rather has none at all , it at given more difficult tasks when mixing .
Longer , where the groove did n't want `` rock 'n ' roll Goes To , The girls , `` to work for example at `` Dorian Gray 's dilemma '' in which I play on a concert piano or at , but after and after everything has joined himself together as in the case of a jigsaw puzzle .
hvg.hu : Which one is your favorite number of the new album ?
B. Zs . This changes with the concerts constantly and also now where I have the album `` losgelasssen '' .
At present , it is `` prophet Is A Fool '' escape From Never , `` The Earth `` and the number '' The seed `` .

Polívka came around its kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the quarrel about the brand of `` kingdom Walachei . ''
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava actor he has used the name `` Walachischer king '' as the first but the project had a team around Tomás Harabis in interaction with this in long-standing work built up .
Today , Polívka did n't take part in the negotiation .
According to his advocate the thing probably is n't completed with that , however , and his client will well lodge an appeal .
The quarrel goes therefore that Mr Harabis and his team want to participate in the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitically , said advocate after the negotiation Polívkas .
Everyone just introduced himself to the words `` Walachisches kingdom '' these actor and comedian .
Harabis also is of the same opinion .
`` We have an almost ten years ' work behind ourselves .
He said financial obtaining and concepts of the activities , `` .
According to him the cause is quarrel about money .
`` After years they have noticed that the project is successful and that they also could have something of this .
You want to win at our work parasitically , `` he passed on .
Lucrative business
According to the court Polívka used the name `` Walachischer king '' in one of its television programs for the first time .
The actor Radoslav Brzobohat ý crowned him in 1993 .
At that time , however , this was n't connected with the intention to justify a fictitious kingdom .
For some years , later , Harabis came onto the thought of distributing walachische passports .
From an originally droll action a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized , then attached the foundation of the company `` Walachisches kingdom '' to the Harabis .
In 1997 Polívka agreed to the use of its name and its signature in the passports and offered her owners even reductions at the visit of its farm and its performances .
Who will sit on the throne ?
The judge led today , too , that Harabis used only the bare idea which has made Polívka publicly in the shipment of `` ring '' for its entrepreneurial intentions .
`` The popularity Polívkas has helped the project for certain of the walachischen kingdom '' , said the judge .
However , she added that the soul of the project Harabis and its team which would have devoted themselves to it intensively are .
This one lasted for the cooperation for estranged parties up to the year 2000 today when Harabis organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín .
The disputes started to occur increasingly between Polívka and Harabis , `` saint `` King Boleslavs I. voted for until this with themselves never flax day since then , however , these in the withdrawal culminated .
The leading role then took up on suggestion Harabiss Jarmila Suláková as Königinmutter .
2002 then reached Polívka legal action , to Harabis and its company one which rejected the court today .
The competition prepared by Harabis could deprive clarity in the quarrel of the throne and half a princess .
A new king should result from it .
He did n't want to betray details and an appointment yet .
`` We want to rush nothing .
Something like that should be like the king move in the Walachei .
The king should be elected for a particular time .
Mr Polívka also can apply at it safely , `` Harabis added .

VTi test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 : Voruteile fade
To say the truth I was never a special fan the Peugeot 206 .
Many were n't worth his handling characteristics , one could describe the quality of the gearshift , the steering and also the processing as rather below average .
Now but his successor , the Peugeot 207 , is on the market and this one is better around much .
Opinion to revise thinks the station wagon with the name SW is still a piece further and I only have left .
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207 , I had to complain about the too low head liberty on the backseats for example .
These troubles exist the bodywork no more , then now the station wagon is so arranged that two meter men wo n't even suffer .
Fast further
I only go through the interior décor briefly to not repeat myself too much .
It is a quite excellent design where I have objections only because of the wretched middle tunnel .
I would welcome a little more designerische design there where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression .
The seats are comfortable and are the times past where perhaps we complained about too short seats or head-rests .
The side hold also has itself opposite this 206 fundamentally improves .
What the room supply concerns , one can feel the extended measurements of the bodywork also here .
The lack of head liberty already mentioned is also removed in the station wagon .
Suitcase into the trunk
However , the main thing at this car is the cargo hold .
I must describe this one as very good ( also because of the folding rear window ) loading in cash and space-savingly .
The cavities are equipped with safety harnesses which represent an ideal compromise .
You do n't disturb apart ache and hold also heavier objects tight be able to .
But we talk about the loading up volume .
Table is 428 liters loudly in the basic equipment , what is a rather average value in comparison with the competition .
Vehicle of this class , the Skoda Fabia Combi , most not sold in comparison with this in Czechia though .
The 207 compares SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav , we we establish if stays behind that the Peugeot around clear noticeable 52 liters .
For a foreign vacation or loading a baby carriage this value is already critical .
But to stress the Positiva I still must this one after folding the pillions down mention very flat cargo hold or also the very low loading up edge .
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with cubic capacity 1.6 liters and a performance of 88 kW .
And a 1600-Kubik engine which drives a family Hatchback should look so , said honestly .
He is quiet , has a low consumption and moves away well .
If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust were stopped up with a rag , then I only can be filled with enthusiasm by him .
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is n't traditional at all .
However , we must remember that we have tested a car equipped well with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine .
The basic price of the car with the 1400s gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still comes on .
With our engine it costs as of 410900 crowns what is already quite a lot .
The equipment quality of the test car beats with 80000 crowns in addition to beech once again .
We had head airbags , automatic air conditioner , automatic windshield wiper triggering , electrical window controls and and ... behind , though
So the car costs simple 531900 crowns , altogether .
One this is a crowd but you calculate once the additional equipment Fabia together and you want to arrive at a quite similar sum .
Therefore only remains the decision which brand one wants to choose .

Klaus : Debates of the ecologists are incredible
Global climate changes harm allegedly developing countries most .
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the difficulties of the global warming .
The criticism was referring to the international meeting of UNO coming to an end for the climate change in Bali now .
He executed , that in Vienna where he presented his book `` a blue , no green planet '' the debates of the ecologists are incredible .
Not only the structure of the meeting which of government delegates and such forms a strange mixture of not government organizations is unacceptable according to Klaus but difference between the rhetoric which accompanies it and the reality also the basic .
The debate there is unstructured , this it is a word firework `` only a substitute is , for an actual solution of present problems `` Klaus said .
The Czech president emphasized at the presentation of his book that the topic is very important for him and that therefore he commits himself to it so .
His satisfaction expressed also about this that his book is published in German translation because `` I often meet '' caricatures of my views him .
So interested parties could look up his attitude undistortedly now .
Klaus reminded that he no-one is climatic box but he has sufficient prerequisites in his opinion to write such a book .
He is finally a graduate to understand and to judge technical treatises capably , has experience with statistics and is also an economist .
He described the thesis as main statement of the book , that the climate permanently changes and that so its changes are normal that the effort is superfluously ineffectively and unacceptably influence the development of the climate , and that effortful no corresponding opinion admits for the global warming under the scientists that the results of the present changes are great and serious and therefore did n't represent no threat too .
Furthermore he regards to force unproved opinions upon others for unacceptable as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen he considers this a dangerous restriction of the liberty .
On questions of persons present he explained repeated , he is not up against `` , but against militant environmental activists , a sensible environmental protection which does n't consider the relationship between effort and yield `` .
Klaus had already talked about the same topic in Vienna in the Hayek institute two months ago .

Political Capital : A Hungarian guard increases state risk
In opinion of the department of risk analysis ( Risk Analysing division ) of Political Capital the activities of the Hungarian guard founded in this August with support `` of the movement for a better Hungary '' have the risk of Hungary and raised the region in more regard .
Among other things it is called in the `` Risikowarnungs report '' of the institute : In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk puts this one increase the ethnic tensions between the gypsy and not gypsy population already existing in Hungary `` , which could lead to violent ethnic discussions even at short notice `` .
Main reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which presumably aims at the provocation of such a discussion , so the research institute .
As reported this as an omission is on the part of this one seen in persons responsible politically : `` Persons of the public life have left the discussion of the Romany question to representatives of radical political groupings , on the Romany Hungary contrast these have built up their political strategy now '' .
One suspects that this would intensify the problem , make the sensible dialog impossible , favor extremities as well as increase the probability of violent discussions .
The Forschungsinsitut means ausserdem not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the local and foreign media which would have activities of the Hungarian guard , `` the picture of Hungary damaged abroad considerably , what particularly concerns the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity `` .
We remember : Since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups has been continuous in Hungary in the upswing so that calling organizations were founded several , himself `` national self-defense organization '' since summer 2007 .
They have these groupings in common `` , that himself their members respectively define as a civilian organization open while they are boasting openly -- armed from time to time -- defense tasks under reference to the unfitness of the police of preparing ( disaster controling , national defense , Ordnungshütung ) , the army or the state itself , `` , they was said .
And : All this happens in accordance with that method which tries to disguise endeavors as a civil initiative which are been different and being based on the politics and party unwillingness of the population , political .
So the emphasis of the civilian character and the organization form do n't merely serve the avoidance of legal hurdles which could appear in the course of the entry for court , it is a political strategy at the same time .
As has to be taken from the analysis , the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk increasing factor also for the relations with the neighboring states .
`` Within the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger , many an extremist nationalistic politician of certain neighboring countries sees the confirmation of his own anti Hungary policy so in the emergence of the Hungarian guard .
All this has effects on the political stability of the region `` -- it was said .
From the view of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian guard is n't an individual phenomenon in central east Europe , the political risk therefore has grown for the complete region .
As reported , the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable with those of the Bulgarian National Guard whose foundation you announced in August 2007 of the radically right-wing Bulgarian national union ( BNU ) .
The Romany mass riots which have taken place in a district of Sofia ( Krasna Poljana ) were in the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard .
At once , the BNU has taken the occurrences for the foundation of the National Guard as an opportunity with the argument that the aim of the organization is the `` national protection '' .
In your opinion a real `` gypsy terror '' was namely noticeable in Bulgaria within the last 17 years , Political Capital remained the state , however , idly and indifferent -- so .
And : The initiative would have lot kicked an intense debate in the Bulgarian public .
As said the increased risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Romany organizations have announced to found their own guard for resistance purposes .
The Hungarian Romany shows the Bulgarian National Guard the Hungarian guard 's till now many similarities to these , the activities does n't have to be excluded since that also , reacts with organizing their own protection to the threats , is called in the risk warning report of Political Capital it .
Attila Juhász , research director at Political Capital said on enquiry from the message office : The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute .
Risk analysis reports would be published , and should it be recognizable for risk changing trends , is informed the public opinion every year like in the case by the publication of the risk warning report .

30 second videos , the Internet users this one have roll-ups sent in via Youtube , are hardly more than keyword giver .
John McCain reproaches his opponent Ron Paul who demands an immediate discount as the only one in the round from Iraq `` we have let Hitler come to the power '' with this kind of isolationism .
Also Romney gets strongly the read of the Vietnam veteran , as it an interrogation method refuses , the so-called `` Waterboarding '' , drown which you feign but to condemn torture .
The reactions of the hall audience show Petersburg in piece in Floridas that the important topics of the campaign lie , however , on the other side of Iraq war and torture debates meanwhile .
When conservative values are always praised and future tax increases declined approval surges in the lecture-hall .
More lets himself be seen once where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie .
`` I have been mistaken at that time '' , it Romney explains remorsefully and makes in front of base and viewers its apology for this that was still proper in 1994 to the abortion supporters .
Giuliani , however , starts lurching from side to side , you ask for its opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible as it .

For the institute which operates under the brand name Popular Max these branch offices mean a big milestone .
Popular as the first bank group represents the jump but also for the remaining Spanish institutes since the opening hours of its branch offices prolong H to 20.30 on weekdays and H to 20.30 set H of 10 on Saturdays dares .

The negotiations of the bank going on at present with the labor unions seeming to aim at an agreement , which be closed 75 % of all branch offices on Saturdays and open for this on a weekday in the afternoon if also not for the customers .
Whether further banks of the new initiative which adapts to the business opening hours follow will depend on the empirical values of the Popular Bank .
And this is just the intention which pursues Popular with its project , too .
It is aim to extend the opening hours of those branch offices which can include the customers of independent , small and perigynous enterprises inclined to buy but also these of large department stores due to their situation .
The bank would like to open the new 200 branch offices in the course of the next 18 months since it is n't new but changed opening hours .
The bank will alter the premises of those branch offices which already are in business zones and bring them into line with the individual customer image of the different zones simultaneously for this .
So the expansion of the opening hours gets connected to a new interior design of the branch offices which stands out due to a more current , more colorful design .
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does n't require any larger investments but it would be accompanied by an increased staff attitude since a branch office needed no more six but eight or nine employees now .
The branch offices which even will be equipped with additional premises for the SMEs wo n't sell any financial products .
A positive experience for the group
Its concept has already tested Popular to nine branch offices in Madrid .
And the empirical values turned out positive , so Ángel Rivero .
Vía have been selected for this , the branch offices of the streets bravo Murillo , and O'Donell what seems to have been a clever decision the grain .
Popular is conducting approx . 2500 branch offices at the moment .
And further 60 operate on which under the name Mundocredit . These are specialized in immigrants and also show extended opening hours even on Sundays and bank holidays .
The model of the BBVA is n't used in these branch offices of PopularMax since most of them will offer a broad choice of not financial services for the sale instead .
We would n't like Rivero declares to represent competition for our customers ? ? .
With Telefonica they have come to the agreement , to sell mobile telephones with the help of external bank staff for the time being .

Was busily the terminal with refugees from Syria and Jordan which had returned in private transports at the bus station Mansour , still before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen busses .
`` I decided to go after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad to Syria '' , said Sabah Al Qubaisi , a Sunni doctor .
`` Today , I came back because of this which I have seen on television and which I have read in the newspaper , would be sure over now what has happened in Baghdad and like it . ''
You say that the Mahdi army has killing people stopped `` this one has ordered with respect to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al Sadr , he said , to put back his strengths for the present time .
Qassim Al Atwani swept his two children a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominant one back , because he could n't replace his Syrian visa Sunni part of Amariyah and because the regime not permissible Iraqi work .
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a militia which is local and supported by the USA has to expel Al-Qaeda from their bastion in the west of the capital contributed he and insisted for the return .
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe which had been expelled from his house by an attack in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad with hand grenades after it had asked its fellow citizens for the fighting Al-Qaeda .
He was come back to fight .
`` Two days ago some of my friends called me they and one said to me , that in Sleikh started with the anti Al-Qaeda militia and that they need my support and those of my boys .
This is why I have returned today `` , Sabaah aluminium said to Obeidi , 62 .

`` I can not this one my house trust a government which supports the criminals burned down , after I went away . ''

It became she today that it has given a teddy bear a name for a court in Khartum for this demonstrated .
According to detail of her advocate became the British teacher who had been accused of insult of the Islam in Sudan , sentences evening of a court to 15 days imprisonment and following expulsion in Khartum on Thursday .
The brit was accused to have permitted six to seven-year-old pupils to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden .
She would have deserved to be whipped .
After parents of pupils had complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education and the Arts repeatedly , the 54-year-old elementary school teacher who was active at the Unity High School of Khartum was picked up at home at herself on Sunday and accused of the Islam after article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of the insult .
This matter actually takes its beginning in September when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy bear .
The children suggest eight names Abdullah and Mohammed , under this Hassan ? ? , principal Robert reports bowlses .
Finally when the class takes a vote , 20 of 23 children vote for Mohammed as the kindest first name .
The name of the Islamic prophet but primarily also one in Sudan is surely very more frequently Mohammed first name .
Is then my name Mohammed have the children prepared a book for the class , with the photo of the bear on this and the caption ? ?
The bear itself did n't carry any signpost with this name but the problem is very simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult of the Islam .
Innocent fault would never have I am sorry only for a name that it has asked the children this only is one its opinion something done one of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons who teaches in Sudan , explained at the same school it knows it well and it had with what it could get a religious faith too near ? to vote ? , ? ?
An opinion which numerous pupils of the teacher share the this as ? very attentive opposite their pupils ? ? and as person who never talks about religion in the class ? describing .
One considers that the first name Mohammed is also the second name given the second most frequent on in Great Britain for which 14 different notations exist in English .
This first name often selected by Muslim families is ( given a family ) regarded as a kind of respect to the prophet he frequently gets the firstborn .
But what are the rules quoted in the reference to the use of this first name ?
May one give him to for example a toy ?
This is of course a question of the interpretation .

Bulgaria , the property paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian property market is splendid -- all of Europe looks awarely of the Balkan State seldom mentioned earlier .
What does and who buys on the still cheapest market the EU which rapidly , however , gets more expensive , where ?
An analysis of the Bulgarian redouble/Max Division .
At present , Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular plaster in the East European room for purchases of property with favorable ski suites and houses by the sea .
Between the mountains the winners the regions count Bansko , Borovec , Pamprovo and Vitosa as one of the most popular ones , by the sea Albena , the `` Gold Coast '' , are , real estate is always asked around Kavarna and Balcik more , though , too , the `` sun coast '' and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar .
Russian draws more buyers wrong in the opinions of redouble/Max Analysten in Bulgaria wid the inland region sooner or later attract investors , so for example Veliko Tarnovo , Gabrovo , Elena and Triavna and also the really favorable area , of , too .
The capital Sofia also offers enticing offers -- trade and office space offer highest returns .
It is Bulgaria to become way of one of the most attractive European golfer paradises and therefore to attract tourists besides the summer and winter also in the two other seasons on the best one .
Foresighted investors therefore buy already now in the great style one , for example about Bansko .
According to analysts people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria also strive for a change of their way of life .
Most buyers are Englishmen , however , interested parties from France , Belgium , Spain and always more from Romania also come .
Investors from Malta and Cyprus it is presently , lasting also sea with the black and in the skiing areas mainly Russian buyers gives .
There are three groups of foreign buyers , Georgij Jankov , regional director of redouble/Max Bulgaria , says .
Those which want to sit down buy revitalisierte real estate by either 50-100,000 euros or shabby houses by 5-15,000 euros which then renovate it themselves .
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are written with a capital letter but are also the proximity to a city , business and doctors decisively for the buyers .
Those , these are part on the search for a vacation domicile are ( of the second category Bulgaria was in December under the top Ten vacation aims of the Germans listed ) .
Business people who invest with the aim of a middle to long-term increase in value agree on the third group .

EUR . The money shall flow in education , traffic and environmental protection infrastructure and energy industry .
In the year 2006 , the European investment bank ( EIB ) has allowed 300 m.

Card sharks
Does the credit crisis infect America 's credit card market ?
If blood is in the water , it is is only natural that dorsal fins irritated around whirls .
Now where America 's property market is ailing , the beasts of prey have the credit card market of the country in the visor .
Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect that the credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of infection of underfunded loans spreads on other forms of consumption loans .
Symptoms of the strain are considerably visible .
There are increases both at the end bookings and at the default rates which measure the share of the loans which respectively are n't retractable or more when 30 days too late .
The HSBC has because of the weak side of credit card recipients partly announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 billion dollars charges elevation from its American consumer financings .
It is nevertheless too early to sink into panic .
Losses and defaults are still low .
A full percentage point below the historical average was almost the third party quarter Säumnissrate of 3.89 % according to the Ratingagentur Moody .
The deterioration at the rates can partly be explained by technical factors .
A change in the American led private insolvency on the right laws to an abrupt case of bankruptcy registrations which in turn agree on a large portion of the Keditkartenverluste for one into 2005 ; registrations ( and with that default fines ) would this one rise again whether the number the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not .
The industry also reports of solid payment rates which show how much the consumers pay every month off of their debts
and the confidence in credit card based securities is rather strong despite the interruption in other corners of the structured financing .
Dennis Moroney of the control tower Group , a research enterprise , expects that the amounts of version for 2007 will be 25 % higher than last year in the end .
There surely are direct infection channels between the property credit crisis and the credit card market : it is more probable that consumers raise credit card debts , now that own home loans dry out .
The card exhibitors look but therefore dropping house prices do n't redeem a bill of exchange necessarily in the credit rating of the borrower on the money river instead of on capital values .
You even can be for the card exhibitors of advantage .
The incentives for consumers furthermore to pay the mortgage rates diminish if the real estate is worth some as the value of the loan ; as a result the card debts get more important under the repayment priorities .
Card exhibitors also can much faster and more flexibly react as a lender to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits .
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a fast reassessment of the assets .
`` We wo n't wake up one day and the loans completely newly judge '' , says Gary Perlin , Capital Ones main finance speaker .
Even if a sudden cover shortage crisis is improbable in the credit card market , the risks of a lasting downturn are substantially more real .
If lower house prices and a credit reduction press America in the recession , the industry will stand undoubtedly before a more furious future .
They hold the far lookout for these shark fins .

These are n't Warhols boxes
Thinks to Ikea who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box but not to Andy Warhol .
Or anyway ?
At present , wooden boxes produced in Sweden are throwing dark shade on Warhols work list .
Fakes are a large part of the ninety-four Brillo boxings of the `` type Stockholm '' listed there .
After the Swedish newspaper `` expresses '' has stirred doubt about the genuineness of Andy Warhols Brillo boxings of the year 1968 up some months ago , internal investigations are arriving at a conclusion sobering up in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now : The six `` Brillo-Boxes '' which former museum director Pontus Hultén has bequeathed to the Moderna Museet 1995 as a gift , copies and well are also the large part of the another about one hundred Brillo boxings of the `` type Stockholm '' , these on the international art market into circulation are .
The past history is more artistically chaining confusing nested , one and kuratorischer productions .
Warhol created its first `` Brillo-Boxes '' , painted wooden boxes which are based on the red blue white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder `` Brillo '' , in New York in 1964 .
An exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museet 1968 exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard with Warhols consent : These were n't ( from reasons of cost ) of Warhol but were delivered directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik .
It was n't works of art but around the examples around bare exhibits .
At the same time , Warhol 1968 has given the permission well to let some few Brillo wooden boxes which were n't exhibited in the Moderna Museet , though produce in Sweden .
Contemporary witnesses are talking now about about fifteen boxes which have rightly gone down in art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol Brillo-Boxes with the name `` type Stockholm '' at that time .
More than 100 000 dollars have obtained some of them on auctions .
It is the problem now about one hundred wooden boxes which Warhol then has left to it have been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968 that legendary museum director Pontus Hultén has claimed wrongly later .
Hulténs 105 boxes were only 1990 actually produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg .
Warhol was already three years dead at this time .

Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate subjects the sceptics of the climate change like also those which put a social and political debate regarding this to the foreground to a merciless criticism both , the movement as whole must put a strong cohesion to the day .
This one , as in the case of the district president Zapatero whom fight against the climate change for more important keeps as the fighting the Islamic terrorism and even suggests , unites primarily if it is a leader of the movement ? new contract with the planet ? completing .
This suggestion takes him to explanation need , however , regarding the behavior or not behavior of his government which has decisively contributed that Spain is within the EU at the head of the countries which the specifications of the Kioto protocol at only few have fulfilled .
These who the persons responsible for the non-payment of the specifications are , this one this has to be led back and why his government has on which sectors ? contract with the planet ? had , not stopped this development suggested .
In addition , he is forced to now , this one intended to explain measures against the climate change without beating about the bush for the Spanish citizens by him .
Which companies will be affected by it , which individual and collective economy measures which behavior of the citizens shall be changed have to be carried out and which economic consequences arise from it .
More exactly said who must sacrifice himself and will pay for the rescue of the planet .
Has it and wo n't there be such explanations in future , though .
Just because it is itself about sacrificing and paying .
Because the measures which can be used really against the climate change are unpopular .
You are cost rich , uncomfortable and dangerous for the accounts of the companies and citizen .
Even the gasoline cent suggested by the PSOE seemed choice strategically seen to Zapatero to take the suggestion back so dangerously again that it felt forced .
It is correspondingly necessary to save the planets with nothing therefore with a pure propaganda and empty sayings real consequences without everybody now .
With impressive statements , commissions , committees , protocols and new offices .
This one must speak , neither still accuse nor demand politicians otherwise so suitable for election campaigns with his contracts with the planet instead but the demanding version follow , embroider the meetings and fill others with enthusiasm with his gentle courage and quality .
However , this can happen only if the contract does n't deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does n't pretend either that the bicycle gets future to the only means of locomotion or we may refresh each other only with a fan .

The Spanish independent radio Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and therefore overtakes its rival Antena 3 .
We have made it ? .
With this sentence the managing director of Telecinco , Paolo Vasile , made his satisfaction known at the stock market close . The transmitter escorted by him had his value around the double one his increases rivals Antena 3 .
An aspect , however , dampened his joy : This is exactly ? what me this is injured ; it did n't state a higher growth , that we , but that we had lower losses ? , .
It emphasized that she has n't sunk too deeply ? despite the weak market .
Telecinco ended the day with a positive balance of 2.54 % yesterday .
This profit decreases its previous this year 's losses on 15.66 % .
According to information from Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euros now in which Mediaset checks the main share of the capital ( 52 % ) and Vocento is involved only with 13 % .
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has to register a loss of altogether 40.5 % since January so that his market value amounts to the half with 2,193.46 million .
The market value of other listed communication enterprises , however , increases ; in the case of Sogecable on 3,571 million at Prisa ( publisher of the magazine Cinco Días ) on 2,518.53 million and at Vocento on 1,779 million .
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that himself ? it is two similar enterprises ? , so Vasile .
The question on which scale we can actually stock exchange technically proceed uncertainly still turns up for which price and how we can design it lucrative on customer level .
Telecinco explained its plan a week ago to climb to the first TV station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue this year . This assured the advertising enterprise of the group of Guiseppe Tringali , the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña .
If the plan should be realized , the transmitter would increase its advertising earnings in comparison with the 965.4 million by 3.6 % from the previous year .
In the case of Antena 3 the net sales increased ( up to 734.4 million ) by 1.6 % within the first nine stock exchange months while the net earnings could show only an increase in 0.7 % ( 630.4 million ) out of the watching TV business .
The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange course better in the comparison of Telecinco which the company could show until present time Payout reason at the high one : The enterprise escorted by Alejandro Echevarría arranged for a 100 per cent dividend payout in 2006 .
Vasile assures , however , that still could vary the reason after the purchase of 33 % of the shares of Endemol with Mediaset as a parent company even if it is still too early for an official announcement .
We are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50 % of the shares out even if we have shown off always considerably more till now ? .
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year whose share values we could already increase by the purchase of 33 % of the Endemol shares .
According to statement of the analysts the market is showing certain loss trends at present .
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced his profit calculation by 7 % at Telecinco for this year by 4 % and for 2009 .
This is the result of the cut in the expected rate of increase which will decline in 2008 from 10.5 % to 8.4 % and in 2009 from 5.5 % to 5.1 % .
This also has reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5 % and for 2009 by 7.5 % .
3 options .
1 .
Ibersecurities : the purchase of both shares puts dividend yield and its lasting potential on his high ones and therefore recommends .
2 .
Caja Madrid : measures Telecinco ( buy ) because of the ? multiple incentive ? at and the prospering market a more advantageous position as Antena 3 ( hold ) .
3 .
JPMorgan : similar threats recommend in view of the ? ? the expectations move back ( saturated market and worse economy climate ) in the two cases

British Bänker declare themselves guilty in the case Enron
Three British bankers who should be confronted for their role in the deceitful system with the former main finance leader of Enron , Andrew Fastow , with court changed their petitions into guilty on Wednesday .
Originally David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had pleaded open innocently in the year 2000 to make at the expense of its employer money for the alleged Konspirieren in seven cases of deceit below use of tele-means of communication with Fastow in a secret finance deceit .
The method had been set for January .
But during a hearing in front of court in front of U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein junior everybody pleaded for a case of deceit guiltily below use of tele-means of communication .
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest , a unity of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc , were confessed in Great Britain within delivery methods which lasted for two years .
Their case is a loose end of an examination which was started to Enrons collapse in 2001 in the United States .
The accusations submitted against it originally in the year 2002 drew Fastow attention to the fact that it was the aim of an examination of the government in connection with the Enron decline .
Conspiracy cooks up a former top adviser Michael Kopper the charges against the bankers around a deceitful one with Fastow and his -- been called the `` NatWest three '' , they are come in the year 2000 to Houston , claimed .
Greenwich Natwest had invested to a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron which was checked by Fastow which was the architect of innumerable deceitful Enron wheelings and dealings which have contributed to tear the company in the bankruptcy whirlpool .
The bank had the value at the beginning of 2002 its participation in the subsidiary on zero appreciated but the three British men knew that it had in reality considerable value .
An enterprise under Koppers control purchased the shares of the bank in the subsidiary for 1 million dollar .
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a participation in this enterprise .
According to the charges Fastow represented wrongly , that opposite Enron the energy enterprise would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary .
The 20 million dollars but actually went to the British bankers , Fastow and others .
Did 7.3 million dollars get the bankers during Fastow , Kopper , and cashed in other about 12.3 million dollars according to the charges .
Fastow declared itself for its role in two counts of an indictment on conspiracy in the Enrons flop guiltily in January 2004 .
The British trio was arrested three months later .
Fastow serves a 6-year prison sentence in federal prison of Louisiana .
Kopper serves a sentence of three years and a month in facilities in Texarkana .
Each of the three men was on free foot due to a 1 million dollar bail which required it that they lived in expectation of the legal proceedings in the United States .
Enron , once the siebtgrößte enterprise of the nation crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of book-keeping tricks could cover the billion debts up or make weak businesses seem profitable no more .
The collapse destroyed thousands from jobs , more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars Pensionspläne .
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former chairman of the executive board Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse .
Skilling serves a sentence of more than 24 years .
Lay 's condemnations for conspiracy , deceit and other counts of an indictment got trivial after it died because of heart disease last year .

`` Without this aim the sports political swing would n't be in the position to be maintained in the same measure . ''
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project but to find a new long-term approach for this `` which starts out from a changed time beam . ''

`` This preference means for us that in this no realistic chances will angedachten time period us have from us to 2028 till now . ''
The dream nevertheless was n't from dreamt for all time said of Beust .
The Hamburg sports federation ( HSB ) was sorry for the statements of Beusts .

`` It is too early to obstruct itself a chance by one burying the plans already at this time '' , said HSB president Günter Ploß on Wednesday .
Moreover , a renunciation of the application contradicts the statement of the senate boss on the occasion of a reception concerning the general meeting of the general German high school sport association .
There 2015 has described the application of Hamburg `` not as a substitute '' of Beust for the Universiade for Olympic Games in Hamburg .
The high school sport association had nominated Hamburg as an applicant town only last week .
The SPD citizens parliamentary group reproached the senate for having not used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg .
The little boy 's Grasbrooks has been delayed by the senate for years because it has put Olympia and left the house building aside on the card , `` the development `` the SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast said .
While SPD for the little boy Grasbrook has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later living use has put CDU on the `` event factor '' one-sided .

The fathers of the cabbage skirt return
Germany 's super group of the seventies plays instruments again : The three ribbon members of Harmonia got to work on their consoles at a concert in Berlin once more .
For the revival one seems recorded from her great time `` live 1974 '' .
Even then they were fundamentally more famous abroad .
The arranged sensation then happens at the evening panel in the form of three of sedate sirs .
Everybody has his small box in front of himself , his cables and primarily his buttons .
Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the flower white shirt in the middle with 63 years .
Links flanked of Michael Rother 57 years young and in the possession of laptop computer and guitar .
Hans-Joachim Roedelius , 73 , bends himself concentratedly at the console , looked from the lecture-hall on the right .
From time to time , everybody even contributes noises beat , unite .
And sometimes it makes inadvertently a conventional piece of music .
This then does n't seem to disturb the sirs greatly either itself .
That the band Harmonia plays instruments again has under cabbage skirt enthusiasts for some excitement worried .
In which one may reveal here : However , specific demands showed so lastingly not at all that although the name buzzed by the collective pop memory to miss this band for 32 years painfully .
But why shall not the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies either ?
Particularly since what is misleadingly called cabbage skirt was always than in the country of one 's own more valid in England and America .
Group of Can 2003 awarded the echo prize for the life 's work to the survivors of the inhabitants of Cologne , one saw in the hall into questioning German pop faces as the music economy .
Himself talk Hot chilli pepper of Pepper as this one in the eulogy also with the bands La Düsseldorf and new ! the astonishment did n't know any limits thanked you .
At concerts Michael Rother squated at the talk Hot chilli pepper of Pepper on the stage like an old buddy later .
Transfiguration is the one the problem of the ignorance in the foreign parts at home and this one .
The memory is already therefore overtaxed with Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years and a far lower effect power than they were assigned to afterwards of other also developed at this time .
Moebius and Roedelius had played instruments already before under the promising name cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler .
At first one played in the cellar under the Berlin theater .
After this in Düsseldorf for economic reasons for a record label maintained of the church .
Rother had the at that time perhaps most radical German group , a reputation erspielt , helped out and following as a guitarist at new ! , at power station briefly .
Rother followed the cluster musicians at 1973 into the exile to forest in the Weser hilly scenery , though .
They lived as town brief communards there in the old Weser court , a ruin from the 16th century .
Less ideological than in the commune I , where Roedelius still was allowed to be troubled as a nanny .
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist existence .
Allegedly a pennant of the singing club also found itself Harmonia Ottenstein in the bulky refuse and for the art a name .
Some held Harmonia of this tight .
The first album was called `` music of Harmonia '' and the following `` de luxe '' .
Because the music so calmly and modestly also sounded , the band suffered a material need .
The Reisigsammeln did n't serve alone the self finding .
In front of an only just 50-headed record scenery , the CD `` live 1974 '' appeared now was recorded for somebody thinks at a concert in Griessem like itself to remember .
The desire to push Harmonia and to practice occasionally came from Rother at that time .
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand .
The band explained its separation in 1975 .
Rother landed in the esoteric spherical one and secured its existence for itself with albs like `` fiery hearts '' .
Cluster was revived in the eighties and is more successful than it was ever Harmonia since then .
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer .
It has aimed at the record firm Greenland , the cabbage skirt as a very own German contribution to cultivate music to the live one .
New ! did you already dig up like Roedelius solo plant ?
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world .
Subsidized publicly in the context of the festival Woldtronics .
Julian Cope is there , the brit , old punk and author of the manual `` cabbage skirt sampler '' .
The Loveparade inventor is also Dr. Motte there .
With what the complete frequency range of the influences of the cabbage skirt on the following pop music would be outlined .
The blank of the super group is filled out by Harmonia .
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar Sounds in the hall : `` Music only keeps , these the future belongs to her . ''
There are pictures which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse parlor .
Projections of additional black-and-white photos of confusedly cabled equipment serve the putting formation .
In front of that the three veterans are occupied with the improvisation again .
Not eliciting outrageous tones from instruments around which over effect equipment built any more by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums .
The electronic music looks like electronic music today .
Tinkerer deepened three into the technical one .
To this the choir of the house also changes nothing .
The line Barbara Morgensterns is coughed and whispered under Soundwolken and sung in a beautiful place with emphasis under .
Cabbage skirt was always a very English concept .
It never was skirt .
The roots were looked for less than in colleges of music ( Can ) , technologies ( power station ) or on the flight with artistic and social conventions ( clusters ) in the blues .
Who here 68 calls , not quite is wrong and Harmonia can not be brought by it now either from the quiet .
The most natural is reconsidered thoroughly on the stage .
Where does music begin and when does she stop ?
This can rob one of the nerves or grant brief moments of great happiness .

The choice of the status Quo
On Sunday it wo n't get thrilling at the counting of the urns : The mass of the Russians will decide party , united Russia , in favor of president Putins .
After an election campaign bolted very much she confirms her striving for stability , yes even for authoritarianism .
For three days with the parliamentary elections the Russian president directs Vladimir Putin a news radiated on the public transmitters to the voters which was already recorded , whose contents are kept secret , however .
He does this in his quality as a favorite candidate of the united Russia , the pro-Kremlin party for which an overwhelming victory is heralded .
Has the president let nothing be getting it yesterday when he greeted the foreign ambassadors and was content to provide a new target against the western powers which is accused of the interference be favorite subject during the election campaign .
We know the price of a truthful democracy and hope for honest elections extremely transparent and open , elections , without cheatings ? ? , it added .
They have slipped up from the view of the opposition there .
By oppression prangert stained one you election campaign .
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov does n't say it would have , ? given never such dirty elections , once at the time of Eltsin ?
Is valid after the oppression of the demonstrations at the last weekend sentenced to five days custody for former chess world 's champion Garry Kasparovder for demonstrating forbiddenly had been according to his advocate furthermore visit ban .
Have the Russians kept the mentality of the homo Sovieticus ? ?
After these parliamentary elections without tension two questions leading on much raise themselves :
? Who will succeed Putins as a president ?
The office newspaper has the date of the first ballot of the presidential elections announced , March 2nd , 2008 , yesterday ; the candidates have time until December 23rd to announce himself .
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004 , Vladimir Putin can not begin for a third mandate in consequence .
And no successor is found now .
Which role will Putin play after March ?
Prime minister ?
Chairman of the parliament majority and will select party united Russia , the government and president the all-powerful ?
Whatever will the parliament be it , at or at the presidential elections the previous becomes power triumph ?
This is tradition .
The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo Sovieticus ? , they are n't master of their destiny ? , the sociologist Lev Goudkov , director of the independent center Levada , thinks .
Saint Petersburg even still goes on the historians ' Nikolai Kopossov back from the state university : The civil society has itself in this country , this became to Europe christianisiert for five centuries , developed further only very slowly ; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality .
After the liberal reforms of the nineties Putin has Maria Lipman of the Carnegie foundation thinks tied to the model of a paternalistischen state all the more again which was accepted by the population completely more economically since prosperity no terror followed on this new paternalism but a more certain .
Do without today ? ? the Russians ? from liberal pieces on the personal responsibility ? , have they put which after the disintegration of the USSR for a short time to the day .
Still think over for what ? for a long time ? ?
This phenomenon concerns all social strata including the business community .
And the administration elite knows how to keep the status Quo : 65 governors ( of 85 Russian region chairmen ) cite the local choice lists of united Russia .
The liberties which are new and coming from the west are often equivalent to chaos , as in the nineties .
The general public prefers stability .
In this meaning the Russians wo n't vote for the extremist parties either .
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko , a 54-year-old lady professor : Still think it over for what ? for a long time ?
Those which are at the power are n't so bad , why take them off ? ?

Auchan at the most expensive one , Tesco increased around almost a fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trade area also have this year keeps the average price increase of 16 % of the last year with the difference that no rise of the value added tax gave it this year .
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trade triangle the price of the usual Christmas basket of the `` Napi '' of also this year by 16 per cent has increased , price increases were registered by over 1,000 hooves into all Hypermärkten , though .
After the prices have `` galloped from it '' in the food markets in last December , the price increase prozentuell has n't turned out drastic , compared with the anyway high , earlier baseline .
It seems certainly deterrent to the consumers , though , that hoof is n't even this year for what they had paid hoof last year still far under 9,000 available for 10,000 .
The price of the `` Napi '' shopping basket exceeded the magical 10,000 hoof limit hoof in the examined markets by at least 91 .
The highest price amounted hoof to 10,573 .
The price at 6,800 was ( hoof ) in 6800 .
The prices remained almost on last year 's level for Unicum and live fish , the prices for turkey breast pieces of tenderloin , nut and poppy , have increased strongly , however .
Prices for flour and bread corresponded , the head offices of statistical office of Hungary to the data there was 1 kg of bread morning call for 139 Forint at Auchan , however .
There was n't any competition conditional sudden fall in price at the product on under 200 Forint .
The price of a two liters Coca-Cola returnable bottle of under 200 Forint was here , also surprising the drink therefore cost inclusive pledge only 257 hoof .
This year in the `` Napi '' shopping basket comparison Auchan at the most expensive one and Cora at the most favorable one nevertheless came off .
Our calculations have arisen that have Cora , increased by 18 per cent during Tesco and Auchan respectively the prices in the `` Napi '' shopping basket opposite the Christmas prices last year at 15 .
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the this year 's year was 12 % the rise between the cheapest shopping basket of the last year , lasting and expensive the current year 21 % turned off .
The average rise in prices was 1,480.00 hoof .
The average price increase was at 1,206.00 Forint in the previous year still , the added value tax increase manifested itself at the prices at last Christmas , though .
Exactly this process has affected the trade terribly : The department stores apparently could n't decide so properly which price margin they shall use at the individual articles since the effects of the price increase on the consumerism were unforeseeable .
( If the dealer plans the circulation speed of a product badly , he can fall around essential profits in the price margin which goes by the traffic intensity . )
The price increase of the `` Napi '' shopping basket turned out Mehwertsteuer conditional so radically last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint whereas the price difference was merely 844 Forint at the cheapest basket .
Such extremes were n't watched since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 Forint more than in the previous year and this year there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00 Forint even at the cheapest one .
Showed itself a disastrous price increase in the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons , the price of the daily consumption articles into the Hypermärkten has increased into less than 20 months around more as 30 per cent .
( In turn this does n't confirm this one the head offices of statistical office of Hungary absolutely to data : The statistical office stated one more than a 30 per cent price increase at some basic foodstuffs in the period of 12 months .
Next to flour also at eggs so approximately ) .
If one takes , however , a look into the `` Napi '' shopping basket , this almost seems at the latter by no means , there the price level the has risen even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent already in the previous year of expensive product .
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten -- after all , they could pass the drastic price increase on to the multinationals .
The Hypermärkte do n't complain in the golden trade triangle ; It is reported constantly of good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers does n't look on the prices in the three department stores any more .
Large quantities are bought from everything , durable food goes in pallets over the shop counters .
There were endless snakes in all three department stores at the Kassa Wednesday morning when the number of the customers suddenly exploded .
Is of , though , a lower customer frequency reports to the country so that many multinationals complain to the pollsters they could n't reach once the planned sales volume and to be more precise not only at food but also at lasting consumer goods .

The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will the Championsleague-first part of the season fight for the point which they lack around her respective aims still reach in San Siro next Tuesday in front of degree . The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while this is deciding on their participation with the Scots .
The Italian team has already five points and hers have already confirmed participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal while the Celtic Glasgow still needs a further one with nine points to go for certain that the FC Shakhtar does n't catch up with the Befica Lisbon with six points with four points .

A defeat could be enough for the team of Gordon Strachan even at a setback of the FC Shakhtar to qualify .

Small Saarland , good education
The smallest federal state is leading at the vocational training and shines even with the international orientation of its universities .
Only in an education field the same pushes the inhabitants of Saar deficit like the rest of the country .
`` I have explained for the 50th time to a not inhabitant of Saar yesterday that we are n't Frenchmen '' -- the smallest federal state placards this slogan self ironically for its 50th birthday .
In this France and Luxembourg play a large role in the educational system of the Saarland which lies on place five in the education monitor of the institute of the German economy Cologne ( IW ) .
So the universities already cooperate narrowly with the neighboring countries from tradition .
The university in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 of the Frenchmen .
To this day can studying here with a double or even triple diploma complete her studies .
The share is correspondingly high foreign studying with 15.6 per cent .
But the Saarland also brings the natives of a country in number above average to the universities , much of them without a degree at the high school .
`` One uses the professional educational system in the Saarland '' , says Axel Plünnecke , education expert at the IW .
More than every fifth teenager purchases his studies right at a vocational school so that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average .
The combination possibilities of a professional and academic education are also comparatively expanded strongly .
Measured in terms of the total population the equipment is the second best one in Germany with dual courses of studies .
Despite the practical education and increasing demand the number of the engineer graduates has dropped by a third , however , within the last years .
The Saarland education department has committed the universities to doing a marketing campaign for engineer scientific subjects therefore now .
`` We have initiated quite a number of reforms after the first Pisa study '' at the schools with general educational value , says a spokeswoman of the education department .
So the government introduced nationwide comparison tests .
It is free of charge to learn to use to begin the children the last Kita year , a model which meanwhile also other federal states copy .
The performances of the pupils improve lastingly , will show themselves only future comparison studies whether .
The share of the Risikoschüler shrank from 29 to 20 per cent at Pisa 2003 .
Altogether , the Saarland , however , did n't increase as strongly as other federal states .
The Bavarians calculate better .
Points -- and to the frustration of the inhabitants of Saar Fremdsprachenkenntnise are n't measured at Pisa otherwise one could in this area .
Because the language of the neighbors is duty to high schools -- even if the inhabitants of Saar are n't Frenchmen .

Which insurance is suited for me best ?
The motor vehicle insurance which covers a possible claim caused by the driver contains a high expense of age , sex , time of the preparation of the driver 's license , marital status , type of the car to be insured and its use , among others whose height of re-rum of different factors takes off etc..
It is only the beginning to have a car .
Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance than the right vehicle model .
At first once must be clear for one with which we have to do it here .
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder .
This agreement is in writing held tight by means of an insurance contract which fixes that the society gets the arranged insurance premium and is engaged in return to present the corresponding compensation sum at a claim .
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance among others age , sex , time of the preparation of the driver 's license , marital status , type of the vehicle to be insured or its use which gets together by several factors .
The insurance enterprises fix their prices according to the statistics so that in case of a higher accident danger also larger payments of contribution get due .
Having to for this reason both about 25-year and make women less payments of contribution because statistics prove that these groups show a lower accident rate thanks to their caution .
The same also applies to married persons according to statement of the statistical values and therefore also after conviction the enterprise , too less accidents incline these , since as singles .
The use which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and thus also the probability of an accident .
The more frequent the use , the more probable the damage .
At the list of the bonus the insurances must take into account a whole number of points .
For this reason the driver also must study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance which most likely approaches his personal needs .
We list the most important points now in this place which one should draw at the choice of an insurance into respect to be not able to make only performance , but also a price oriented choice .
Meet the less than 25-year-old numerous obstacles , such as the low driving experience and this one ? young in the choice of a reasonably priced insurance ? Driver 's license .
Even if it would be the best for an ideal insurance cover to effect a fully comprehensive insurance , there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives .
The careful drivers can select a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess so that the services of a fully comprehensive insurance are covered but offered at a low price .
This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount arisen from the damage himself .
The amount is ? fixed before conclusion of the contract and using the amount of the insurance premium . This is more highly ? , the lower the sum to be paid Luis Noguera , main representative of Spain at roof ridge Europe , explains to an arrangement enterprise for online insurances .
Another option is n't , however , the extended insurance against the damages arisen at the car of one 's own which insures the customer against external accident damages .
In addition , this type of the insurance would cover theft , fire and vehicle loss .
Here one piece of advice .
If you are under 25 years old , it is in your hand to lower the insurance costs ; so your credit note increases by trying to drive carefully and to avoid accidents .
A credit note is a reduction in the base rate at the appropriate insurance company .
A punishing payment on the contrary contains an increase in a said rate to this .
Yields take off the height of credit notes and punishing payments ? of the society and this one .
If the enterprise has a yield rich year behind itself , can permit himself to increase the bonus payments ? , Noguera explains .
As soon as the 25 annual brand is exceeded , it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract . Reason for it is the fact that with an increasing driving experience the accident rate drops .
It therefore makes most sense to decide in favor of a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess .
The teenagers usually can not not profit from their previous experience , both in the case of an accident and at the time of the driving ? ? , this one explains abbots of the European enterprise Spanish and adds that the majority of the accidents happens in the second practice year after these ? fear of the beginner ? you put down .
It nevertheless is more advisable with a married customer who does n't have any children to effect a fully comprehensive insurance ; natural only then , if it also allows the financial situation of the corresponding person .
Married couple is regarded as the customers on the part of the insurers with children with the lowest accident rate and its payments of contribution correspondingly also turn out low .
In this case a fully comprehensive insurance would be the best option with percentage excess ( at an amount by the 300 euros ) . One a high credit note has received , an extended insurance recommends this one only to the third vehicle year to itself in the case that shows commitment .
Altogether , you drive ? eased and have a greater spending power which permits it to them to attach a larger payment of contribution ? , Luis Noguera states .
Offers one 's services for pensioners whom employs only at a sufficiently high credit note to effect a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess ( at an amount by the 150 euros ) or an extended insurance .
One must hold tight at long last that it is the car insurance a little very important that a thorough choice is made which corresponds to our personal situation not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages but also because it holds high costs which require it .

Allies in Afghanistan are passive , Americans claim .
To few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influences the course of the mission according to the United States in Afghanistan .
The NATO should draw up a concrete plan according to the words of Minister of Defense Robert Gates for the next years .
The mission in Afghanistan does n't get lost after their ideas , the representatives of the countries which have stationed units in the south of the country agreed in the Scottish Edinburgh .
The Taliban discuss the eight participating states besides the growing resistance on the part of also over further coordination plans under the allies .
While the United States were calling upon the NATO units for more activity by their Verteigungsminister Robert of Gate , Great Britain sees the priority in the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and in the intensification of the foreign aid .
`` A forward development is noticeable in Afghanistan but armed forces power can be only a part of the solution .
Larger part consists `` in making it possible for the inhabitants to start with even a development of the economy and safety the British Verteigungsminister of the Browne says to the BBC .
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest stand according to information from the American army for five years .
The number of force actions has increased by 27 per cent in the southern province Helmand even by sixty per cent in comparison with the previous year .
About 40000 soldiers stationed , of this approximately a quarter in the southern territory , have the NATO countries in Afghanistan .
According to the United States the allies , however , have reached an absolute border , what concerns organization and equipment of the units .
They concrete demand further helicopters , soldiers and experts for the training of the Afghan units .
We will have to think about the concrete aims seriously as we can accomplish them for the next time and about the way , said Gates .
The Secretary General of the NATO , Jaap de Hoop , similarly spoke today .
`` I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan to country and in the air at the disposal .
We have about ninety per cent of the soldier and equipment need which we would and this is too little , `` De Hoop said to the agency of Reuter at the completion of three-day conversations with the Japanese government in Tokyo .
Who is passive ?
Within the last months , quarrel over it also is , whether under the countries involved all allies give her best in Afghanistan .
Because of passiveness Germany was for example criticized .
`` The Germans are relatively represented numerously in Afghanistan .
However , you are stationed in areas , where there is only a minimum to force and the fight requirements are not so high for them like for us in the southern and eastern part of the country , `` Gates said .
The British tabloid `` Sun '' described the German soldiers as lazybones this week .
`` Afghan idlers exposed : The Germans make games while our Jungs are fighting `` the `` Sun '' wrote in a contribution which was completed by photos of German soldiers which play table tennis .
The German picture newspaper went over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unity at a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan .

Chávez switches the watches over
In Venezuela , the watches tick soon differently than in the rest of the world .
President Hugo Chávez has the timekeepers reversed in the South American country by half an hour on December 9th .
Chávez becomes in the meantime a joke figure in Spain .
As the Official Bulletin of Venezuela informed , the watches are adjusted to the universal time minus four and a half hours according to a new law .
The südamerikansiche state gets a time zone with that which there is not in any other country of the world .
Among other things the USA hostile Chávez justified his decision , that with that the United States of the world would have imposed the division into time zones at full hours .
Moreover , Chávez terminated Colombia the breaking off of the relations to the neighboring country announced because of a hostage affair on Wednesday ( local time ) .
The on the left nationalist said as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe president of Colombia stays would he maintain relationships neither to the leader nor to the Colombian government .
`` I can not do this already alone because of my dignity '' , said Chávez which advances a constitutional reform the citizens of the Öllandes must vote in a referendum on on Sunday .
With the reform he would improve his power considerably in the country .
Trigger of the quarrel was the decision Uribes to withdraw the mandate from Chávez in Colombia for negotiations with Marxist rebels during which it was about the release of hostages .
Uribe `` has spat Venezuela with his decision into the face '' , Chávez had criticized on Sunday .
Chávez is the talk of the town also in Spain .
A new mobile telephone bell tone provides furore in the country : You do n't think your mouth `` Por qué no te callas '' the sentence which people have already downloaded from the Internet more than half a million reads ( why ) .
Spain 's King Juan Carlos has it spoken , which was irritated by the permanent interruptions of the on the left populist at the latest Iberoamerika peak and this had driven over the mouth .

NHS `` must check foreign employees ''
The Scottish state public health service must improve controls of the criminal records for employees from outside of Europe , a member of the controlling organization said . outside
The recommendation of the main finance inspector Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought about to the airport in Scotland in Zusammmenhang with the stop of Glasgow in June .
Doubt also spoke Black , that the Scottish state public health service does n't have any exact ideas with regard to the number of its ausländischischen employees .
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly at a sample of five health authorities .
The main finance inspector examined staff which was recruited outside the countries of the European working area in result of the attack on the airport of Glasgow .
Bilal Abdullah , 28 , an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Krankenhaus in Paisley was arrested at the airport after a cross-country vehicle was driven by the doors of the main airport terminal .
He was one from three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in a video transmission in October and was charged in Great Britain in connection with the presumed car bomb attack .
It is expected the state public health service to carry out controls prior to the employment of foreign employees to ensure that these have the required qualifications , experiences and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom .
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland for the check of criminal records , the agency does n't dispose this information of the responsibility outside Great Britain too receivedly .
The report of the main inspector means besides other recommendations now that the executive board shall take up guidelines of the criminal records statement which helps employers at controls in different countries .
`` Although we have found references to these controls in some staff documents , these were n't carried out routinely . '' the report stated .
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their examination guidelines with high measure before the employment but added : `` Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that exact information about the number of foreign public health service employees is available . ''
BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it is `` extremely improbable '' that examinations would identify people prior to the employment of potential NHS employees who could make future terrorist attacks .
It is `` , that short-term pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is n't clear the recommendations will which added value provide `` , said in the report he said .
The Scottish health authorities say that they have 1,161 foreign employees at the moment the vast majority of it doctors and nurses .
The finance inspector , however , warned that it is more highly probably the number to identify those employees also therefore who are given leave until uncertain time because the executive boards would have problems .
Furthermore the examination stated that have established control methods been adhered to by NHS authorities predominantly in Ayrshire , Arran , Grampian , Greater Glasgow and Clyde , Lanarkshire , and Lothian .
Passport , green card , and qualification controls are included .
at present , the Scottish government is checking its policy and guidelines for controls for foreign staff in the NHS before the employment beginning .
The secretary for health Nicola Sturgeon said : `` It was a concern to me to execute this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport . ''
The Scottish government in connection with the health authorities which would take into account and ensure recommendations of the report completed you that the publication is -- under this also the ones from foreign countries -- that planned next month himself the best practices would be in updated guidelines regarding the control examinations prior to the employment of all employees re-mirrors .

600000 people did n't manage to exchange their driver 's license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver 's license whose validity goes off at the end of the year .
The last day is today where one can apply for the exchange so that the authorities manage to issue a new driver 's license until end of the year .
However , the department does n't fear that hundreds of thousands drivers go onto the streets without a valid driving right after New Year .
According to the authorities those which do n't want to drive any more have n't exchanged their driver 's license mainly .
While little places are reporting a declining of the interest in the Füherscheinumtausch strongly , still the offices of the capital are showered with applications and the interest in the exchange grew this week .
The municipal authority attends to about 2000 customers daily .
One must line up approximately one half hour .
Approx . 140000 drivers have n't exchanged their driver 's license in Prague yet .
The exhibition lasts for 20 days one new driver 's license .
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with an abbreviated period of five days .
In this case the driver but 500 crowns for this purpose numbers must .
A fine threatens drivers as of January who do n't create the specified exchange until end of the year and drive off without a valid driver 's license .

However , one thousand crown punishment threatens nobody unite according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport , Karel Hanzelka .
The driver 's license is a document at which everybody can decide whether he wants to have it or not .
It is n't an identity card , that one of everybody , and to be more precise one valid , must have .
People who do n't want to drive any more should hand in their driver 's license .
It suffices to take him to the responsible local authority or to send him by certified mail there .

The validity of driver 's licenses which were issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013 .
According to Hanzelka it is all about about 2.6 million of additional driver 's licenses .

Pains of the Labour party
Gordon Brown still has discovered another pit to the Hineinfallen ; his way out of this remains the same .
For British scandals this is n't particularly slippery .
No titles seem sold , paid no politician 's Parisians hotel bills , no extramarital toes been sucked to be .
But the uncovering has that this would got by good the without , report , missed that and , a rich businessman covered people donations up for the British ruling Labour party about more than 650,000 pounds ( 1.3 million dollars ) over four years under the name of others have the party has this is something disputed Gordon Brown .
Offending the intelligence of the brits in a stupid way when the governor had escaped the demand for a choice two months ago by claiming that opinion polls would n't have influenced this decision , there was hope that he would offer a robust , efficient government .
This one liberally expressed democrats , it like Vince Cable , the increasingly astute representation chairman instead , the once dreaded Brown has developed from Stalin into Mr. Bean .
The clumsy rescue of Northern skirt , a shattered bank , showed regulatorische weakness and bad discernment under fire .
Badly thought-out suggestions for the change of the revenue laws have set enterprise associations against the government .
The tax official loss of person-related data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative bunglings .
A trio of generals in the retirement started a rebellion in the upper house as a protest against abridgements of armed forces expenditure : They claimed so , it is a part-time job to be a secretary of the forces .
There are the various donations of David Abrahams now ; Peter Watt , Labours Secretary General ( and its former fulfillment leader ) already are stepped down .
Irrevocably direction hands over nothing meant by it to Brown that bursts .
Governments can nevertheless reach a turning point after which they feel it to rule by no means .
Still being allowed to trust people politicians but they usually hold their scepticism back if a new troop seizes the office .
If it is clear once that it is improbable that a prime minister improves the situation and he does n't need even to be long yet , this delay is past : the public service starts to get leaky ; the cabinet secretaries start to talk ; the press is looking for bad news ; and the government gets defensive and aimless .
In a way the position of Brown is particularly difficult because he can not claim unlike other political leaders to be a new broom .
So like to deny Tony Blair it would , it was his first lieutenant .
The problems with Northern skirt and the tax responsibility documents for example hangs together with decisions which Brown as a chancellor of the Treasury took .
In Blair 's mishap , as in the case of the long `` financial for title '' examination of a political party financing , the voters possibly assume and even if the notly direct involviert was that it was it .
Browns situation is nevertheless not quite as bad as it looks
The transgressions are n't as terrible as the conservatives describe them .
Mr. is Bean , nobody died or became completely beschwindelt as in the case of .
And the antidote , painful may be like it , are handed in , had what promised Browns of course Stalinist trends always : A reliable , solid and easy brutal government .
The new to-do around political donations is a good example .
He says to the garboeske Abrahams which compares its donations with its charitable gifts no public recognition wishes for his goodwill .
This may be perhaps so but the decision on it was n't entitled to it .
The laws against anonymity for tall political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason : the public has a right to know closed whom himself , entrance to the can buy , which rules over the land .
This one says , he would have of Abraham 's agreement known about but not that it is illegal watt gets himself natural some questions must arise ; exact like Jon Mendlesohn , Labours main finance recoverer whom the strange donations were told about in October .
But , till now , Brown is n't involved : There is nothing that indicates that he knew about these confusions although the largest portion of the payments was made after his assumption of office post in June .
The prime minister has taken care of the half of the work till now .
He has the violation of the laws by his party sentenced in the retirement and a judge fast he diluted this determination to fill measure up around which by reaching for a known instrument , a commission of inquiry to the topic , led , however , of a bishop .
In this case the `` teachings to be drawn from it '' are n't very complicated .
If the law was broken , it is a thing for the police .
There are except for it other things the Mr Brown must , in the public life , to find a permanent chairman how a little for the independent committee for standards which has been unoccupied for six months and to make progress with a radical reform of a political party financing make .
It would require this of the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and perhaps to give up the special financial relation with the labor unions , bitter pills for a party member like Mr Brown .
But he should be conscious of some biassed facts .
The conservatives have a clear leadership in the opinion polls now ; he has two years to win voters back ; and the only way how it can reach a victory is competence by incontestable honesty and solid .

Budget is through
Yes , it is done .
The national budget is approved .
What is special at this household ?
It is the first household which this government has designed and which was accepted by the coalition majority without support of the opposition .
This one for the current year still was approved with support of the CSSD ( social democrats ) because secretary Sobotka had him presented ( of this party ) and the CSSD could n't permit itself therefore to decline him .
As opposed to the lively debate before the coordination on the motion of 'no confidence ' against the government nothing dramatic happened this time .
The parliament approved this traditionally little observed , nevertheless most meaningful law at due leisure .
This is so to speak paradoxical .
Rules over everything starts and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the household whether one likes this or not .
The household is an essential component of the politics , however , is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition .
This is a more grateful topic for the media and therefore they pay more attention to him .
A quarrel under politicians is much more interesting than bare numbers for the public .
The national budgets suffered at the former social-democratic governments from three weak points which the household can not remove suddenly for the year 2008 :
The first is , of the high share of expenditure this one is obliging because of law in which it the pensions is n't only but also around social expenditure which the `` silent '' coalition has concluded of CSSD and KSCM ( Communists ) last year before the elections .
The second is the budgetary policy in deficit as a result of the first weak point .
The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances , i.e . the budget deficits of the municipalities .
The greatest risk , however , is n't the state budget deficit .
This household is public and one javelin measures under control .
However , a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities .
Many mayors often distributed rashly to develop further sources apart from takings from taxes , taxes and bank loans for investments debentures by which they were responsible for their city halls in excess .
Within the last few years they managed to pay these debts off by sale of shares of the energy and different one supply grids which had got them in the train of the privatization from the state on a massive scale .
This source has already dried up now .
As far as we only hold on to official and verifiable facts , we notice that :
our economy already for some years , like the rest of the world , a growth phase passes , without the CSSD this one refrain himself boasts .
This represented a single opportunity for her governments , to fix the public finances .
These governments were , however , still more responsible for the state instead .
Other countries , except for a couple of exceptions like Hungary Albania , Pakistan or Egypt have economized much more sensibly than our republic .
This is a giant disgrace which has to be ascribed to the former governments mainly .
We belong to the countries which are threatened by poverty least , seen in the global scale .
Therefore no nassiven social programs which unfortunately were inflated quite superfluously in a gigantic extent just within the last few years are necessary .
Even if it has turned out well to cut a part of the nonsensical populistic expenditure which was adopted this year before the elections is clear that if it does n't come to a moving of the pension admission age and to a reform of pensions in the near future , any politics then ends practically in this country and , who is identically on the power , will it have nothing as managing purely .
It is exaggerated only easily if one says that ruling politicians then turn into officials who mechanically divide the largest portion of the tax revenue up on pensions and social expenditure .
Therefore this year 's household can not be a revolution but can put a stop to only the superseding of normal expenditure by duty expenditure .
The deficit provided for 2008 of 70 billion crowns definitely would n't be governments superfluously , if earlier would have distributed , what went only within the last ten years .
If we do n't want that it really comes to that , that ruling politicians turn into pure civil servants , then we must be patient and wish this not too strong coalition government , however , which is conscious of this one that the state can spend much only in such a way as it is able to take to taxes and charges quiet at the preparations for broader reform laws .
Only these make a gradual putting through of a balanced national budget possible .

In the empire of Angela Wolke
The unrealistic appearance of the chancellor documented , that the coalition is as regards content at the end and that nothing more has to be expected by it itself .
In which country does this Federal Chancellor live actually ?
After her hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag which was wurschtig and meaningless one must say : not here -- not in the country which must finally be ruled over by it .
Angela Merkel has rejected the reproach that she concentrates on the foreign policy too much with a terribly arrogant sentence .
This is provincial , she said and showed with that first that she does n't want to understand about what it is for the critics .
She has become evident in the Bundestag recognizably for everyone as the reproach is very correct .
Concrete interest still even to feel a feeling was in the country for the problems there .
Angela Wolke presented itself instead : a lifted politician who flees in the foreign policy and stays there in the approximate one herself .
Example climate protection : She praises herself without breaking for the decisions of saint dam , however , does n't say how the climate goals shall be accomplished in this country there .
The self praise still would so much have the CDU boss denied herself to Unbescheidenheit two years ago at all .
She clings to the set phrase , that now the upswing arrives with the people .
It damages its image as a pragmatist instead of the world schönzureden with that who solves problems .
But domestic problems are a side issue in the empire of Angela Wolke .
Child poverty and the worries of the low wage-earners ?
She has a couple of subordinate clauses for it .
Is characteristic how often she makes a mistake as it around the child surcharge goes .
Merkel needs three attempts there to bring out a partly even sentence .
She stumbles like on a strange land if it gets concrete .

Simply is n't Richard Gere cynically enough
`` The Hunting party '' and `` dreadful peace '' deal with two films with the Balkankrieg again .
But both do n't convince .
The concepts put too much on action and Geballer or else they are too touching either .
Richard Gere can not help in `` The Hunting party '' there either .
The good news first : The war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans but the actors ' Richard Gere has been found again now there in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnia war of all things .
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighties from the eyes last because too many nice inconsequential roles cured one of the inclination for looking in well feeling films for women and too many press conferences to the Buddhism topic .
Richard is suddenly javelins the most important argument , himself , The Hunting party `` -- if the hunter becomes the chased `` now why look ? ) perhaps anyway , today , film titles must always be so long and confused actually like train driver wage agreements .
He delivers a wonderfully winking representation : His war reporter Simon Hunt is , taken in the reason this what would have been able to be from javelin if destiny and the film industry were not so merciful : Decline has still a man his who has his very best times behind himself for a long time kept considerable remains of the former charm this one but himself as a monument identical in ruin .
But despite this trump `` The Hunting party '' together with the German production , `` dreadful peace '' , which also starts this week continues only the endless row of failed Balkankriegs films .
`` Dreadful peace '' can with one put on a short trial : The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo ( Adrian Topol , Max Riemelt ) who save a Serbian from kosovarischen snipers , on whom the one promptly also falls in love with them .
Although it is welcome that , once , the Serbians are n't represented as an only root of all evil here , the television flat film loses itself fast too in Geballer and action .
However , it remains a kind of `` alarm for Cobra 11 '' without freeway for this with war .
On the other hand , can be investigated virtually exemplarily to `` The Hunting party '' why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie actually .
Perhaps a new `` Apocalypse Now '' could have become the story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to `` the fox '' track down the Serbian top war criminal with another director and a different one scriptwriter ( both into personal union Richard Shepard ) at another time .
Because the Storys are alike frappierend : Small teams do n't go what the armed forces both times to the woods it becomes a journey into the insanity be able to to accomplish something and both times .
One is one of the reasons for the failure of `` The Hunting party '' that Simon Hunt does n't simply let the shabby cynic as whom he is introduced to us at the beginning be with heart .
A romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian andichten murdered later must still no the script for it on top of everything .
Definitely , `` The Hunting party '' goes the creek down then if the reporters succeed in the time-lapse photography method within the last five minutes which Nato , CIA and all headhunters of the world have n't made within five years : Catching the war criminal and leaving to the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge .
This is so bad that one would like to call the international court of justice in The Hague against the cinema logic because of crimes .
The film has a deeply human request .
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still run around freely and he does n't suspect the Americans and the Frenchmen ( here shall they agree for once ) to do the following due to secret political arrangements too intensively .
But are so similarly the thought well and the bad one sometimes that a famous Brecht poem comes one into the meaning .
It is called in it over the wood mask of an Asian demon on the work-table of the poet : `` I sympathetically see the swollen veins in the temple , indicating : how exhausting it is to be bad `` .
Films like `` The Hunting party '' have exactly such swelling heads which , however , indicate how exhausting , well to be , it is .
The problem is n't limited on the genre of the Balkankriegsfilms .
Recently is in this newspaper reports got , that all Iraq films of Hollywood were large flops .
One can add : There has never been a good South Africa film , too .
Be almost always valid : If a starling knocks around on the flash points or minefields of the world , then something like that comes out like `` Rangoon '' with Patricia Arquette , `` hereafter of all limits '' , with Angelina Jolie or `` blood diamonds '' with Leonardo DiCaprio .
All the conflicts are possibly from the point of view of time simply still too near .
After all , decades had to pass before Hollywood with `` Schindler 's list '' could shoot a good film about the holocaust .
Many a film still will well mature , the Vietnam plants `` The Deer Hunter '' , `` Apocalypse Now '' being regarded as a classic now or `` Full Metal jacket '' has unanimously at that time yes not at all been celebrated as masterpieces .
But perhaps we know , where on the same two screens today every mass murder in real time amounts at home , also simple too much about the conflicts of the world .
And this robs the film script authors of the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs to tell good stories .
Yes , his or nonexistence has therefore got so good , after all , because Lubitsch and Chaplin did n't know yet how badly there was really the Nazi regime `` `` or `` the great dictator '' , too .
Perhaps one must n't want to be good if one wants to make good films .
Perhaps one must have the sarcastically distant artist look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk .
When this one was questioned to parallels between his historical novel `` Lemprières dictionary '' and the Balkankrieg , he answered : `` This only lies that some things never change .
Cities will always be terribly dangerous , people will always be murdered in a terrible way and war always will be in Yugoslavia . ''

Two of juvenile girls had the police to step in on a Slovakian immigrant also after an attack .
The girls had made allegedly racialist remarks and thrown stones at him opposite the man .
`` When we went home , a boy climbed a bus cottage and spat on us .
When I told him he should stop another unpleasant occurrence he threw apples and pears at us and laid bare then his buttocks , `` a nut of Slovakian pupils described the newspaper The Timeses .
Troubles come from the two sides .
One of the natives even described the quarrel with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as an over-life fight .
The specified cases attest the fact that the atmosphere gets tenser and tenser between natives and immigrants at British schools .
70000 Slovaks who came onto looking for work here are reported in Great Britain .
About 30000 Slovakian pupils therefore attend British schools .

And the six per cent of the Hungarian
As Secretary of the announced , the expert meetings on Tuesday , and at the end of the debate about the international after 2012 by the ministers on Wednesday , according to the official opening of continued .
Experts and politicians from 192 countries to discuss the schedule of Bali , in which the measures for the period after 2012 , thus after the end of the Kyoto Protocol are fixed .
At present , an intense debate is under way between industry and developing countries .
The USA has already , that they do not want to negotiate about concrete figures , though , they would be ready to 2020 the greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990 , in order to reduce percent .
The big question is whether the Conference are ready , in addition to the reduction of emissions , the developing countries both financially and technologically .
It was also an agreement about the support achieved by developing countries .
The Fund is to put the Kyoto Protocol to be administered by a 16-koepfigen advice , presumably at the Global Environment Facility ( gef ) of the UN , as in the `` piac profit '' read .
Hungary six per cent
Secretary of the supplementary in the name of Hungary the effort of the European Union , its pioneering role in global to maintain , and to achieve a new international agreement to 2009 .
The Minister said that the European Union until 2020 the greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2010 ( measured against the values of 1990 ) , regardless of whether the `` agreement after 2012 '' successfully achieved or not , the Union would be even ready for a reduction , other large industrial nations of the world , or developing countries are also ready to their obligations to forces and responsibly .
Of the stressed that the objective of the States which had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 , a reduction of only 5.2 % , whereas the European Union with its back to a minus 15 Member States have already committed by 8 % .
The guideline for Hungary is reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 % in comparison with the years - a handicap , the country will quite meet , such as in the press release of the Ministry of the environment is to be read .
The employment is high in Bali - after all , the long-term international agreement must be ready within two years , otherwise it would certainly only enter into force after 2012 , which in this case would established in the Kyoto Protocol is not renewed , international consequences , whose importance also the IPCC , the international , with the Nobel Peace Prize distinguished Scientific Committee of the UN in its most recent report has stressed .
Through the emission reduction would be delayed , and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable , which according to the extremely serious and irreparable consequences for would entail .

For this , that it is a given a name , it was presented for a court in Khartoum today .
After indicating their lawyer , the British teacher in the Sudan , because an insult of Islam had been accused on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days of detention and following classification .
The Briton was accused of six to seven year allow students to have a bear the name Mahomet to give , although any representation of the prophet is prohibited .
They have earned it .
After parents of pupils several times with the Sudanese had complained to the Ministry of education , education and cultural , of the high school of unity was active , on Sunday to be taken up at home and according to Article 125 of the Sudanese penal code to the insult of Islam .
In fact , this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher their pupils six to seven year to choose a name for the choice .
The children suggest eight names , including Hassan , Abdullah and Mohammed , reports Robert boules .
Finally , when the select class votes to 20 of 23 children Mohammed as like first name .
Certainly , Mohammed is the name of the Prophet , but above all , as well as a first name very frequent in Sudan .
Then the children a book for the class , with the photo of the bear on this and the `` my name Mohammed .
The bear did not carry a label with this name , but the problem is , quite simply , that the representation of the prophet of Islam is regarded as an insult .
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons at the same school teaches in Sudan , said that he knows it well , and they would never have done something with which they could get a religious faith too near , I only regret that it has asked the children , for a name to vote his opinion is only an innocent error .
An opinion , numerous pupils of the teacher share these as very attentive to their pupils and as a person who never talks about religion in the class describes .
It considers that the first name of Mohammed simultaneously in Great Britain on even the most frequent given , for which in English 14 different exists .
This first name often selected by Muslim families is regarded as a kind of respect in the prophet ( it is frequently the given a family ) .
But what are the rules in the reference to the use of this ?
One may give a toy him for example ?
This is of course a matter of interpretation .

In many places you
This year , more than a thousand infections in hospitals that due to inappropriate handling antibiotics .
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals , the overcrowding of beds , the overload of staff - all factors , the checking the infections is not good at all , as the leading doctor of the national .
In many cases , even in the case of the you .
In the traumatologie of to hospital , a mrsa-infection was diagnosed recently .
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient , after a serious accident to the hospital .
The patient was isolated .
At the beginning of the year , there was already a similar infection here .
The injured a serious car accident was released from the hospital , a little later , the man had to return , however , with a mrsa-infection an important operation could since then , because of the , which is still in the body of the patient is not yet to be carried out .
Until 10 December of this year from hospitals activated by virus infections initiated at the national nosocomialis surveillance system , as the leading doctor of the national , .
So many activated by virus released infections were registered certainly in the hospitals , the true figure may be higher .
Approximately two thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) were by the against methicillin-oxacillin of resistant triggered .
The staphylococcus ( SA ) bacterium contributes approximately one third of the people in their nose , without that it would cause an illness .
SA limited infections ( such as inflammation of tonsillitis , inflammations of skin or wounds ) usually react to antibiotics well , they are well curable .
The means are however measured out too high or used arises from the good respondierenden antibiotics resistant bacteria under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly develop .
In the case of patients with or permanently bad immune system , but also in age or patients with a low weight can these bacteria serious infections , such as infection or , therefore , cause .
The head of the medical according to hospital is nothing special , such incidents life .
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic , manhte a - there are not only there , where it is not searched .
Resistant to antibiotics
`` such patients are isolated , the nursing staff carry rubber and masks at the supply , and we have the necessary for the treatment antibiotics - so .
With their admission to the hospital , the patients are examined , nevertheless an infection can always be avoided .
Sampling too rarely
The majority of the initiated by infections in hospitals , would be avoidable , though the currently prevailing conditions and conditions for the checking of containment of origin or the spread of the virus , says .
After this infection mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly , the taken patients should investigate and mrsa-infected isolate immediately .
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not , however , so frequently practised .
Last but not least because it on the part of the national health any subsidies for this investigation .
The most cases would come to light before then , if the patient is already a noticeable , according to the medical his of .
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations to the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine , there are , however , also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes .
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be called microbiological studies are necessary , so that any resistance to the funds can form , however , this directive of hospitals , does not always adhered to .
Under the or in the basic supply patients microbiological sampling are even more rarely , so .
You will at the
Scientific evidence to prove that of a patient , on the other , on the most frequent transfer of nursing staff .
So the hand washing or carrying gloves and masks a great importance , however , there is also considerable shortcomings in this area in the hospitals .
To is transmitted through droplet or contact in the local hospitals , however , it is not always possible to isolate the patients .
The rooms are even often overcrowded , the beds connected barely , although it is between them from the point of view of the epidemiological a distance of at least 1.5 meters should be .
As karolina keep saying , it happens unfortunately in financially less well placed hospitals , even before that , in the case of you , there are few nurses , many patients - all factors which almost favour the emergence of infections .
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further spread of the virus can be stopped , where these protective measures are adhered to , so .
The government program against to
In the grasp to get causes enormous costs for the health insurance , so they are fought everywhere .
In England , for example , the prevention of to , or their containment was held in the government program .
After the first signs of the program is successful , as published data prove the tendency of the declining in England .

The test Peugeot 207 1.6 1.6 : voruteile shrink
To tell the truth , I was never a special fan the Peugeot 206 .
His were not much value , the quality of which refer to the control and also the processing , one could describe as rather below average .
But now its successor , the Peugeot 207 , on the market , and this is much better .
The combination of with the name sw is still a piece of further , and it only remains for me to revise my opinion .
As I had tested the classical hatchback 207 , I had to me , for example , about the low on the rear seats .
There are now no longer these complaints , because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer .
Fast further
I have only just go through , in order not to repeat me too much .
It is a quite excellent design , where I only because of the miserable central tunnel 's objections .
There I would welcome a little more designerische organization , where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression .
The seats are comfortable and are the times past , where we perhaps have to short seats or .
Also , in comparison with the 206 substantially .
What the space concerns here , one can also feel the increased dimensions of the body .
In combination is also the already mentioned the lack of eliminated .
In the trunk suitcases
The main point at this car is , however , the cargo hold .
I must now also because of the reverse ) as a very good loadable and space-saving .
The cavities are equipped with safety belts , which represent an ideal compromise .
They do not disturb can and do even more difficult objects .
However , we talk about the drawer volume .
It is according to table in the basic equipment 428 in comparison with the competition , which is a rather average value .
However , not in comparison with the vehicle of this class , the ? fabia , .
If we have the 207 1.6 with the new generation of product from Mladá Boleslav compare , we find that the Peugeot by clearly perceptible 52 behind .
For a foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical .
But in order to emphasize the positiva , I must still the according to the whole of the down mention turning back seats or even the very low mention .
120 transportation in four numbers
It was with a capacity of 1.6 litres and with an output of 88 equipped .
And , frankly , should look like a family , a family .
It is low , has a low consumption and moves away well .
If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda , which sometimes seems as if its with a rag clogged , then I can only be inspired by him .
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national .
However , we must remember that we have a good car equipped with a spacious innneren and a very good engine .
The basic price of cars with the 1400th petrol engine at the level of 329900 crowns still concerns .
With our engine it costs as 410900 Crowns which is already quite a lot .
The equipment of the strikes once again with 80000 crowns besides .
We had , however , automatic air bags , automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters back and and ...
So the car costs in total simple 531900 crown .
That is a lot , but you calculate the options of a fabia once and they will arrive with a very similar sum .
Therefore , only the decision , which mark one wants to choose .

Budget is through
Yes , it is done .
The budget is approved .
What is special one at this budget ?
It is the first budget which this government has designed and without support the opposition was accepted by the .
For the current year still with the support of the ssd ( social democrats ) approved because it Minister ( of this party ) had submitted , and it therefore could not allow to reject it .
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no against the government nothing dramatic happened this time .
The Parliament approved this traditionally considered , nevertheless , some highly meaningful law calmly .
This is to a certain extent paradoxical .
This rule begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget , whether one likes or not .
The budget is an essential component of the policy , however , is covered by the power of the government and the opposition .
This is a subject for the media , and therefore they devote more attention to it .
A fight among politicians is much more interesting for the public as a bare figures .
The national budgets suffered at the last social democratic governments under three weak points , the budget for the year 2008 , not at the same time can eliminate :
The first is the high proportion of expenditure , because of law obliging , whereby it is not only about the pensions , but also about social , the `` implicit '' coalition of ssd and ksm ( Communist ) in the last year before the choices .
The second is the account budget policy as a result of the first .
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances , i.e . the deficits of the local authorities .
The greatest risk is not , however , the state budget deficit .
This budget is public and eingermassen under control .
However , a true time bomb is the deficit of the local authorities .
Many mayors distributed by except gains from taxes , and bank loans further sources for investments , often mostly bonds , through which they their in excess responsible .
In the last few years they managed to these debts by massive sales of stocks of energy and other supply networks , in which they had received from the State to pay off .
Now this source already dried up .
As far as we only at official and verifiable facts , we find that :
Our economy for some years , like the rest of the world , a growth through which the incessantly himself boasts .
This represented a unique opportunity for their governments , public finances in order .
Instead , these governments were to the state , however , still more .
Other countries , apart from a few exceptions , such as Hungary , Pakistan , Albania or Egypt have much more reasonable than our Republic .
This is a giant disgrace , which mainly be ascribed to the former governments .
We are among the countries that , seen in the global scale , at least are threatened by poverty .
Therefore , no nassiven social which , unfortunately , just in the last few years very in gigantic extent was blown up .
Even if it is successful , a part of the absurd populist expenditure , which were adopted this year before the elections , to delete if it is clear that in next time not to a shift of the pension entry age and to a pension , then virtually any policy in this country , and , all the same , who is in power , he will not have anything as pure administration .
It is only slightly exaggerated , if one says that then from the dominant politicians , civil servants are the largest part of the tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social divide .
Therefore , this year 's budget can not be a revolution , but it can only the expulsion of normal expenditure by duty areas .
The planned for 2008 deficit of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if former governments not spent in the last ten years , which would have only worked .
If we do not want that it really comes to that from the dominant politicians pure verwaltungsbeamte , then we must be patient and that is not too strong coalition government , however , which is conscious of the fact that the State , just as much as it can take to taxes and charges in the situation is , rest with the preparation of further wish .
Only these make a gradual enforcement of a balanced budgets .

What insurance is suitable for me the best ?
The insurance , a possible claim caused by the driver covers , contains a high cost , whose level of various factors depends , among other things , of age , sex , the time of the creation of the driving licence , kind of the insured , cars and its use , etc .
To have a car is only the beginning .
Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance as the right vehicle model .
First , it must be clear to one with which we have to do it here .
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder .
This agreement is in writing by means of a versicherungsvertrags held , which specifies that the society receives and in exchange is engaged in a claim the corresponding compensation .
The premium is the price of an insurance consists through several factors , and other age , sex , the time of the creation of the driving licence , type of vehicle to be insured or its use .
The insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics , so that , in the event of a higher danger of accident , even higher payments due .
For this reason both via women make less payments , because statistics prove that these groups , thanks to their caution show a lower accident rate .
The same also applies to married people , since these after statement of the statistical values and therefore also for being one of the enterprise , fewer accidents tend as singles .
The use of the vehicle is attributed to influences the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident .
The more frequently the use , the more probable the damage .
With the installation of the insurance premium must consider a whole series of points .
For this reason the driver must also study the situation thoroughly exactly the car insurance to select the most likely approaches his personal needs .
We do this now , the most important points , the one with the selection of an insurance should take into account , in order not only an achievement - but also a oriented choice to be able to meet .
The less than 25-year-old meetings with the choice of a reasonably priced insurance numerous obstacles , such as the small and the `` young '' driving licence .
Even if it is for an ideal insurance cover best would be a sign , there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives .
The careful drivers can select a full hull with , so that the services of a were covered , but at a low price offered .
This type of contract contains that the customer a portion of the amount resulted from the damage must pay .
The amount is before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the premium ; this is more highly the smaller the sum to explain Luis Noguera , main agent of Spain with Europe , an arrangement for on-line .
Another option is the extended insurance , the customer against external damages , however , against the damages developed at the own car .
In addition to this kind of insurance theft , fire and vehicle loss .
Here is a piece of advice .
If you are under 25 years old , it is in your hand to lower the cost of insurance ; so your credit increases by trying to travel and to avoid accidents .
A credit is a reduction in the case of the appropriate insurance company .
In the opposite to contain a payment an increase of said rate .
The amount of credits and punishing payments depend on the society and their returns .
If the enterprise a rich year behind it , can allow itself to increase , explains .
As soon as the exceeded it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract . Reason for this is the fact that with increasing the accident rate sinks .
Therefore , it is the most sensible for a full with deduction to decide .
Usually the young people can not profit from their previous experience , both in the case of an accident as at the time of the driving not to describe the practice of the European enterprise , and adds that the majority of the accidents in the second occur after the fear of beginner .
Nevertheless , it is in the case of a married customers , who does not possess children a sign ; of course , only then , if it is the financial situation of the appropriate person also allows .
On the part of married couples with children as the customers with the lowest accident rate , and correspondingly low also their payments .
In this case , would be a fully with deduction ( at an amount around 300 Euros . ) , the best option in the case that one received a high credit , recommends an extended insurance , the first for the third year .
You go in total relaxed and have a greater purchasing power , which allows them to a larger contribution payment determine Luis Noguera .
It is good for pensioners , with a full deduction ( at an amount around 150 euro ) , or an extended insurance which does only at a sufficiently high credit .
Finally , one must observe that the car insurance is something very important , not only because it protects the driver against possible , but also because it high costs , which require it , that a thorough choice is made , which corresponds to our personal situation .

The choice of the status quo
On Sunday , it will at the counting of the case does not get : the mass of the Russians for President Putin 's party , United Russia .
After a very much election campaign , it confirms its striving for stability , even after authoritarianism .
Three days before the parliamentary elections choices , the Russian President Vladimir Putin an information broadcast on the public senders to the voters , which was already recorded , whose contents are kept secret , however .
It does this in its quality as candidate of the United Russia , for which an overwhelming victory announces itself .
Yesterday the President looked through when he received the foreign ambassadors , and was content , a new attack against the West , to provide the accused of the interference of its subject during the election campaign .
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections , extremely transparent and open elections without trickery , he added .
From the point of view of the opposition , since they have wasted .
It prangert stained by suppressing a campaign .
The Communist leaders günnadi ziouganov says , it would never have been such dirty choices , not even in the time of eltsin .
According to the suppression of the demonstrations at last weekend , applies Garry for bad demonstrating to five days of detention had been sentenced , according to its advocate further ban .
The Russians have the mentality of the Homo sovieticus ?
According to this Parliament without tension , many leading two questions :
Who will succeed as a President ?
The office has yesterday , the date of the first round of the presidential elections announced , 2 March 2008 ; the candidates have time until 23 December to make themselves known .
Since it was elected in 2000 and 2004 again , Vladimir Putin is not for a third mandate in sequence .
And now is no successor .
What role will play Putin after March ?
Prime Minister ?
Chairman of the majority in Parliament and the all-powerful party United Russia , the government and the President will select ?
Whatever it is , with the Parliament or with the presidential elections , the previous power will triumph .
This is tradition .
The Russians have the mentality of the Homo sovieticus , they are not wishing to their fate , means the sociologist lev director of the independent Center levada .
The historians Nikolai from the State University St. Petersburg goes even further back : the civil society in this country , the five centuries to Europe was only very slowly ; the famous Community spirit has delayed the development of individuality .
According to the liberal reforms of the nineties Putin again to the model of a paternalistic state , which was completely accepted by the population , all the more since no terror followed on this new paternalism , but a certain economic prosperity , Maria lipman means of the Carnegie Foundation .
Today the Russians renounce `` voluntarily with the personal responsibility , which they after the collapse of the USSR , for a short time to put the day .
What still for a long time ?
This phenomenon affects all social classes , including the business community .
And the administration understands it , to keep the status quo : 65 governors ( of 85 Russian ) lead the local lists of United Russia .
The new , coming from the West freedoms are often tantamount to chaos , such as in the nineties .

At the most expensive , Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in also have this year , the average increase in prices of 16 % of the last year , with the difference that it this year no increase in the value-added tax .
Article from napi gazdaság
In the budaörser the price of the usual Christmas `` napi '' also this year around 16 % were increased , but in all price increases of over per registered .
After the prices in the food markets in the last December `` , '' , the price increase not out to be drastically , compared with the already high , former level .
However , it has an effect on the consumers , certainly as a deterrent , that , in the last year for which they still far less had paid hoof , this year , not even for 10,000 is available .
The price of the `` napi '' shopping basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof examined in the markets .
The highest price amounted hoof .
( was the price at 6.800 . )
The prices for unicum and live fish , almost on increased strongly , however the prices for nut and poppy .
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary , when there was , however , for 139 forint .
It was with the product limited price slump with no less than 200 forint .
Surprising was here two Coca-Cola , the price of a bottle of less than 200 forint , thus including the drink cost pledge only 257 .
Nevertheless this year in the `` napi '' at the most expensive , and at best .
Our calculations indicate that the prices in the `` napi '' shopping basket with the Christmas in the last year , around 15 , while Tesco and cut each around 18 per cent .
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12 % , while the increase between shopping basket of last year and the current year constituted 21 % .
The average rise in prices was 1.480,00 .
The average increase in prices in the previous case was still 1,206.00 , however , the tax increase with the prices at last Christmas apparent .
Exactly this process has met the trade badly : apparently the department stores could not so right to decide what price margin they should use in the individual articles , since the effects of the increase in prices to the consumer were unforeseeable .
( if the vendor the peripheral speed of a product badly plans , it can by substantial profits fall in the price margin , after the choices ) .
The price increase of the `` napi '' goods in the past year so radically , that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 by 1720 exceeded , whereas the price difference at the cheapest basket only 844 forint fraud .
Such extremes were not observed this year , since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 forint more than in the previous year , and even with the cheapest , there was a rise in prices of forint .
In comparison with the two last Christmas showed a catastrophic price increase the price of the daily consumer items on the in less than 20 months by more than 30 % .
( this is not necessarily again confirms the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary , with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months , a more than a price increase .
So in addition to flour as well , for example in the case of eggs . )
If one takes a look , however , in the `` napi '' shopping basket , this seems almost impossible with the latter , since the price of the product is already in the previous year , even in the worst case by little more than 10 per cent .
Obviously are in a stronger position than the egg - after all , they could the drastic price increase pass on to the multinationals .
In the golden deplore the hypermarkets not ; it is constantly about good years .
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more .
From all large quantities bought , lasting food go in over the counters .
Wednesday morning there was in all three department stores endless with the cash as suddenly the number of customers exploded .
However , the country is a smaller frequency reports , so that many multinationals with complain , they could not even reach the planned turnover , and not only in the case of food , but also with lasting materials .

England confronted with decision about the statements of owais Shah and
Here two dilemmas , each of them almost as difficult as the others .
Who is as number 6 for England in kandy at this weekend , owais Shah or ravi , ?
And not less relevant in a broader context than the first test to Sri Lanka , who is to make the decision ?
The second question is important because the David youthful , on call at least under this specific title , is here , about the Peter bog and the captain Michael Vaughan to help to decide , and because of the table of high morries , the English managing director , gradually , with applications for national fills , if not even for what in part-time .
Whoever does not get the sixth will be unfortunate , but that life is often unfair and sport , it is beyond doubt .
It is never easy to nail exactly what a human being made it possible to reach the point of his profession , while someone else about the lowest rank , sometimes from lack of luck instead of capability .
It is not only necessary in , where the choice is difficult , where judgments which are always at the end of subjective .
Is it the right time for , gross ?
It is fair to Shah if he does it ?
The same can perhaps also in a wider area be asked whether , for example , John Edward `` or '' , both intelligent young with good conclusions , the business well knows , should be promoted .
Who can say what the right class for a one-day , unless it the possibility given to sink or swim .
Of course numbers have a big influence on decisions , but are also have this .
Within a team must a one-day the eye of the captain at the right time catch , if it can take a and a bat must regular opportunities on the right , if it wants to do impression as a one-day .
The eyes of the to catch is more complicated .
There were many who in the last season better than , for example , as James Anderson were apparent in the first test will play , even if Stephen pronounces itself for healthy and as the wind in the networks .
Anderson included 32 Prime wickets per 33 to earn a position in this route .
Chris tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average , but both had their points and hope to still more .
Whether Shah or , in the asgiriya stage is , can only be .
The choice could decide the careers of both men , or perhaps , however , it makes little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka played Gareth batty in each test and was successful in the first , with five wickets and useful to 40 , it was , however , Paul , then still fightingly in order to consolidate the breakthrough to a significant testkricketspieler created and , although it is a double one hundred against in Australia , perhaps still underestimated .
It is probable that youthful Vaughan and moorland , after a further discussion in the course of the present in the asgiriya stage their conservative instincts and 's greater experience about net enthusiasm will follow .
There are arguments for both of them .
For Shah speak its sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay , 43 first-class hundreds , and only six of the seven years younger with 22 years , and an excellent balance against bullets .
However , Shah made only ten runs in its two innings in May against the West in the test in Lord , its as a player from middlesex , and this , plus its immediate rejection of the as Vaughan was well , about his position for the next game , seems to take back the momentum from its suggest to have taken the still in Bombay was obvious .
In contrast , the Jack of all trades from Essex Essex .
It is of no one impressed and its attitude off this was taken to the point when he recently with a vehicle in an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen had estimated .
He suffered from smaller injuries and probably a shock , but first , which he did was to be Vodafone ( of course also gesponsort ) out and its Cook ask who had observed this from the distance and with enthusiasm to say : `` have you seen this ? `` .
, is a much better , be it with some effect here on the grounds , which seems to match it and , with confidence and destiny .
The right man to select a thing is the right time to choose a different .
Perhaps that is the art of the real choice .
In addition , I incline its chance now to give , which does not mean that maybe Shah well sentence is not , however , if , as the from Ceylon suggests , it is that , will play here this weekend .

British baenker plead guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers , for their role in the fraudulent system with the former main of Enron , Andrew before the Court should be placed on Wednesday , changed their requests in communication .
David bermingham , Giles darby and Gary mulgrew had originally for seven cases of fraud by use of for the alleged with fastow in a secret finance fraud in the year 2000 in order at the expense of their employer , pleads on innocent .
The procedure had been applied for the January .
However , during a hearing before the Court in front of Ewing junior everyone pleaded for a case of fraud by use of communication .
The three former managers of Greenwich natwest , a unit of the Royal bank of Scotland group plc , were in Great Britain in the course of procedures , which lasted for two years .
In the United States , their case is a loose end of an investigation , which was started to Enrons collapse in 2001 .
The accusations originally submitted against them in the year 2002 fastow drew attention to the fact that it was the objective of an examination of the government in connection with the Enron decline .
The charges against the bankers - called the `` three '' - that they are in the year 2000 to Houston around a fraudulent conspiracy with fastow and its former Michael kopper hatch .
Greenwich natwest had a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron invested , controlled by fastow was the architect of innumerable fraudulent machinations which contributed to tear the company in bankruptcy-wobble .
At the beginning of 2002 , the Bank of the value of their participation in the subsidiary on zero appreciated , however , the three British men knew that it had considerable value in reality .
A company under koppers control acquired the parts of the Bank of the subsidiary for 1 million dollars .
The bankers paid kopper 250,000 dollars for involvement in this enterprise .
According to the accusation , wrongly in comparison with Enron , that the energy companies 20 million dollars natwest for their parts of the subsidiary would pay .
The 20 million dollars but actually went to the British bankers , fastow and others .
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars , while fastow , kopper and others about 12.3 million dollars according to the charges .
In January 2004 , declared itself in two charges on conspiracy for its role in the Enrons bankruptcy .
The British trio was arrested three months later .
Fastow serves a term of imprisonment in the of Louisiana .
Kopper serves a sentence of three years and one month in a mechanism in texarkana .
Each of the three men was on free foot due to a 1 million dollars bail , which made it necessary , that it is in the United States lived in expectation of the legal proceedings .
Enron , once the nation 's seventh largest enterprise in the bankruptcy in December 2001 , after years of tricks do not longer debts up or make weak businesses seem profitable business .
The breakdown destroyed thousands of jobs , more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans .
The Enron founder Kenneth lay and the former one executive Jeffrey skilling last year for their roles in connection with the collapse .
Skilling serves a sentence of more than 24 years .
Lays convictions for conspiracy , fraud and other charges were futile , after he died because of heart disease last year .

Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exactly , so that the practice of working days around the holidays , established in the meantime , however , give us the coming year some such days .
Also in the European Union and in America , one means something different under `` holiday '' .
The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days .
Days are mostly church holidays or stand with important historical events in context .
We celebrate new year as well , for example : both the last day of the old , when the first day of the new year , are days - already so that the latter alone can rest .
In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays .
These are the 15 March at the revolution of 1848 and 23 October , the anniversary of the revolution of 1956 .
On 20 August , the establishment of state , on 1 May the work celebrated on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead .
Furthermore there are two holidays at Easter , Pentecost and Christmas .
Since our Heads of State or religious holidays rarely on a weekend fall , the practice of the `` , '' proved itself in the cases in which we before or after the holiday , only one day would work .
The price of the prolonged weekends , though , that we on Saturdays in front of work very well , or must go to school .
When this day before or after the holiday , you should at long last be processed , since long years by the Employment Minister in its own regulation .
The legislation applies to all employers and recipients , for public employees and officials of the public service .
Only companies and facilities are excluded , in which the company without interruption , therefore , also at the holidays , continued .
This year the rules only through the holidays , at the end of the year , is somewhat mixed up : from the 24th December remains in this country really do , since most of the days between Christmas and New Year 's Eve , or the specifically for adjustment taking holidays .
In the next year fall more within the holidays or at the end of the week , so that , at the working days will be less than this year .
The calendar is around the day of the work on the head , so that the people by four days now at home can remain .
Saturday , the 26 April a working day , so that the Friday , 2 May can be a day of rest .
The second change is connected with the holiday on 23 October , on Saturday , the 18 October will be one of the Friday , 24 first of all have to process .
The end of the year will however be dominated by the holidays , after all , from the 24th December and do it even if New Year 's Eve on a Wednesday .

Six as a deterrent , in order to annoy
E-mails which we forget , we never received - harmless lies , which we do not notice : they bring `` , '' at work to the weekday .
The only question is whether one of these small used , or is it better to the challenge and tries to this misleading , aggravating for other situations .
Tips .
`` sorry that I have forgotten to pass on to you that someone from the referred - a colleague says '' .
That it has missed a meeting ?
At best , one regrets it and attempts to make it again to when one perhaps with the calls and admitting , one would have forgotten to align the report that is the usual way ) .
The thing is usually dismissed with an excuse .
Before one oneself in excuses , one should consider , with one of his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations .
Something lent , which does not belong to one ?
There is hardly a little pithier as if one according to a document or the telephone , but it is not there .
Yesterday was still on the desk - it is today ?
Or will the believed lost ballpoint pens about on a colleague 's desk ?
No one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow , because they are annoyed if they find that something disappeared .
Therefore , no covers or mail from the office in the bag because they could meet : no more , since , if one 's but urgently needs .
Gossip about the private life of the colleagues ?
There is no effective means , one of which has already been put in the world , to stop .
Who , with whom , which made ?
Where , and why ?
One should the information ( or assumptions ) on the private life of the colleagues if possible not to tie the nose !
And if someone opens and its internal secret tells us , we should not abuse this confidence !
The best one keeps quiet as a grave , instead of just is not present to adjust , even if other about the problems of the colleagues also know .
Without reason ill announced ?
If one is in office in order to present itself ill with reference to tormenting headache report because one just feels uneasy , or simply would only like to rest , one should take a clear : the work of their own , urgent , projects with fixed dates must now the colleagues instead of a themselves .
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore !
If one already knows at that one it at the next day do not get into office , or that something could interfere why one must remain at home , one should announce it in time , so that neither the colleagues , nor the boss unexpectedly confronted with the absence .
Hum , tittering , telephoning
One is right in his work deepened , but you do giggle disturbed by the colleagues ?
Unintentional a telephone conversation that one should not have heard better ?
One should not the colleagues with sums , singing , loud conversations ( one over their heads , ) moaning or permanent nerves .
All this can be very disturbing , even if it is not just in a task ( write plan , organize ) deepened .
Are the other always to blame ?
A project is not ready in due time , one has a letter or important nachrichte , one should not forget to send the fault of its own forgetfulness not with other search !
As far as possible , one should not on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues !
The best one admits his errors and excuses if others were affected by this as well !
The question of how one mistake again , or which missed retrieve can only too missed !
In the office - a feeling like to home ?
Pants and schlapfen : force for at home , but in the office lost nothing !
Not even then one should so casually dress , if it would actually permit the job !
Only not to become too - one should both his colleagues , and also itself as far as respect , that one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired , also pretty and elegant !

Richard is simply not cynically enough
With `` the party '' and `` dreadful peace '' two films deal again with Balkan war .
But both do not .
Either the drafts put too much on action and geballer or else they are to blessed .
There also Richard in `` the party did not help .
The good news first : did not hide the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still in the mountains of the Balkans , but just there , in the dark hinterland of , is now the actors Richard been found again .
We had the most beautiful man of the years finally lost sight of , because too many roles in for women and too many press conferences on the subject films , the desire to well .
Richard is suddenly the most important argument , `` the party - if the hunter to gejagten is '' ( why , today , really must always be so long and as ? ) , perhaps , but to look at .
It provides a perfect representation : in fact taken its Simon , which could have become from , if the destiny and the not so reporter who would be : a man , its very best times long behind itself , however , even as a monument its fall still considerable remains of the former themselves .
But in spite of this , `` the party '' , together with the German production `` dreadful peace '' , which also starts in this week , only the endless series of failed continues .
`` dreadful peace '' one can make short process : the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo ( Adrian topol , Max riemelt ) , a Kosovo from save on the one this also falls in love with them .
Although it is welcome that here is not the root of all evil Serbs as exclusive are represented , loses the film too quickly in geballer and action .
It remains a kind of `` alarm for 11 '' without motorway but for with war .
On the other hand , can be on `` the party '' almost exemplary , why it did not actually ever a correct good has given .
The history of three , which set out by the Serbian `` , '' the fox to trace criminal with another director and another ( both in scriptwriter Richard shepard ) to another time perhaps a new `` now '' .
Because the stories are alike yes : go both male small teams in the forest , in order to achieve something which the soldiers not able and both times it becomes a journey in the madness .
One of the reasons for the failure of `` the party '' , Simon that one is not simply the shabby cynic with heart when he presented to us at the beginning .
No , the script must it in addition still a romantic affair , with a later murdered Muslim .
Finally , `` the party '' go then the brook down if the reporters within the last five minutes succeed in the CIA which NATO , and all of the world in five years : the war criminal catch and the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge left .
This is so bad that one of the International Court of Justice in The Hague because of crimes against the call would like .
The film has a deeply human concerns .
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still freely , and he suspects , the Americans and the French ( here they should agree for once ) due to the pursuit of secret political arrangements too intensively to operate .
But this well and the bad are sometimes so similar to that a famous comes into the sense .
It is called it over the wood an Asian demon on the workbench of the poet : `` sympathetically I see the swollen : how hard it is to be bad '' .
Films as `` the party '' exactly such swelling heads , however , indicate how hard it is to be good .
The problem is not limited to the category of the limited .
Recently in this newspaper reports that all Iraq films were large flops .
One can also add : there has never been a good .
Nearly always applies : if a star on the elements or mine fields of the world , then something like this out as `` Rangoon '' with Patricia arquette `` beyond all borders '' with `` or '' blood diamonds with Leonardo dicaprio .

Venus is the twin of earth
The Venus , despite their anti-life atmosphere of the earth , as so far more similar thought : the European space probe `` Venus express '' has theory into the atmosphere and Poland 's , as they arise in the winter also on earth .
For nearly three decades assume scientists , that it is on the Venus .
Now the European probe `` Venus express '' produced the proof - they sought out electromagnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere : the theory on the Venus shoot at a level of around 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud Christopher reported by the University of California in Los Angeles in science magazine `` nature '' .
According to the famous `` ursuppen-theorie '' theory that life on earth develop : thunderstorms should have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the formation of amino acids , the elements of life .
Not so on Venus : `` if it ever life over there , it must have been in the very early history '' , explain Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington .
Today , it is on the surface of the Venus little live : the atmosphere is approximately one hundred times more closely than on earth , there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees .
`` The Venus , is perhaps the of the earth , but it is a twin '' , said russel .
Why the Venus , the earth in mass and size is so similar to an entirely different development , is the basic question .
The start of `` Venus express '' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research , because , since the beginning of the nineties not probe more specifically to the study of this planet was on the way .
The latest research results now in several `` nature '' are introduced , emphasize according to the researchers , not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system .
`` they also show that the parallel our with the earth are greater than at first assumed , communicate the ESA .
So the researchers found in addition to the already well-known whirlwind at the North Pole , also a at still much faster .
This phenomenon reminds air on the earthly writes a group piccioni of the Italian Istituto by Giuseppe Di astrofisica spaziale e hemisphere .

Although the Venus with of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly the earth , scientists assume that both planet under very similar conditions developed .
On both water which remained on the earth in oceans , on Venus , but in the area was lost .

Climate propaganda
Since the both the sceptics of climate change and those that put a social and political debate in the foreground to a merciless criticism unterzieht , must the movement as a whole strong cohesion on the day .
Above all , if it is a question of a leader of the movement , as in the case of Zapatero , the fight against climate change for more important as regards the fight of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests a new contract with the planet to sign .
This proposal makes it , however , in a declaration concerning the action , or of his government , which has decisively contributed that Spain , within the European Union at the top of the countries which the guidelines of the least fulfilled .
Who are the persons responsible for the non-payment of the guidelines , on which sectors , and this is why his government has the contract with the planet had suggested , not stop this development .
In addition , he is now forced to the Spanish citizens of the intended measures against him to explain the climate change without beating about the bush .
What companies will be affected by the citizens , which is supposed to be changed , which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and what economic consequences arise from it .
More specifically , who sacrificed and pay for the rescue of the planet .
However , it has and there will be no such explanations in the future .
Just because it is a question of sacrificing and paying .
Because the measures against the climate change , which can really be used are unpopular .
They are uncomfortable and dangerous for the accounts of companies and citizens .
Even the proposed by the PSOE appeared Zapatero seen so dangerous that he felt compelled to take back the proposal again .
Accordingly , it is now the planet with nothing , therefore , with a pure propaganda and empty sayings , without any real consequences to save .
With impressive statements commissions , committees , protocols and new offices .
With its contracts with the planet , the otherwise so suitable for election campaigns politicians talk neither still accuse still claim , however , instead of demanding expenditure to follow the meeting decorate and with its quality of this and other inspire .
However , this can only happen if the Treaty does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not claim that the bicycle in the future the single progressive movement or we only with a fan may .

Political capital : Hungarian guard increases state risk
According to the department of risk analysis ( risk division ) of political capital activities in this August with support for the `` movement for a better Hungary '' founded Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and the region in more respect .
In the `` , the '' of the institute it means among other things : in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard represents the highest political risk the `` increase the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and in Hungary , even at short notice to violent discussions could lead '' .
The main reasons for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard , which probably on the provocation of such a discussion aims , so the Institute .
How will this report as a failure on the part of the politically responsible persons regarded : `` People of public life with representatives of the discussion of the radical political grouping , which now based their political strategy on the '' .
One assumes that this intensify the problem , the sensible dialogue impossible extremities as well as would increase the probability of violent arguments .
The forschungsinsitut means , the activities of the Hungarian guard , not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media , `` the picture of Hungary abroad substantially , particularly regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity concerns '' .
We remember : since the fall of 2006 , the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary continuously in the lift , so that , since the summer 2007 several `` national association '' calling organizations were founded .
`` these groupings in common that they each define as a civil organization , while it openly with the their members on - sometimes armed - tasks to prepare ( national protection , ) , with reference to the unsuitability of the police , the army or the state , it was said .
And further : all this in accordance with the method which is different to the policies and of the population , based , political efforts as civil initiative to disguise .
The emphasis of the civilian character and the help that is not only the avoidance of legal hurdles in the course of the registration with the Court could emerge - it is also a political strategy .
As the analysis has to be taken from the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk factor , also for the relations with the States .
`` in the last months of the Hungarian guard in several States as a potential source of so many quoted politician in certain countries , the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own .
All this has effects on the political stability of the region - it was said .
From the point of view of the research institute , the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not , therefore , in the political risk of increased for the entire region .
As reports , the activities of the Hungarian guard comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard , whose establishment in August 2007 by the Bulgarian 's National Union ( bnu ) was announced .
In the background to the emergence of the Bulgarian guard were the , which in a district of Sofia ( krasna poljana ) have taken place .
The bnu has the incidents equal opportunity for the establishment of the national guard , with the argument that the objective of the organization of the `` national protection '' .
In your opinion , namely in the last 17 years , a real `` terror '' in Bulgaria , the State remained however idle and indifferent , so political capital .
And further : the initiative would have an intense debate in the Bulgarian public kicked loose .
As said that the increased risk for ethnic discussions will also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard purposes .
Since the activities of the Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows , is it not exclude the fact that the Hungarian Roma also , with the organization of their own protection to the threats to react , it means in the risk of political capital .
Juhász Attila , in the case of political capital said on request of the report : the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute .
Every year would be published annually and should is recognizable tendencies , the public opinion informed , as in the case by the publication of the risk .

Cuba , the beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors , it is in fact an island of freedom .
What they expect of their holidays , that will be fulfilled if they select only the correct .
Golden and white beaches , high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond .
Palms and all inclusive with at the beach offer pizza , ice and beguiling cocktails .
Kitesurfing , Gulf and roulette .
On the islands of the Caribbean , you find that in measure .
Only on an island , however , still find it much more , and these island of Cuba is the largest and most beautiful great Antilles .
At present the Spaniards Cuba was the bastion for the capture of America .
It called Columbus the most beautiful place , which has seen a human eye .
Havana was once a camp or transit of treasures the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe .
And then came the American period .
The hotel as completely came into being at the end of the 20th century .
Building made it one of the leaders of the American mafia , Lucky Luciano for everything in the USA was regarded as a crime ( particularly during the prohibition on Cuba ) was most welcome and support , drugs , gambling , prostitution .
Under its guests , among other things .
Winston Churchill , ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
In Havana , grew drove over the broad boulevards cars , to the cult of the 1950s years among the ritual .
Ernest Hemingway bought a estate in San Francisco de Paula , near and he had in his yacht lie .
The walls of the bodeguita del Medio Star of behind and politicians from the whole of America their signatures .
And today ?
The walls of the bodeguita of Havana can also they leave it .
At the bar in the hotel as one for the whole cocktail desired .
And the cult of the 1950s to drive around in Havana until today , because the imported once and Fiats in the and damp air fell apart a long time ago .
This Havana , in particular its oldest part heavily anywhere , one finds in the vicinity so many colonial objects of interest as just here .
Other places are just straight , for example , Trinidad .
In regard to the urgently needed , that tourism brings money , there was for this development green light .
In the last fifteen years , not only in Havana new hotels developed , but also in varadero , on the coast of the province holguín and also on islets as cayo Coco , cayo Guillermo and others .
Cuba still offers a quirk which is unique in the world , and particularly railway lover .
The railways brought the steam of remote and to the factories .
Their fleet was not renewed over decades , and so one sees there and fully operating locomotives , their contemporaries contemporary elsewhere in the museum .
Trip goals
The places makes the majority of the visitors of Cuba .
So one must above varadero or Havana no longer have to write .
It only remains to mention that in the already mentioned estate a museum , whose visit that one of these writer , it should not miss .
The viñales-valley in the west of the island is one of the angles of Cuba .
The luxurious vegetation grows on lime soil .
The mogotas , lime hill and rocks tower steeply from the in their hollow accumulated fertile soil , through which also covered by a thick adopt .
It is this valley , where perhaps best Cuban tobacco cultivated .
In its final form , you can meet him if it one of the visit Havana .
Perhaps some also interesting , it appears that the Chilean , as a result of the television series of `` major Zeman '' was turned .
Trinidad
An ancient city , shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island , was set up .
The trade brought her glory and wealth with slaves and sugar .
The wealth embodied in the beauty of the small town .
The Spanish architecture , strongly influenced by the later French settlers , has hardly changed for four hundred years .
Trinidad , between the sea and the sited , is such a remote place that there was still in the fifties of the last century was no road , the area is connected with the rest of the country .
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained .
Nothing was built , but also therefore nothing down , everyone was glad that he had a roof over the head .
If one considers Trinidad more than one afternoon time has , then , it is interesting to look at places in the environment , such as the beach playa ancón or the valley of the factories `` .
In the evening , one should then in the Casa de la go according to the darkness , and where the music until tomorrow , not silent .
Baracoa
This completely in the East of Cuba some describe as the most beautiful the island .
Surely this opinion is also affected by the way there .
Both roads , the lead of Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerkueftete mountains and run by a landscape , which is scarcely touched by human interventions .
These Eastern Cuba took up the UNESCO owing to the there unaffected nature in her .
There is the best chocolate manufactured in the church , one shows the Cross of Columbus ( in reality , it is about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus developed ) , and of the hill , where the former castle , the present hotel Castillo , that is , to see that several of these El yunque is the best known .
Over the coffee , the rum , which cigars , the Sierra , the Bay and the island Isla de pinos over the heiligtum the Cuban patron caridad del cobre over the santeria an African religion , to which the descendants of slave declare , above all the one could write many pages .
However , as one says so : better with its own eyes looking .

Everything still open
Memo romey said that he considers it is not worthy of a presidential candidate , from a to be consulted .
In spite of this , the Republican candidate for the Presidency in the long run to a debate on to face in the ordinary voters ask video questions and submit it to the candidates to send .
None of the questions on Wednesday evening , the 28 November , were raised , as ridiculous as the snowman the Democrats about the global warming in the debate of the other party .
However , the questions and answers reflected this time exactly the condition of the Republican Party which bursts in the elections next year .
It is not known , exactly as the producers of CNN , the debate , the selected the candidates to selected the beginning .
However , in the first half hour of debate , the longest was dedicated to a single topic was immigration in the heart .
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans .
The CNN asked a group of manipulate voters to operate a if they heard things which they liked : the television noticed points of the agreement as the candidates strictly across the borders .
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between rudy Giuliani , the national outrider , and romney , the crucial inquiries in Hampshire and new pushed forward .
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call , it is flexible with regard to illegal immigration , when he was mayor of New York .
He attacked romney in it the former governor of Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for working on its House .
The two stopped especially hard as questioners asked whether one of the candidates , a `` Amnesty '' ( illegal a regular status and the way in which citizenship would give ) would support .
More insignificant candidates as Duncan hunter , a representative , and Tom tancredo , a representative from Colorado , in the case of this topic .
Neither of the two men has serious chances in the case of the nomination , but both of them remain in running , perhaps because they use and harder than other on which have hit .
At least in the field of immigration , the candidates and the same opinions : sharper borders , intolerance illegal migrants .
This subject , together with fears about toxic toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world , to help the Republicans , the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives to forget or to minimize .
But the debate was obviously problematic as other topics for the language .
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported in the past .
John McCain and romney discussed this , whether in regard should be regarded as torture .
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible .
This led to the point of view that Giuliani , that although the Bible preferential book , be it the history of jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale .
A further questioners asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
MIKE huckabee - now , contrary to all expectations in the first place , in a recent survey carried out in this one , owing to its Christian conservativism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary .
When he was pushed Jesus , whether they would approve it and it was said Jesus to intelligent in order to apply a political office .
Running remains extremely wide open .
Huckabees rise in falls together with Paul 's recent and its in the debate by Wednesday .
These two are from anything , because the two wings of the party has still not on one of the better known and more traditional candidates were able to agree .
In the year 2000 , a candidate in 1980 and the party from the outset and convincing reconciled with a victorious message about the size of America and a to both wing of the party .
The party is split this time , and the result is not at all clear .

The labour pains
Gordon Brown has yet another pit for falling ; his way out of this remains the same .
For British scandals , this is not particularly slippery .
No titles seem to have been sold politician Paris paid hotel bills toes , not to have been .
But the revelation that a rich businessman ruling for the British Labour Party on more than 650,000 pounds ( 1.3 million dollars ) over four years under the name of other people disguised and that the party failed to announce this is something without which the disputed Gordon Brown well would have managed .
When two months ago the Prime Minister of the demand for a choice had escaped way the intelligence of the British insulting when he said that public opinion polls , this decision would not have affected , there was hope that it would offer a robust , efficient government .
Instead , as vince , the increasingly astute agency chairmen of the Liberal Democrats , it expressed the brown feared once of Stalin bean developed .
The clumsy rescue of northern rock , a hit Bank weakness and bad discernment judgement under fire .
Badly thought out proposals to change the tax set against the government applied .
The loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative .
A trio of generals in retirement started a revolt in protest against the Upper House of military : to be Secretary of the armed forces , so you have claimed a partial .
Now there are the various contributions of David Abrahams ; Peter this labours Secretary-General ( and their former fulfilment leader ) has already resigned .
This means that brown breaks the direction of open .
Nevertheless , governments can reach a turning point , after which they feel it impossible to govern .
People still being allowed to trust politicians , but do they usually back their scepticism , if a new force takes the office .
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister to improve the situation , and it does not even need to be long , this delay is past : the public service starts to become leaky ; the cabinet ministers begin to ; the press looks for bad news ; and the government is defensive and secretaries .
In a way , the position of brown is particularly difficult , because he , in contrast to other political leaders can not claim to be a new broom .
So with pleasure it Tony Blair would deny that it was his .
The problems with northern rock and which , for example , hang together with decisions , the brown made as a Chancellor of the Exchequer .
And even if not directly involved in the misfortunes - as in the case of the `` money for nobility '' of a political party financing , the voters assume possibly , that he was it .
In spite of that situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The misdemeanours are not so terrible as the Conservatives describe it .
As in the case of bean , nobody died or completely .
And the remedy , painful as it may be , is to be delivered , which of course Stalinist tendencies always promised : a reliable , solid and easily brutal government .
The new fuss about political contributions is a good example .
The garboeske Abrahams its contributions with its gifts beneficial to the public , says he wants no public recognition for its goodwill .
That may be so , but perhaps the decision it was n't entitled to it .
The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason : the public has a right to know who can buy entrance to those who govern the country .
This says he would have known about Abraham 's agreement , but not the fact that it is illegal , will of course have to put some questions ; just as labours main finance which over the separate contributions in October were told .
But so far brown not involved : there is nothing that indicates that he knew about this confusion , although the largest part of the payments after taking office in June was made .
So far the Prime Minister finished half of the work .
He has quickly the violation of the law by his party , but he diluted this determination by reaching after a well-known instrument , a committee of inquiry on the subject - led , in order to make the measure full of a bishop in retirement and a judge .
In this instance , the `` it to be pulled out '' not very complicated .
If the law were broken , it is a matter for the police .
Apart from that , there are other things Mr Brown must , as something of a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life , to find the vacant for six months , and to make progress with a radical reform of a political party financing .
This would require the labour of the hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps the special financial relationship with the trade unions which - bitter pills for a party Member , as Mr Brown .
But it should be conscious of some partial facts .
The Conservatives have a clear direction now in the opinion polls ; it has two years to recover voters ; and the only way it can reach a victory , is through indisputable and Sturdy competence .

It all as to do - or as one becomes uninteresting
Stop and , the car right in the traffic .
From the radio a strange sang : the sound of a violin , coupled with electronic effects .
I turn to the higher volume .
The pace of changes to the previous sounds comes sounds and as a real a female chorus .
It is the song `` of love '' of that on onmr2 .
The local music has for a long time , not just with delicately .
However , now one sees even the back-up differently , when one hears the new album of .
The appearance of to so many new and exciting production from the local digital underground contribute slowly to a change of the overall picture , and even if the garage , with its gitarrengequit again `` , '' the domestic proves : there are new under the sun .
In pécs Balázs ranging , even in the volumes to before it , perhaps because a pub no two piper - its own path to follow .
The breakthrough with its project ( zagar ) and its music which elements from jazz , electronics and pop made it created , but only as one with the request the a film to compose it had approached ( e.g .
`` szezon '' of Ferenc toeroek ) .
The formation , which was originally appeared in smaller clubs , was known to the wider public first as the magazine `` wan2 '' their first album from the year 2002 among the top 50 local and zagar , together with the almost only to , even in the West trendsetter marketable .
Without a doubt , and its volume `` trendy '' , it is , however , not interested in whether they also like to bear this brand .
The volume reacted as it : with a new , still better album .
The new published now with the title `` can not walk fly '' could open up new paths for them , however , already the title expresses the desire for continuity with the pécser years .
The expression comes from the time when Balázs was still away with another band .
The airy , flying allusion would be in order , however , to fall apart from the character of the music - the time and the trend of appropriate louder the influences the rock 'n ' roll .
With these songs living in England and with the volume of `` the jigsaw puzzle '' working singer himself with the premiere in presented .
A song from album it even to the created - has been one of early to pop music late `` this pet the listeners with the number '' of love `` , the cooperation of six local singers ( `` `` ) was taken up gradually set .
Everything in order so ( ? ) .
The hvg.hu enquired at Balázs .
Hvg.hu : this new raises the question : to what extent does your music reserved for a certain layer ?
Balázs : the term `` , '' I do not just mean much .
In my opinion , there are two classes in the pop music , and indeed not mainstream and or alternative and pop but commercial and honestly .
Even the so-called alternative or underground can shallow and meaningless , just as they can also , however , only for the sale produced , which makes it commercial music .
Even a good can arise from an honest motive .
The acceptance of listener functions independently according to this principle , independently of languages and borders .
Hvg.hu : do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and of foreign public your music ?
As zs . Abroad , particularly to the west of us the pop music has a greater tradition .
There is not only teenagers or on concerts , but also the older public .
They pursue the trends in the pop music which happen around them , much more , because they also for a part of the contemporary culture .
Hvg.hu : what role is the public with your work ?
It is important , who , where , how many hear your music ?
As zs . : of course it is a good sense , to see that more and more to come to our concerts .
However , we have never for the market .
With us , music does not result in order to serve a purpose , but for a particular reason .
The role of the public is usually marked with the concerts , where there is already a mutual interaction , but there again only in the unreachable changes of the moment .
Nevertheless , one struck me : if you make it all right , you are not more interesting .
Hvg.hu : how far you to follow the example of ?
It is as away and his career in the West .
As zs . We do n't really its way , quite apart from the time that one tries again and again , this in our music .
We see rather than on the musical presence of other trust and it unfolded .
Originally were naturally compare our work with that of to inevitable , as several of us come from his band and have taken another way .
Hvg.hu : in the wings of `` wings of love '' stands in the first place .
Many have only in connection with this number belonged to the names .
Was the opening with a somewhat scale in the direction of a wider audience conscious ?
As zs . : we had no plans to write a of the then shall suffer for the album as .
In this song , it is a matter of more .
It was considered as a final of the , with which we , the and the somewhat more difficult subjects wanted to dissolve .
Hvg.hu : how have you the six selected ?
Why is it , which was the guidance principle ?
As zs . : the idea was to make a gospel chorus .
Then came the idea , the chorus from talented soloists of the local music scene .
So sechsköpfige chorus resulted , therefore , for sena edina kutzora , péterfy , eniko `` hodosi [ neo ] , sena , - , then we apäter '' `` underground .
Hvg.hu : you have the song exactly the same , or do have it the girls ?
As zs . : there was the number already longer in the version , but as the material for the was finished , we thought that this number is still `` something needs '' .
The piecework has really after a voice .
I have the melody still in the same night , then they have learned the girls .
It was practically everything at once and alarming spontaneously .
I can remember that at that time , I was quite , but it also has already the `` , '' required .
With my voice alone the song would never have become .
Hvg.hu : both on the record , and with the concert had one , but the impression , the girls were in the background .
There is no solo ( except for the short solo of ) , they do not have any of its own role , completely sing together and are not louder than the music , therefore , their gesang of music is not only accompanied .
Also on the stage they stood back .
Is it intention ?
B.zs . : that they stood behind , was so because of purely technical problems .
However , we wanted to make them aware of any social .
In number , it is also a matter of around the fact that one of its ego a little forget should forget who come from and where it is on the way , can we simply to us that this particular wing , the wings of love .
I would like that others also feel this euphoric condition , we felt , as the song developed .
Hvg.hu : what was the most complex song ?
As zs . Actually the musical none , it has been rather with more difficult tasks .
For example , in the case of `` dorian Gray 's dilemma '' , in which I on a play , or in the case of `` rock 'n ' roll goes to the girls , where the longer did not work , but gradually everything together , as in the case of a jigsaw puzzle .
Hvg.hu : what is your of the new album ?
As zs . : changes with the concerts constantly and now , where I have the `` losgelasssen '' .
At present there are `` prophet is a '' , `` escape from the earth '' and the number of `` the seed '' .
